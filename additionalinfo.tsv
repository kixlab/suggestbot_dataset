Select a level...	 Basic		  Intermediate		  Less energy is escaping to space: Carbon dioxide (CO2) acts like a blanket; adding more CO2 makes the 'blanket' thicker	 and humans are adding more CO2 all the time.    Climate Myth...  There's no empirical evidence  ""There is no actual evidence that carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming. Note that computer models are just concatenations of calculations you could do on a hand-held calculator	 so they are theoretical and cannot be part of any evidence."" (David Evans)    The proof that man-made CO2 is causing global warming is like the chain of evidence in a court case. CO2 keeps the Earth warmer than it would be without it. Humans are adding CO2 to the atmosphere	 mainly by burning fossil fuels. And there is empirical evidence that the rising temperatures are being caused by the increased CO2.    The Earth is wrapped in an invisible blanket    It is the EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s atmosphere that makes most life possible. To understand this	 we can look at the moon. On the surface	 the moonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s temperature during daytime can reach 100Ã‚Â°C (212Ã‚Â°F). At night	 it can plunge to minus 173Ã‚Â°C	 or -279.4Ã‚Â°F. In comparison	 the coldest temperature on Earth was recorded in Antarctica: Ã¢Ë†â€™89.2Ã‚Â°C (Ã¢Ë†â€™128.6Ã‚Â°F). According to the WMO	 the hottest was 56.7Ã‚Â°C (134Ã‚Â°F)	 measured on 10 July 1913 at Greenland Ranch (Death Valley).    Man could not survive in the temperatures on the moon	 even if there was air to breathe. Humans	 plants and animals canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tolerate the extremes of temperature on Earth unless they evolve special ways to deal with the heat or the cold. Nearly all life on Earth lives in areas that are more hospitable	 where temperatures are far less extreme.    Yet the Earth and the moon are virtually the same distance from the sun	 so why do we experience much less heat and cold than the moon? The answer is because of our atmosphere. The moon doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have one	 so it is exposed to the full strength of energy coming from the sun. At night	 temperatures plunge because there is no atmosphere to keep the heat in	 as there is on Earth.    The laws of physics tell us that without the atmosphere	 the Earth would be approximately 33Ã‚Â°C (59.4Ã‚Â°F) cooler than it actually is.    This would make most of the surface uninhabitable for humans. Agriculture as we know it would be more or less impossible if the average temperature was Ã¢Ë†â€™18 Ã‚Â°C. In other words	 it would be freezing cold even at the height of summer.    The reason that the Earth is warm enough to sustain life is because of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases act like a blanket	 keeping the Earth warm by preventing some of the sunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s energy being re-radiated into space. The effect is exactly the same as wrapping yourself in a blanket Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it reduces heat loss from your body and keeps you warm.    If we add more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere	 the effect is like wrapping yourself in a thicker blanket: even less heat is lost. So how can we tell what effect CO2 is having on temperatures	 and if the increase in atmospheric CO2 is really making the planet warmer?    One way of measuring the effect of CO2 is by using satellites to compare how much energy is arriving from the sun	 and how much is leaving the Earth. What scientists have seen over the last few decades is a gradual decrease in the amount of energy being re-radiated back into space. In the same period	 the amount of energy arriving from the sun has not changed very much at all. This is the first piece of evidence: more energy is remaining in the atmosphere."	https://skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-global-warming.htm	Google	2	1		1028	Which adds up to you have no more idea whether global warming is actually happening nor whether man is the cause of it than I have. 	global warming	635748	climate change462	"Just under half a million people (420	000) died of AIDS-related illnesses in the region in 2016	 although the number of deaths has fallen significantly from 760	000 in 2010"	https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/overview	HIV in Africa	2	2		68	"Many areas in the world are overpopulated	 of course HIV is thinning out the population in Africa and was unexpected.

Measurements of physical properties such as position	 momentum	 spin	 and polarization	 performed on entangled particles are found to be correlated. For example	 if a pair of particles is generated in such a way that their total spin is known to be zero	 and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a certain axis	 the spin of the other particle	 measured on the same axis	 will be found to be counterclockwise	 as is to be expected due to their entanglement. However	 this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a property of a particle performs an irreversible collapse on that particle and will change the original quantum state. In the case of entangled particles	 such a measurement will be on the entangled system as a whole.    Such phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein	 Boris Podolsky	 and Nathan Rosen	[1] and several papers by Erwin SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger shortly thereafter	[2][3] describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior to be impossible	 as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as ""spooky action at a distance"")[4] and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.    Later	 however	 the counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics were verified experimentally[5] in tests where the polarization or spin of entangled particles were measured at separate locations	 statistically violating Bell's inequality. In earlier tests it couldn't be absolutely ruled out that the test result at one point could have been subtly transmitted to the remote point	 affecting the outcome at the second location.[6] However so-called ""loophole-free"" Bell tests have been performed in which the locations were separated such that communications at the speed of light would have taken longerÃ¢â‚¬â€ùin one case 10	000 times longerÃ¢â‚¬â€ùthan the interval between the measurements."	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement	Google	2	1		640	"AGW predicts events that cant be proved	 confirmed or demonstrated in the same way as the principles of quantum theory.

Excel's RAND() function yields a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.

To create a Monte Carlo simulation of an insurance pool of 1	000 drivers	 I copied the formula =INT(RAND()+0.01) down a column of 1	000 cells to represent the drivers.  The sum of this column represents the number of accident claims from the pool.  The number of claims changes each time the worksheet is recalculated	 and varies randomly around an expected value of 10.    So I ran 1	000 recalculations of this worksheet	 using an Excel macro to record the column sums from these cells	 representing the number of accidents that occurred in each trial of the insurance pool.
