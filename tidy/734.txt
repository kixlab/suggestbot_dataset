List 10 Types of Solids, Liquids, and Gases
Naming examples of solids, liquids, and gases is a common homework assignment because it makes you think about phase changes and the states of matter.

Examples of Solids

Solids are a form of matter that has a definite shape and volume.

Gold Wood Sand Steel Brick Rock Copper Brass Apple Aluminum foil Ice Butter

Examples of Liquids

Liquids are a form of matter that has a definite volume but no defined shape. Liquids can flow and assume the shape of their container.

Water Milk Blood Urine Gasoline Mercury (an element) Bromine (an element) Wine Rubbing alcohol Honey Coffee

Examples of Gases

A gas is a form of matter that does not have a defined shape or volume. Gases expand to fill the space they are given.

Air Helium Nitrogen Freon Carbon dioxide Water vapor Hydrogen Natural gas Propane Oxygen Ozone Hydrogen sulfide

Phase Changes

Depending on the temperature and pressure, the matter may transition from one state into another:

Solids may melt into liquids

Solids may sublimate into gases (sublimation)

Liquids may vaporize into gases

Liquids may freeze into solids

Gases may condense into liquids

Gases may deposit into solids (deposition)
