However, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales reportedly finds flying first class "incredibly uncomfortable."

According to The Times, a new biography on the prince written by US author Sally Bedell Smith reveals that when travelling to America to accept an environmental leadership award in 2007, the prince opted to fly first class on board a scheduled flight along with his 14-strong entourage.

The staunch environmentalist was reportedly attempting to reduce his carbon footprint by reducing his use of private charters.

However, the book claims that while on his return flight home, he wrote a letter to a friend complaining about the "incredibly uncomfortable" seats located in the upper class deck, and longed for the use of his own private jet.

The Prince and Duchess of Cornwall's travel arrangements made the headlines once again last week, when they were criticised for booking Prime Minister Theresa May's RAF Voyager jet for their nine-day European charm offensive, following the triggering of Article 50.

While the jet is thought to have been flying half empty between destinations for the royal couple's soft diplomatic duties, Theresa May was forced to hire a costly Boeing 757 from a charter firm for her three-day trip to the Middle East, where she was to conduct crucial new trade agreements.
