Saving Lives from Drug Addiction
Narconon was founded in 1966 based on the discoveries and writings of author, humanitarian and Scientology Founder L. Ron Hubbard. Today, Narconon constitutes a worldwide network that daily helps people recover from the devastation of drug addiction.

Narconon drug rehabilitation methods, all drug-free, combine a precise regimen that eliminates drug residues from the body with procedures to alleviate the mental and physical anguish connected with drugs.

Narconon not only addresses the debilitating effects of drug abuse on both mind and body, but also resolves the reasons why a person turned to drugs in the first place. To date, the program has helped tens of thousands start a new life free from drugs.

But Narconon doesnâ€™t stop there; it reaches out to inform young people and adults about drugs and drug abuse through its education and prevention program. To date Narconon drug education specialists have directly reached more than 16 million individuals.

True freedom for the individual cannot be attained in a world awash with substance abuse and drug addiction. That is why the Church of Scientology is fully committed to programs that effectively address this social issue.
