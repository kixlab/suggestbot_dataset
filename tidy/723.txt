What Do Cows Eat?
Cows thrive on plants, and unlike other animals, they don't have upper front teeth rather a tough dental pad on the top. After a cow is chomping on grass, it has the ability to bring back the grass from the stomach to their mouth to re-chew it. They re-chew it with their strong molars to break it down for easy digestion.
