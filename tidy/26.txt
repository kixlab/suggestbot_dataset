List of smoking bans in the United States
The following is a list of smoking bans in the United States. For smoking bans and restrictions outside the United States, see the worldwide list of smoking bans.

The United States Congress has not attempted to enact any type of nationwide federal smoking ban. Therefore, smoking bans in the United States are entirely a product of first-level jurisdictional, local criminal, and occupational safety and health laws.

In 1995, California was the first state to enact a statewide smoking ban; throughout the early to mid-2000s, especially between 2004 and 2007, an increasing number of states enacted a statewide smoking ban of some kind. As of July 2018, the most recent statewide smoking ban is Alaska's, which was signed into law on July 18, 2018, and went into effect on October 1, 2018.

As further detailed in this list, smoking laws vary widely throughout the United States. Some places in the United States do not generally regulate smoking at all, some ban smoking in certain areas and not others, and some ban smoking nearly everywhere, even in outdoor areas (no state bans smoking in all public outdoor areas, but some local jurisdictions do). As of July 1, 2017, according to the American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation, 81.5% of the U.S. population lives under a ban on smoking in "workplaces, and/or restaurants, and/or bars, by either a state, commonwealth, or local law",[1] and 58.6% live under a ban covering all workplaces and restaurants and bars.[2] A smoking ban (either state or local) has been enacted covering all bars and restaurants in each of the 60 most populated cities in the United States except these 11: Atlanta, Jacksonville, Memphis, Miami, Las Vegas, Nashville, Oklahoma City, Philadelphia, Tampa, Tulsa, and Virginia Beach. New Hampshire allows smoking in some private member's clubs where alcohol is served.[3][4]

Overview [ edit ]

Statewide bans on smoking in all enclosed public places [ edit ]

As of July 2018, 26 states have enacted statewide bans on smoking in all enclosed workplaces, including all bars and restaurants: Alaska, Arizona, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Twelve other states have enacted statewide smoking bans but have carved out an exception for certain establishments and workplaces: Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.

However, these states exempt a variety of places from their respective smoking bans. All except seven (California, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, Utah, Vermont, and Washington) exempt tobacconists. All except six (Alaska, Michigan, Indiana, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin) allow hotels and motels to designate a certain percentage of smoking rooms. Many also exempt or do not cover casinos (10), private clubs (8), cigar bars (14), or certain small workplaces (8). The following is a table of common exemptions from these 28 states' smoking bans:

States that exempt tobacconists States that exempt cigar bars States that exempt private clubs States that exempt casinos States that exempt small workplaces AK, AZ, CA, CO, CT, HI, KS, IL, IA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, NE, NJ, NM, NY, OH, OR, RI, SD, TN, WI AK, CA, CO, CT, MA, MI, NE, NJ, NM, NY, OR, RI, SD, TN, WI AK, AZ, CT, IA, KS, MA, NY, OH, TN CT, IA, KS, ME, TN (OTB parlors, beano and bingo halls), MI, MN, NJ (including OTB parlors), NM, RI (including OTB parlors), WI CO & TN (3 or fewer employees), CT (5 or fewer employees), ND (1 employee), NM (1 employee), OH (family owned and operated), UT (1 employee), VT (1 employee)

In Connecticut, Oregon, Montana, Utah, and Wisconsin, the state law preempts local governments from enacting stricter smoking bans than the state, though some cities and/or counties in some of those states have enacted local versions of the state's smoking ban. In the other 23 states with a statewide general smoking ban, some cities and/or counties have enacted stricter local smoking bans to varying degrees. In California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, and Vermont, usage of e-cigarettes is prohibited indoors. The strictest smoking ban in the United States is in Calabasas, California, where smoking anywhere a non-smoker could congregate, including public sidewalks and apartment complexes, is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of at least $250.[5]

Statewide smoking bans exempting adult-only venues [ edit ]

As of July 2017, six states ban smoking in most enclosed public places, but permit adult venues such as bars (and casinos, if applicable) to allow smoking if they choose: Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Iowa and Nevada. In Florida, state law preempts local governments from enacting stricter smoking bans than the state, though in Idaho, Indiana, and Louisiana, some cities and/or counties have enacted stricter local smoking bans to varying degrees, in some cases banning it in all enclosed workplaces. See individual state listings below for details.

Unique statewide smoking bans [ edit ]

As of July 2018, 5 states have enacted smoking bans in particular places that do not fit in the other categories:

Alaska bans smoking in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants, but allows smoking in private clubs that were in existence prior to January 1, 2017, and allows for certain localities such as villages to opt out of the law bars (which can be 100% smoking) and small workplaces (which can have a designated smoking area); local governments in Idaho can regulate smoking more strictly than the state.

Nevada generally bans smoking in all public places and places of employment, but exempts bars, casinos, strip clubs, brothels, and retail tobacco stores, and restaurants that do not allow patrons under 21 years of age. In all other restaurants, smoking is relegated to separately ventilated designated smoking areas. Local governments in Nevada may regulate smoking more strictly than the state.

New Hampshire bans smoking in restaurants and some bars (those besides cigar bars and private clubs), schools, and certain common areas open to the public, but not anywhere else, and state law prohibits local governments from enacting local smoking bans.

North Carolina bans smoking in all restaurants and bars (excluding cigar bars and private clubs), as well as government buildings and vehicles, but does not regulate smoking anywhere else. Local governments may regulate smoking more strictly than the state, except in cigar bars, private clubs, tobacco shops, private residences/vehicles, designated hotel/motel smoking rooms, and theatrical performances involving smoking.

States with no statewide smoking ban [ edit ]

As of July 2018, 12 states have not enacted any general statewide ban on smoking in workplaces and/or bars and/or restaurants: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Instead, laws in most of these states (see individual state listings below for further information) require proprietors of certain places to designate smoking and non-smoking areas and post warning signage.

In Oklahoma and Virginia state laws prohibit local governments from regulating smoking more strictly than the state, making those states among the fewest in the nation without any legislated smoking bans. In the other ten states, cities and/or counties have enacted stricter smoking laws than the state, in some cases banning smoking in all enclosed workplaces. In Alabama and Mississippi, the state smoking law expressly allows all local governments to do so. In Alaska, Kentucky, Missouri, South Carolina, Texas, and West Virginia, a court has ruled that certain local governments have the power to do so. See the individual state listings below for details.

Smoking laws and non-states [ edit ]

In the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, smoking is banned in all enclosed public places, including bars and restaurants. Guam prohibits smoking in restaurants, but the ban doesn't extend to workplaces or any other businesses. The Northern Mariana Islands prohibits smoking in most workplaces and restaurants, but not in bars.

Smoking laws and the U.S. federal government [ edit ]

Although Congress has not attempted to enact a general nationwide federal smoking ban in workplaces, several federal regulations do concern indoor smoking. Effective April 1998, inflight smoking is banned by the United States Department of Transportation on all commercial passenger flights in the United States, and/or by American air carriers.[6] This was long after Delta Air Lines had banned smoking on all of its flights. On August 9, 1997, President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 13058, banning smoking in all interior spaces owned, rented, or leased by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government, as well as in any outdoor areas under executive branch control near air intake ducts.[7]

Smoking laws of the United States by state or territory [ edit ]

Alabama [ edit ]

Alaska [ edit ]

Statewide smoking ban: On October 1, 2018, after being signed into law on July 18, 2018, smoking was banned statewide in all enclosed public places, including bars, restaurants, private clubs, hotels/motels, outdoor arenas, playgrounds and parks. The law exempts (1) a vehicle that is a place of employment when the vehicle is used exclusively by one person, (2) on a vessel when the vessel is engaged in commercial fishing or sport charter fishing, (3) a private club if the private club has been in continuous operation at the same location since January 1, 2017; is not licensed to serve alcoholic beverages; and is not a place of employment, (4) at a private residence, except a private residence described in (b) of 27 section or while a health care provider is present, (5) in a stand-alone shelter if the stand-alone shelter meets the following requirements: food or drink may not be sold or served in the stand-alone shelter; and the stand-alone shelter meets the minimum distance requirements of 10 feet (3.0 m), and (6) allows smoking so long as it's not within 10 feet (3.0 m) of all places where smoking is prohibited. Localities may regulating smoking more stringently than the state, and the bill also allows for certain municipalities such as villages to exempt certain establishments, including bars and restaurants from the bill if they see fit.[17][18]

American Samoa [ edit ]

Territory-wide smoking ban. On October 20, 2010 Governor Togiola Tulafono signed into law the American Samoa Smoke Free Environment Act, a Fono (Legislature) bill passed earlier in the year. The bill went into effect on January 20, 2011.[19]

Arizona [ edit ]

Statewide smoking ban: On May 1, 2007, the Smoke Free Arizona Act (Proposition 201) went into effect after passage by 54.7% of voters the prior November, banning smoking in all enclosed workplaces and within 20 feet (6.1 m) of an entrance or exit of such a place, including bars and restaurants, only exempting private residences, retail tobacco stores, private clubs, smoking associated with American Indian religious ceremonies, outdoor patios, and stage/film/television performances; local governments may enact stricter regulations than the state. The law does not cover businesses located on Indian Reservations, as the reservations are sovereign nations.[20][21][22]

Arkansas [ edit ]

No statewide smoking ban. Instead, Arkansas's statewide smoking law, the Arkansas Clean Indoor Air Act of 2006, bans smoking in most enclosed workplaces in Arkansas, exempting private residences, hotel and motel rooms designated as smoking rooms, workplaces with fewer than three employees, retail tobacco stores, designated areas in nursing homes, outdoor areas, workplaces of tobacco manufacturers (and importers and wholesalers), bars and restaurants that do not allow patrons younger than 21, and gaming floors of operations regulated by the Arkansas Racing Commission. [23] Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the state law. [24] At the same time, the Arkansas Protection from Secondhand Smoke for Children Act of 2006 went into effect, prohibiting smoking in a motor vehicle carrying a child under age six years old who weighs less than 60 pounds and is in a car seat. [25]

California [ edit ]

Statewide smoking ban: Since January 1, 1995, smoking has been banned in all enclosed workplaces in California, including bars and restaurants (bars were excluded until January 1, 1998); these following areas were exempt until June 9, 2016: meeting and banquet rooms except while food or beverage functions are taking place (including set-up, service, and clean-up activities or when the room is being used for exhibit activities), retail or wholesale tobacco shops and private smokers lounges (i.e. cigar bars), truck cabs/tractors if no nonsmoking employees are present, theatrical production sites if smoking is an integral part of the story, medical research or treatment sites if smoking is integral to the research or treatment being conducted, private residences except homes licensed as family day care homes during the hours of operation and in those areas where children are present, and patient smoking areas in long-term health care facilities.[26]

Effective January 1, 2004, California bill AB846 bans smoking within 20 feet (6.1 m) of the entrance or operable window of a public building ("public building" means a building owned and occupied, or leased and occupied, by the state, a county, a city, a city and county, or a California Community College district.) The law also prohibits smoking in state owned vehicles.[27][28]

Additionally, effective January 1, 2008, smoking in a moving vehicle while in the presence of a minor (18 years or younger) is an infraction; the charge is not serious enough to be pulled over, and only can be cited along with a stricter offense, such as a moving violation or traffic accident.[29][30]

Local jurisdictions may regulate smoking more strictly than the state. Many California communities have established smoke-free registries for private residential apartment buildings, which range from complexes where smoking is entirely prohibited (whether inside private dwellings or outside) to those where certain sections of dwellings may be designated as smoking dwellings. Most California cities allow landlords to regulate smoking at will.

In 2012, the California Legislature passed the following into law, California Civil Code Section 1947.5. (a) A landlord of a residential dwelling unit, as defined in Section 1940, or his or her agent, may prohibit the smoking of a cigarette, as defined in Section 104556 of the Health and Safety Code, or other tobacco product on the property or in any building or portion of the building, including any dwelling unit, other interior or exterior area, or the premises on which it is located, in accordance with this article. (b) (1) Every lease or rental agreement entered into on or after January 1, 2012, for a residential dwelling unit on property on any portion of which the landlord has prohibited the smoking of cigarettes or other tobacco products pursuant to this article shall include a provision that specifies the areas on the property where smoking is prohibited, if the lessee has not previously occupied the dwelling unit. (2) For a lease or rental agreement entered into before January 1, 2012, a prohibition against the smoking of cigarettes or other tobacco products in any portion of the property in which smoking was previously permitted shall constitute a change of the terms of tenancy, requiring adequate notice in writing, to be provided in the manner prescribed in Section 827. (c) A landlord who exercises the authority provided in subdivision (a) to prohibit smoking shall be subject to federal, state, and local requirements governing changes to the terms of a lease or rental agreement for tenants with leases or rental agreements that are in existence at the time that the policy limiting or prohibiting smoking is adopted. (d) This section shall not be construed to preempt any local ordinance in effect on or before January 1, 2012, or any provision of a local ordinance in effect on or after January 1, 2012, that restricts the smoking of cigarettes or other tobacco products. (e) A limitation or prohibition of the use of any tobacco product shall not affect any other term or condition of the tenancy, nor shall this section be construed to require statutory authority to establish or enforce any other lawful term or condition of the tenancy. (Added by Stats. 2011, Ch. 264, Sec. 2. Effective January 1, 2012.) [61]

It established an on-premises cigar, beverage, and liquor license and allowed for cigar smoking at public cigar bars.[282] Towns only can regulate smoking more strictly with regard to fire safety and sanitation.[283] In 2003, the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled that this means state law preempts towns from enacting stricter local smoking bans for health reasons.[284]

A ruling by the 10th District Court of Appeals in Columbus upheld the law, stating that a bar owner had intentionally violated it. The bar owner, facing violations and fines totaling $33,000, brought suit, claiming the ban is unconstitutional. On May 23, 2012, The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the ruling of the Tenth District Court of Appeals. [318]

North Royalton, April 16, 2008, passed Ordinance 08-69 banning smoking in public outdoor places owned by the city. Smoking areas may be designated at the mayor's discretion. [319]

Oklahoma [ edit ]

No statewide smoking ban. Instead, Oklahoma's statewide smoking law prohibits smoking in any indoor workplaces – including restaurants and hotels – unless a separate ventilation system under negative pressure is installed for ventilating the smoking area, but permits smoking without limitation in bars, private clubs, bingo halls, retail tobacco stores, small family-owned workplaces, workplaces occupied exclusively by smokers, veterans' halls, and designated employee smoking areas.[321][322] The Oklahoma law expressly preempts local governments from enacting any local smoking regulations that are not exactly the same as the state law.[323] In February 2009, a committee of the Oklahoma Senate rejected a proposed ban on smoking in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants, and a similar bill before the Oklahoma House of Representatives failed when it was denied a committee hearing.[324] In May 2009, a bill before the Oklahoma House of Representatives to repeal the preemption on stricter local smoking regulation failed when it did not receive a committee hearing.[325]

Oregon [ edit ]

Statewide smoking ban: Effective January 1, 2009, after being signed into law on June 26, 2007, the 1981 Oregon Indoor Clean Air Act (as previously amended in 2001) was amended to ban smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in Oregon, including bars and restaurants, as well as within 10 feet (3.0 m) of the entrances, exits, or windows of such places.[326] The Act exempts (1) private residences except when serving as a childcare or adult care facility,[327] (2) designated hotel/motel smoking rooms, (3) spaces designated for traditional American Indian religious and cultural ceremonies, (4) retail tobacco shops, and (5) cigar bars.[328] Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the Act;[329] and the Oregon Court of Appeals reiterated this in 2000.[330]

[332] Local governments except Philadelphia are preempted from regulating smoking more stringently than the Act. [332] Philadelphia's smoking ordinance, which went into effect on January 8, 2007, bans smoking in all restaurants, exempting bars where food accounts for less than 10% of sales and alcohol accounts for more than 90% of sales, and persons under 18 are prohibited. [333] Philadelphia's ordinance is the only local smoking ban in Pennsylvania. [4] On April 29, 2014, Mayor Michael Nutter passed an executive order banning smoking in all city parks. [334] Allegheny County enacted a smoking ban October 2006, but it was immediately challenged in court as violating the 1988 Clean Indoor Air Act's preemption of all local smoking regulations. [335] In May 2007, the ban was overturned by the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court. [335]

'Smoking-Free Beaches' Program: Pennsylvania's 'Smoke-Free Beaches' program was initiated by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. This program places smoking constraints at designated parks to eliminate smoking on beaches and swimming areas. For visitors who smoke and still want to use these beaches, designated areas adjacent to the beach are provided. The restriction includes cigarettes, pipes, cigars and the increasingly popular e-cigarettes. Staff at newly affected parks have been preparing for the change by purchasing and installing butt disposal units; installing new signage; establishing designated smoking areas with seating; and informing park user and support groups. In 2016, 12 state parks initiated new "Smoke Free Beaches." They were: Hills Creek, Tioga County; Lyman Run, Potter County; R.B. Winter, Union; Presque Isle, Erie; Pymatuning, Crawford, Laurel Hill, Somerset County; Whipple Dam, Huntingdon County; Gifford Pinchot, York County; Cowans Gap, Fulton County; Gouldsboro, Monroe County; Ricketts Glen, Luzerne County; and Worlds End, Sullivan.

South Carolina [ edit ]

South Dakota [ edit ]

Statewide smoking ban: South Dakota voters passed 2009 H.B. 1240 on November 10, 2010. The bill bans smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in South Dakota, including bars and restaurants,[356] exempting only private residences unless used for child daycare,[356] cigar bars, retail tobacco shops, and a percentage of hotel and motel rooms.[357] The bill was passed in the South Dakota State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Mike Rounds. It was scheduled to take effect in July 2009, but on June 22, 2009, a group of casino and video lottery operators presented the Secretary of State with a petition for a referendum over H.B. 1240 that they claimed to bear 25,000 valid signatures.[358] On June 25, 2009, the Secretary of State certified that the petition indeed bore at least the required 16,776 valid signatures, putting H.B. 1240 to the November 2010 public referendum.[359] On July 24, 2009, the Secretary of State declared that after further review, the number of valid signatures on the petition fell short of the required number to put the issue on the ballot.[360] On November 13, 2009, however, Circuit Judge Kathleen Trandahl ruled that the petition did have enough valid signatures, and ordered the Secretary of State to put the issue to a public vote on November 2, 2010,[361] which ultimately passed. H.B. 1240 is silent as to whether local governments may regulate smoking more stringently, though as of November 2010 no local governments in South Dakota have done so.

Utah [ edit ]

Statewide smoking ban : Effective January 1, 2007, as passed in March 2006 (amended in 2012), [388] Utah's 1995 Indoor Clean Air Act was expanded to ban smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in Utah, including bars and restaurants (bars and private clubs were exempt until January 1, 2009), exempting only (1) designated hotel/motel smoking rooms, (2) areas of owner-operated businesses with no employees besides the owner, [389] and (3) American Indian religious and cultural ceremonies. [390] Since the state law supersedes any ordinances passed by political subdivisions of the state (i.e., cities, counties, school districts, agencies, etc.), such political subdivisions are preempted from regulating indoor smoking any more or less stringently than the Act. [391] Utah is one of the few states with a statewide smoking ban that does not exempt tobacconists. Local outdoor smoking bans : Notwithstanding the preemption against political subdivisions modifying the restrictions on indoor smoking, the Act expressly allows such political subdivisions to regulate "smoking in outdoor places of public access which are owned or operated by" (emphasis added) a political subdivision (specifically including state institutions of public or higher education). [391] Accordingly, some political subdivisions have enacted local ordinances prohibiting smoking in certain outdoor areas such as schools, parks, [392] and public transit facilities. [393]

Statewide smoking ban: Effective September 1, 2005, smoking is banned in all enclosed workplaces in Vermont, including all bars and restaurants,[394] except in areas of owner-operated businesses with no employees that are not open to the public,[395] although separately ventilated designated smoking areas in businesses where employees are not required to be were exempt until July 1, 2009.[396] Designated unenclosed smoking areas in businesses where the layout of the workplace is such that smoking would not be a physical irritation to any nonsmoking employee and three-fourths of the employees agreed were also exempt until July 1, 2009.[396] The Vermont Veterans Home in Bennington is the only non-owner-operated workplace in the state permitted to allow smoking.[396] Vermont is one of the few states with a statewide smoking ban that does not expressly exempt tobacconists, and is one of four states that does not allow the designation of hotel/motel smoking rooms. Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the state law.[397][398]

Instead, Virginia's 2009 statewide smoking law, the 2009 Indoor Clean Air Act prohibits smoking statewide in enclosed public elevators, public school buses, primary and secondary schools, hospital emergency rooms, health department offices, polling places, indoor service lines and cashier lines, public restrooms in government buildings and hospitals, child daycare centers except where located in a private home, and public restrooms of health care facilities, and relegating smoking in restaurants (including bars) to separately ventilated designated smoking rooms that are structurally separated from the rest of the establishment.[399][400] The Act exempts private clubs, retail tobacco stores, tobacco warehouses, tobacco manufacturing facilities, prisons, designated smoking areas in government offices, food preparation facilities for catering services, restaurants located on the premises of tobacco manufacturers, rented private rooms in restaurants; requires the reasonable designation of non-smoking areas in educational facilities where smoking is not banned, hospitals, retail stores bigger than 15,000 square feet (1,400 m2), and recreational facilities.[399]

Local governments are preempted from regulating smoking more stringently than the Act.[399] Effectively, the cost and complexity involved with complying with the law's requirements for separately ventilated smoking areas has meant that nearly all Virginia bars and restaurants operate completely smoke-free. Since 2006, smoking in state offices, vehicles, and buildings (except for correctional facilities) has been banned by executive order issued by the Governor of Virginia.[401] A law which came into effect on July 1, 2016 banned smoking in private cars with any occupants who are 8 years or younger.[402]

Norfolk, March 25, 2008, repealed a ban on smoking in restaurants, which was passed in October 2007 but had not yet gone into effect, by City Council vote of 5–2, because the City Attorney advised the Council that its ban would violate Virginia state law and could not withstand a legal challenge.

Washington [ edit ]

Statewide smoking ban : On December 8, 2005, after ratification by a majority of Washington voters in a statewide initiative referendum, an amendment to Washington's 1985 Clean Indoor Air Act became effective banning smoking statewide in all public places and places of employment in Washington (except 25% of hotel/motel rooms), [404] as well as within 25 feet (7.6 m) of doors, windows, or ventilation intakes to such places. [405] The act exempts private enclosed workplaces [406] and private residences except when being used to provide licensed childcare, foster care, adult care, or other similar social service care. [407] Washington does not provide exemptions for tobacconists or businesses whose sole purpose is to provide an environment for smoking (e.g. hookah lounges, cigar bars). However, private clubs in enclosed spaces with no employees, and businesses on tribal lands, are exempt. Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the act, [406] and local health boards are authorized to enforce the act locally. [408] Mason County, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants [4]

Wisconsin [ edit ]

Statewide smoking ban: On July 5, 2010, after being signed into law by Governor Jim Doyle on May 18, 2009, S.B. 181 (2009 Wisconsin Act 12) took effect, banning smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in Wisconsin, including all bars, restaurants, lodging establishments, and private clubs, as well as within a "reasonable distance" outdoors from any such place, except in bar/restaurant outdoor patios.[420] The Act exempts only cigar bars or retail tobacco stores already in existence, private residences, and rooms in nursing homes in which the occupants agree to allow smoking; it does not cover casinos run by American Indian tribes, as those casinos are in the tribes' sovereign territory.[420] Local governments are preempted from regulating smoking more strictly than the Act.[420] Prior to this law taking effect, several localities in Wisconsin had local smoking bans in effect.

Wyoming [ edit ]

No statewide smoking ban. Instead, Wyoming state law only prohibits smoking where it could cause an explosion [422] [423] [424] and in underground mines. [425] Wyoming has no state laws concerning indoor smoking in general, and thus local governments can regulate general indoor smoking as they see fit. As of July 2017, six cities in Wyoming have enacted local smoking bans, all covering all bars and restaurants, but varying otherwise. [4] In February 2009, a bill before the Wyoming Legislature that would have enacted a statewide ban on smoking in all enclosed workplaces, except in private offices and in bars and restaurants serving only patrons over 21 years of age (and except in any local community that chose to opt out) failed when it was passed by the Wyoming House of Representatives in a vote of 31–29 but then was denied a committee hearing in the Wyoming Senate.
