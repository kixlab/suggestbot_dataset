Poll: Record number of Americans believe in man-made climate change
A record number of Americans believe that global warming is real and that humans are at least partially responsible, according to a new poll from the University of Michigan's Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy.

The survey says that 60 percent of respondents say that global warming is taking place and that human activity is either primarily or partially why temperatures are rising. That passes a previous high of 58 percent, which was recorded in 2008, 2009 and 2017.

Thirty-four percent of respondents said that humans were primarily responsible for global warming, while 26 percent said human activity was partially responsible.

On the other hand, 12 percent of respondents said that climate change was caused by natural patterns, with another 12 percent saying they weren't sure if it is occurring at all. Fifteen percent of respondents said the climate is not changing.

In addition, the poll found that more Americans believe there is solid evidence of global warming than at any time since 2008. Seventy-three percent of respondents agreed with the statement.

There is a stark divide along party lines, with 50 percent of Republicans saying they believe there is solid evidence of global warming, compared to 90 percent of Democrats. The divide is the largest since 2008.

The survey was conducted from April 29 to May 25 among a population of 751 adults. The margin of error is 4 percentage points.
