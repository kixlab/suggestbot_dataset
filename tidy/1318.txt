Comparing Population Densities of Australia, Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand and U.S.A.
For the Mr. Avery and Class "Our World Our Numbers post"...

Of Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand and U.S.A., which country is largest by population density?

Seeing a post looking at people and land area, I wondered how the population densities of Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand and U.S.A. might compare.

Population density is how many people there are for every square kilometre or mile of land area in a country. We take the population of a country and divide by the land area.

Which country has the highest population density?

The United Kingdom

Let's look at the order of the countries according to the information I used to find the answer.

Area

1. U.S.A. (9,826,675 square kilometres)

2. Canada (9,984,670 square kilometres)

3. Australia (7,692,024 square kilometres)

4. New Zealand (268,680 square kilometres)

5. United Kingdom (243,610 square kilometres)

Population

1. U.S.A. (314,000,000)

2. United Kingdom (62,640,000)

3. Canada (34,480,000)

4. Australia (23,000,000)

5. New Zealand (4,466,424)

Population Density

1. United Kingdom (257.13 people per square kilometres)

2. U.S.A. (31.95 people per square kilometres)

3. New Zealand (16.62 people per square kilometres)

4. Canada (3.45 people per square kilometres)

5. Australia (2.99 people per square kilometres)

I was asked to supply a chart (graph). This column graph has been inserted to show relative population densities, including Japan mentioned in the comment section.

.

Can you see the smallest country by area has the highest population density? (N.B. Adding Japan changed this slightly as it became the third smallest country by area yet had the highest population density.)

We must remember, when looking at Canada and Australia and their low population densities, Canada has large parts of the country in Arctic regions and Australia has large areas of desert. Below is a link I made comparing Great Britain and Australia. It gives information about Australia and its land.
