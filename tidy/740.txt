Analysis / Bias

NBC News is what some call a mainstream media source. They typically publish/report factual news that uses moderately loaded words in headlines such as this: Trump threatens border security shutdown, GOP cool to idea. Story selection tends to favor the left through both wording and bias by omission where they under report some news stories that are favorable to the right. NBC always sources their information to credible sources that are either low biased or high for factual reporting.
