Great Lakes Formation
The Great Lakes have not always looked the way they do today. In fact if you were to go back in time and visit Michigan 14,000 years ago, you would have found the Great Lakes area covered in a sheet of ice, called a glacier, that averaged over one kilometer thick. At rates of only a few centimeters per day, the glacier slowly made its way across the Great Lakes basin. It carved out deep valleys and moved large amounts of soil. As the glacier melted and moved towards Canada, it left behind a series of large holes that filled with meltwater from the glacier. These formed the basic shape of the Great Lakes. It wasn't until 6,000 years ago that the lakes took their final shape we see today.
