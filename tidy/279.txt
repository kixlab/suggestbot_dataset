Home Pregnancy Tests: How & When To Take Them
A pregnancy test may let you know if you are pregnant. Here are answers to some of the most common questions about pregnancy tests.

What is a pregnancy test, and how does it work? Pregnancy tests are designed to tell if your urine or blood contains a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone is made right after a fertilized egg attaches to the wall of a woman's uterus. This usually happens -- but not always -- about 6 days after fertilization. If you're pregnant, levels of hCG continue to rise rapidly, doubling every 2 to 3 days.

What types of pregnancy tests are available? Two main types of pregnancy tests can let you know if you're pregnant: urine tests and blood tests. Urine tests can be done at home or in a doctor's office. Some home pregnancy tests can detect hCG the day of your missed period. Home pregnancy tests are private and convenient. These products come with instructions. Follow them closely for the most accurate results. After testing, you can confirm results by seeing your doctor, who can perform even more sensitive pregnancy tests. Blood tests are done at your doctor's office, but are used less often than urine tests. These tests can detect pregnancy earlier than a home pregnancy test, or about 6 to 8 days after ovulation. But with these tests, it takes longer to get the results than with a home pregnancy test.
