Difference between “novel” and “fiction”
"Fiction" refers to any made-up story, anything presented as not being true but purely for entertainment, education, etc.

Within the broad category of fiction, we divide stories up by length. The shortest are "short stories". A "novel" means a book-length story. In between is the "novella": you might fit 3 or 4 novellas into a reasonable-length book. If a story takes more than one book, it becomes a "series". If there are exactly three books in the series, it's called a "trilogy". (I'm not aware of specific names for a series with four or five books or any number but three. I'm not sure why that gets a specific name.)

Sometimes people attach specific word-counts to these names. Like they will say that a novel is a story of 40,000 words or more, a novella is 20,000 to 40,000 words, and anything shorter is a short story. As far as I know there's no standard in the publishing business, though. These are just ballpark numbers.

These terms all imply prose, as opposed to poetry.
