9 ways we know humans triggered climate change
Most Americans recognize climate change, but some are still unsure about its causes.

Tens of thousands of scientists in more than a hundred nations have amassed an overwhelming amount of evidence pointing to a clear conclusion: Humans are the main cause.

We're the ones who burn fossil fuels and clear trees that absorb carbon dioxide, sending heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.

It's like the smoking-cancer link

No one questions the link between smoking and cancer, because the science was settled in the 1960s after more than 50 years of research.

We can think of the state of human activities and climate change as no different than smoking and cancer.

In fact, we are as confident that humans cause climate change than that smoking causes cancer.

Scientists are more confident than ever that humans are causing global warming. Ilissa Ocko, Climate Scientist

So what's the evidence?

The research falls into nine independently studied, but physically related, lines of evidence:
