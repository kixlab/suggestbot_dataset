Clients who self-medicate with marijuana : psychotherapy
With marijuana becoming legalized and increasingly normalized in America, I've noticed an increase in clients who admit to regularly using marijuana to self-medicate for a variety of problems (pain, sleep, anxiety, depression, etc). I'm finding it difficult to formulate a solid opinion on this issue and how to address it with clients. On the one hand, marijuana is a drug that poses some risk of addiction. Self-medication, particularly with mental illness, is always a red flag. There are some risks of interactions with medications. And of course, it's still illegal in most states.

On the other hand, there is growing evidence that marijuana does have medicinal properties for a variety of problems. Its risk profile for most people is quite low; given the epidemic of addiction to prescription opioids and benzos, using marijuana to manage pain might actually be the safer option. Unless the client is exhibiting signs of abusing or becoming dependent on marijuana, it doesn't seem that it is objectively more harmful than having a glass of wine or taking a sleeping pill before bed.

This leaves me very ambivalent about how to approach this issue: if a client regularly uses marijuana to self-medicate pain/sleep/mood issues, reports feeling that it has been beneficial, and does not report problems stemming from its use, is this something that I should still be concerned about? Or might this be a "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" kind of situation?
