Determining the Legal Rights of Slaves
Q. I recently read the memoirs of a woman who fled the French Revolution, settled for a while in New York State and wrote of what slavery was like there. She said the slaves had rights: For example, if they thought their owner was treating them unfairly, they had the right to demand that they be sold to someone else. Is this true? Did slaves have legal rights in New York?

A. It depends on the era, Eric Foner, professor of history at Columbia and an authority on American race relations, said in an email. “In the Dutch period, slaves had several such rights,” he said. “The British tended to tighten the system.” According to The Encyclopedia of New York City, the Dutch administration in New Amsterdam allowed slaves to be married in church, but a year after the British took over, the Laws of 1665, the first legal code in the colony, no longer recognized those marriages as legal. In the 18th century, the encyclopedia said, “slaves did have a few rights; for instance, people who willfully killed or maimed slaves were punishable under a law passed in 1686, but the purpose of most laws was to control rather than to protect slaves.”
