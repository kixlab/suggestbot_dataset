Abortion is murder
No matter how one looks at it, abortion is murder.

The science of embryology states that from the moment of conception, a human being is formed. The DNA it has is not only human DNA but the DNA of an individual distinct from that of either parent. In forensic criminology DNA is used to distinguish one person from another. So the DNA of an embryo indicates that the embryo is a person.

To aid a person who engages in abortion or promotes abortion makes one an accessory to murder.

What has been said above is science, not faith. Anyone who says that he personally opposes abortion but will not publicly oppose it because he does not want to impose his faith on others is talking nonsense. It is a matter of science, not faith.

Our faith teaches us that murder is a grave sin and that one who approves of anyoneâ€™s murder and promotes murder also commits a grave sin.

We now have politicians who approve of and support abortion, the murder of the defenseless child. How can we say that voting for such politicians is not grave sin? We need to keep all this in mind when we come to vote in November.
