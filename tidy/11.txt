Fetal Development


First Trimester of Pregnancy [4]

( Less than14 weeks 0 days)

Weeks 1 and 2 of Pregnancy

During the first two weeks after the last menstrual period egg follicles mature in the ovaries under the stimulus of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland in the brain. High levels of the hormone estradiol, produced by the developing egg follicle, cause secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) ,yet another hormone from the pituitary gland. LH causes release of the egg from its follicle (ovulation) For women with 28-day cycles, ovulation usually occurs on days 13 to 15.



Gestational Age 3 weeks . Embryonic Age 1 week .

During the third week, if fertilization occurs , the fertilized egg (called a zygote) will begin producing the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (the pregnancy hormone)

Human chorionic gonadotropin first becomes detectable in the mother's blood and urine between 6 and 14 days after fertilization (3 to 4 weeks gestational age).

During the 3rd week the sex of the fetus is determined by the father's sperm, and twins may be formed.

Fatigue and swollen or tender breasts are sometimes the first signs of pregnancy.



Gestational Age 4 weeks ( 0.9 months) . Embryonic Age 2 weeks

The embryo is the size of a pinhead.

Most pregnancy tests will be positive at this time .



Gestational Age 5 weeks (1.2 months) . Embryonic Age 3 weeks

The brain, spine, and heart have begun to form. By the end of the week the heart will be pumping blood.

Week 5 is the beginning of the embryonic period which lasts from the the 5th to the 10th week.

It is during this critical period that many birth defects occur in the developing embryo.

Most of these birth defects will have no known cause or be due to a combination of factors (multifactorial).



Gestational Age 6 weeks (1.4 months) . Embryonic Age 4 weeks

The embryo is now about the size of a pea.

The average crown to rump length is about 0.2 inches (0.4 cm)

The eyes, nostrils , and arms are taking shape.

The heart is beating at about 110 beats per minute and sometimes may be seen using a transvaginal ultrasound at this time.



Gestational Age 7 weeks (1.6 months) . Embryonic Age 5 weeks

The embryo is now about 0. 4 inches (1 cm ) long.

This week the hands and feet are forming as well as the mouth and face.

The heart is beating at about 120 beats per minute. Movement of the embryo can be detected by ultrasound.

By week 7 the trachea and bronchi of the lungs have formed , and the pseudoglandular stage of lung development begins [17]

Crownâ€“rump length of 7 mm or greater and no heartbeat, or

mean sac diameter of 25 mm or greater and no embryo is considered consistent with early pregnancy loss [20]

In a process is called physiological gut herniation , the intestine elongates and moves outside of the abdomen herniating into the base of the umbilical cord and rotate counter-clockwise at about 8 weeks . The intestine returns into the fetal abdomen by about 12 weeks [18] .

The fetal bladder can be consistently seen using ultrasound after 13 weeks [24].
