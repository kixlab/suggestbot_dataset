24 Tips For Getting Stoned Like A Pro In Amsterdam

It’s legal to buy marijuana at coffeeshops in Amsterdam, and there are literally hundreds of them throughout the city. Trust me, you’ll have no problem finding weed in Amsterdam! Just make sure that you go to a “coffeeshop.” Not a “coffee shop,” “café,” or “coffee house.” Cafés are usually the equivalent of a bar, and coffee shops not selling marijuana are called koffiehuis (which translates to coffee house in English).

Technically, the coffeeshops themselves operate in a bit of a legal gray area, as the suppliers they get the cannabis from aren’t supposed to be growing or selling marijuana. It’s a technicality that goes unnoticed, though, as there's weed aplenty!
