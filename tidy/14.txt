An Overview of Abortion Laws
▼ Permanently enjoined; law not in effect.

* Exception in case of threat to the woman's physical health.

† Exception in case of rape or incest.

‡ Exception in case of life endangerment only. A 2016 New York Attorney General opinion determined that the state’s law conflicts with U.S. Supreme Court rulings on abortion, and that abortion care is permissible under the U.S. Constitution to protect a woman’s health, or when the fetus is not viable.

Ω Exception in case of fetal abnormality.

ξ Only applies to surgical abortion. In New Mexico, some but not all advanced practice clinicians may provide medication abortion.

Ф Law limits abortion provision to OB/GYNs. € A court has temporarily blocked enforcement of a Mississippi law that would have banned abortion at 15 weeks after the patient’s last menstrual period.
