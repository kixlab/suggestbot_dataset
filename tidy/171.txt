When Do Newborns Recognize Their Parents' Voices?
Your baby hears your voice best partially because he's closest to you physically. He hears your voice not only as ambient sound but also experiences it internally through the vibration of your vocal cords. In a Canadian study published in the May 2003 issue of "Psychological Science," fetal heart rate increased in response to a fetus's own mother's voice and decreased when the fetus heard another mother's voice. This effect appears to increase as your due date comes closer, found another Canadian study published in the March 2011 issue of "Developmental Science." In this study, 46 percent of fetuses responded to their mother's voice at 32 to 34 weeks, increasing to 83 percent at term.
