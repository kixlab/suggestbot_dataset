Abortion Statistics

Current United States Data*

Total number of abortions in the U.S. 1973-2013: 56.5 million+

219 abortions per 1,000 live births (according to the Centers for Disease Control)

Abortions per year: 1.058 million

Abortions per day: 2,899

Abortions per hour: 120

1 abortion every 30 seconds

These statistics include only surgical and medical abortions. Because many contraceptive measures are abortifacients (drugs that induce or cause abortions), it is important not to overlook the number of children killed by chemical abortions. Since 1965, an average of 11 million women has used abortifacient methods of birth control in the United States at any given time. Using formulas based on the way the birth control pill works, pharmacy experts project that about 14 million chemical abortions occur in the United States each year, providing a projected total of well in excess of 610 million chemical abortions between 1965 and 2009.

When conducting research on abortion statistics, you may also encounter two different sets of numbers. One set is from the Centers for Disease Control and the other is from the Guttmacher Institute, the “independent research arm” of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

The Guttmacher Institute totals are actually the more accurate since the Institute conducts private research on abortion providers throughout the country and because not all states are required to report to the CDC. In fact, California and New York, where high numbers of abortions occur, are not included in CDC figures.
