Is our DNA living or non-living? Why?
Depends. We cannot completely say DNA is non-living. If it is made up of nucleotides, sugars, phosphates and hydrogen bonds, but look around what are humans made of elements like carbon , hydrogen and oxygen, nitrogen, iron, sulphur etc the list is endless if you are going to the molecular level of it. Go through evolution, how the cell came into being on this earth. it was made by molecules, then nucleic acids made RNA and then we had the first anaerobic heterotroph after that through evolution DNA came.

DNA we cannot clearly specify as only non-living. Consider Viruses for a change. Why canâ€™t we call viruses non-living?

because it consist of DNA or RNA that keeps it in the category of living too apart from non-living category. At the end we humans or all organisms are made of molecules but only difference is we can walk, talk, feel, etc. Reproduce too but then again DNA produce other DNA by replication (semi-conservative method) . DNA is a reason of our being. Yes it is born from nucleic acids, nucleic acids produced from nucleotides, phosphate, these are then form from elements and so on.

This debate can go on without a solution. So just consider DNA as a hereditary material and stop wondering whether it is living or non living. For further understanding read about fibonacci numbers, golden ratio.

all living things has come from molecules (so called non-living if you see the evolutionary aspect of it) then you can consider DNA as non living.
