PG&E signs up for 230MW from proposed solar project
Pacific Gas & Electric, a California investor-owned that has been a voracious purchaser of solar, announced a contract for 230 megawatts of power from the project, slated for 2,100 acres of unused farmland about 80 kilometres north of Los Angeles.

NextLight submitted a zoning application in March and county planners held an initial public meeting last month on environmental issues at the site, which is near the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve. Local topography screens the proposed project from the reserve and an environmental group associated with the reserve has told a local newspaper it is not opposing the development.

NextLight intends to install single-axis tracking solar photovoltaic panels beginning in October 2010, according to its schedule. The project would come online in 2011 and be fully operational by the end of 2013.

The developer is a subsidiary of private equity firm Energy Capital Partners (ECP), which closed its debut fund in late 2006 with $2.25 billion dedicated to investments in conventional and renewable generation, transmission and storage. NextLight is pursuing several utility-scale solar developments in the western US, though it says it’s also open to other renewable energy technologies.

Among ECP’s other investments is a minority stake in thin-film solar panel manufacturer Nanosolar.
