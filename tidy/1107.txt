Where is all the marijuana tax money going?
Listeners wrote in, asking where the state’s weed money goes. Reporter Anna Boiko-Weyrauch of our SoundQs team explains.

We start with $360 million. That’s how much the state expects to get this fiscal year from taxes and fees from marijuana sales.

64 percent: The biggest portion goes to health care costs for low-income people.

This money goes to Medicaid and community clinics — for doctor’s appointments, kids dental care, hospital visits, medication.

33 percent: This goes into the state’s general fund. This is the state’s all-purpose bank account and most of it pays for education — kindergarten through college. The general fund is a grab bag, though, from nursing homes, to habitat conservation to buying computers for government agencies.

8 percent: This goes to prevent drug and alcohol addiction.
