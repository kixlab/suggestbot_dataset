After the revolution, Portugal gave up its colonies, and colonists and soldiers returned to the country with a variety of drugs. Borders opened up and travel and exchange were made far easier. Located on the westernmost tip of the continent, the country was a natural gateway for trafficking across the continent. Drug use became part of the culture of liberation, and the use of hard narcotics became popular. Eventually, it got out of hand, and drug use became a crisis.</p><p>At first, the government responded to it as the United States is all too familiar with: a conservative cultural backlash that vilified drug use and a harsh, punitive set of policies led by the criminal justice system. Throughout the 1980s, Portugal tried this approach, but to no avail: By 1999, nearly 1% of the population was addicted to heroin, and drug-related AIDS deaths in the country were the highest in the European Union, according to the<em><a class href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/17/getting-a-fix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> New Yorker</a></em><em>.</em></p><p>But by 2001, the country decided to decriminalize possession and use of drugs, and the results have been remarkable.</p><p><b>What's gotten better? </b>In terms of usage rate and health, the data show that Portugal has by no means plunged into a drug crisis.</p><p>As this chart from <a class href="http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blog/success-portugal%E2%80%99s-decriminalisation-policy-%E2%80%93-seven-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transform Drug Policy Foundation</a> shows, the proportion of the population that reports having used drugs at some point saw an initial increase after decriminalization, but then a decline: </p><figure class="gb"><div class="gc" style="padding-top:54.785%"><div class="hf"><noscript><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/mic/syi3ectq1hizrb51ytabiqvs61r5hfa5pmidkxrf72m5glzvve5rt2psuxooiln4.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70" srcSet="https://imgix.bustle.com/mic/syi3ectq1hizrb51ytabiqvs61r5hfa5pmidkxrf72m5glzvve5rt2psuxooiln4.jpg?w=349&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70 349w, https://imgix.bustle.com/mic/syi3ectq1hizrb51ytabiqvs61r5hfa5pmidkxrf72m5glzvve5rt2psuxooiln4.jpg?w=349&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70&amp;dpr=2 698w, https://imgix.bustle.com/mic/syi3ectq1hizrb51ytabiqvs61r5hfa5pmidkxrf72m5glzvve5rt2psuxooiln4.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70 646w, https://imgix.bustle.com/mic/syi3ectq1hizrb51ytabiqvs61r5hfa5pmidkxrf72m5glzvve5rt2psuxooiln4.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70&amp;dpr=2 1292w" sizes="(min-width:768px) 646px, 349px" alt class="hg" /></noscript></div></div><cite class="fY">Source: Transform Drug Policy Foundation</cite></figure><p>(Lifetime prevalence means the percentage of people who report having used a drug at some point in their life, past-year prevalence indicates having used within the last year, and past-month prevalence means those who've used within the last month.
