At the first glance, this does not look like a major reduction. However one should keep in mind that the <a href="/growing-world-population" title="Growing world population (by country until 2050)">world population will grow</a>  from 6.4 billion people in 2007 to about 9.5 billion people in 2050.

    <h3><a href="/CO2-cause-of-global-warming#comment-192" class="active">Water vapor is the most important NATURAL greenhouse gas</a></h3>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
Water vapor is indeed the most important <i>naturally occurring</i> greenhouse gas. The major natural greenhouse gases are water vapor, which causes about 36-70% of the greenhouse effect on Earth (not including clouds); carbon dioxide CO2, which causes 9-26%; methane, which causes 4-9%, and ozone, which causes 3-7%. It is not possible to state that a certain gas causes a certain percentage of the greenhouse effect, because the influences of the various gases are not additive. Other greenhouse gases include, but are not limited to, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons.<br />
</p>
<p>
But <b>the fact that water vapor is the most important gas in creating the natural greenhouse effect does not mean man-made greenhouse gases have no effect!</b>
</p>
<p>
Since we cannot influence the naturally occurring greenhouse gases, we normally concentrate on the man-made greenhouse gases (many times without specifically mentioning). Sometimes they are called &quot;emitted greenhouse gases&quot;. I understand that this can be confusing. 
</p>
<h3><a href="/cause-and-effect-for-global-warming" title="Article about cause and effects of global warming (climate change)">Cause and effect of global warming</a></h3>
<p>
Increasing amounts of man-made greenhouse gases lead to an increase in the surface temperature on Earth. This temperature increase causes other effects, one of them being the increase of the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. Although human activities do not directly add significant amounts of water vapor to the atmosphere, warmer air can contain more water vapor. Because water vapor is a greenhouse gas (as you mentioned), global warming will be further enhanced by the increased amounts of water vapor. This is called a positive feedback. 
</p>
<p>
In other words: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The current global warming is caused by man-made greenhouse gases (mainly CO2, NOx and Methane). </li>
	<li>Global warming leads to a higher temperature on Earth.</li>
	<li>Due to the higher temperature, the air does contain more water vapor.</li>
	<li>This additional water vapor (a greenhouse gas) does again increase the effect of global warming (a positive feedback or secondary effect).</li>
</ol>

    <h3><a href="/CO2-cause-of-global-warming#comment-196" class="active">The cause for the current global warming is a different one</a></h3>

    <div class="content">
      The Earth has indeed already had warming periods for several times, as you mentioned. However there is not just one single way to initiate a global warming period. <i>Who is saying that all global warming periods have been caused by the same effect?</i>
<p>
So earlier warming periods may easily have been caused by different effects than the current one. In fact, most of the earlier global warming periods have been caused by a change in the sun's radiation. In that particular case it is normal that the CO2 concentration lags behind the warming because it is a secondary effect and not the cause.
</p>
<p>
The current global warming however is caused by man-made emissions of greenhouse gases. It is meanwhile well proven not to be a natural cycle.  
</p>

You can fracture your leg with skiing, but you can also fracture your leg if you fall down the stairs. If you fractured your leg already two times with skiing, this is no proof that in the third case it was caused by skiing as well. Maybe you have had a car accident or anything else.

<p>
It is similar with the cause of global warming: <b>The cause for earlier warming periods can be (and indeed are) different from the current one.</b>

Compared to the water vapor which is already in the atmosphere, the additional water vapor generated by hydrogen-powered cars would have very little influence.

You need to look at the yearly average temperature. Just to take one month and then draw conclusions is not appropriate. All in all, the wheather is getting more extreme, so we will have much wormer and much colder days, weeks and months in a year. We will have periodes with extremely high precipitations and periodes with aridity. The same is true for storms, tornados, etc.
</p>
<p>
What you see in the graph above is the yearly average temperature of the world (not just in the place where you are living). And this yearly average temperature of the world has been increasing.

      <p>
You are WRONG when you say
</p>
<p>
&quot;We are releasing more water vapor than CO2&quot;.
</p>
<p>
For example, let's look at burning diesel fuel. Burning fuel is called an <b>oxidation process</b>. To make it simple, we assume C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>26</sub> as chemical formula for diesel fuel. Then the following chemical reaction takes place:
</p>
<p>
2 C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>   +   37 O<sub>2</sub>    →   26  H<sub>2</sub>O   +    24  CO<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>
This means: for each kg of diesel fuel burnt, 1.38 kg water vapor and 3.106 kg CO2 is produced. So the oxidation of diesel fuel creates more than two times as much carbon dioxide (CO2) as water vapor. The relation for other fossil fuels is similar (but not exactly the same).

I am certainly not denying the effect of water for the (natural) greenhouse effect. However, if you took 12'000 molecules of air, you would normally find just 3 molecules of CO2 but 600 molecules of water. So if you add 26 more water molecules to 600, the relative change is quite little compared to adding 24 carbon dioxide molecules to the existing 3 CO2 molecules.
</p>
<p>
However, it is not just the number of molecules as you seem to suggest: the strength of greenhouse effect of the different contributors also needs to be taken into account. With increasing height, the concentration of water vapor drops significantly, where the concentration of other greenhouse gases like CO2 or Methane remain more or less constant with increasing height above ground. Because it is colder up there, greenhouse gases are much more effective with increasing height above ground.  
</p>
<p>
Water vapor and clouds account for about 65 to 85% of the natural greenhouse effect (natural means without human acitivities). <b>The remaining 15 to 35% of the <i>natural</i> greenhouse effect are caused by very small concentrations of the other greenhouse gases (CO2, NOx, Methane, etc.)</b>. This explains why relatively small quantities of CO2 and other non-water greenhouse gases can have a major effect on the climate.
</p>
<p>
Human beings have been increasing the amount of non-water vapor greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (mainly due to burning fossile fuels, cattle breeding, etc.). This causes the temperature to rise. In addition, an increased temperature causes more water to water to evaporate into the atmosphere, which does in turn increase the warming effect.

The air is a mixture of different compounds, usually about 21% oxygen (O2) and about 78% nitrogen (N2). We have this mixture although nitrogen is lighter than oxygen. So the same question can be asked for nitrogen and oxygen in the air.
</p>
<p>
The anwser is: Air is a so-called meta-stable gas mixture, the concentrations remain constant up to a height of about 100 kilometers. The air is constantly agitated (e.g. by winds) which helps to keep it
well mixed and to lower existing differences in concentration.
</p>
<p>
<b>Emission of CO: </b>
</p>
<p>
A modern vehicle should not emit much CO because CO is a sign of a bad (incomplete) burning process. Usually because oxygen was missing. The catalyst in the vehicle should convert CO into CO2. 
</p>
<p>
CO is dangerous for human beings and for plants. Just mixing it with oxygen is not enough to transform it into CO2, it needs further activation (catalyst, sun light, etc.)
