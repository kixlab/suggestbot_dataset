<h2><a id="start" name="start">I</a>mpact of Drugs on Society</h2>
<p>The trafficking and abuse of drugs in the United States affect nearly all aspects 
of our lives. The economic cost alone is immense, estimated at nearly $215 billion. 
The damage caused by drug abuse and addiction is reflected in an overburdened justice 
system, a strained healthcare system, lost productivity, and environmental destruction.</p>
<h3><a id="Demand" name="Demand">The</a> Demand for Illicit Drugs</h3>
<p>NSDUH data show that in 2008, 14.2 percent of individuals 12 years of age and 
older had used illicit drugs during the past year. Marijuana is the most commonly 
used illicit drug, with 25.8 million individuals 12 years of age and older (10.3%) 
reporting past year use. That rate remains stable from the previous year (10.1%) 
(see <a href="app-b.htm#TableB1" alt="Link to Table B1 in Appendix B.">Table B1</a> 
in Appendix B). <a name="text4" id="text4">Psychotherapeutic</a>s<span class="footnote"><a href="#foot4" alt="See footnote.">4</a></span> 
ranked second, with 15.2 million individuals reporting past year &quot;nonmedical use&quot; 
in 2008, a decrease from 16.3 million in 2007. In 2008, approximately 5.3 million 
individuals aged 12 and older reported past year cocaine use, 850,000 reported past 
year methamphetamine use, and 453,000 reported past year heroin use.</p>
<p>Rates of drug use vary by age. Rates are highest for young adults aged 18 to 
25, with 33.5 percent reporting illicit drug use in the past year. Nineteen percent 
of youth aged 12 to 17 report past year illicit drug use. Finally, 10.3 percent 
of adults aged 26 and older report past year illicit drug use. These rates are relatively 
stable when compared with 2007 rates.</p>
<p>In 2008, approximately 2.9 million individuals tried an illicit drug or used 
a prescription drug nonmedically for the first time, representing nearly 8,000 initiates 
per day. More than half of these new users (56.6%) report that marijuana was the 
first illicit substance that they had tried. Other past year illicit drug initiates 
report that their first drug was a psychotherapeutic drug used nonmedically (29.6%), 
an inhalant (9.7%), or a hallucinogen (3.2%). By drug category, marijuana and pain 
relievers used nonmedically each had an estimated 2.2 million past year first-time 
users. Also identified frequently as the first drug used by initiates were tranquilizers 
(nonmedical use--1.1 million), ecstasy/MDMA (0.9 million), inhalants (0.7 million), 
cocaine (0.7 million), and stimulants (0.6 million). Methamphetamine appears to 
be fading in popularity among initiates. In 2008, an estimated 95,000 individuals 
tried methamphetamine for the first time--a 39 percent decrease from the 2007 estimate 
(157,000) and a 70 percent decrease from the 2004 estimate (318,000).</p>

<h3><a name="Consequences" id="Consequences">The</a> Consequences of Illicit Drug 
Use</h3>
<p>The consequences of illicit drug use are widespread, causing permanent physical 
and emotional damage to users and negatively impacting their families, coworkers, 
and many others with whom they have contact. Drug use negatively impacts a user's 
health, often leading to sickness and disease. In many cases, users die prematurely 
from drug overdoses or other drug-associated illnesses (see
<a href="#textbox1" alt="See text box.">text box</a>). Some users are parents, whose 
deaths leave their children in the care of relatives or in foster care. Drug law 
violations constitute a substantial proportion of incarcerations in local, state, 
and federal facilities and represent the most common arrest category.</p>

		<p class="titletextbox"><a name="textbox1" id="textbox1">Colombian</a> Cocaine 
		Producers Increase Use of a Harmful Cutting Agent</p>
		<p>Since late 2007, cocaine has increasingly contained levamisole, a pharmaceutical 
		agent that typically is used for livestock deworming. According to Drug 
		Enforcement Administration (DEA) Cocaine Signature Program data, before 
		2008, less than 10 percent of the tested wholesale-level cocaine samples 
		contained levamisole. By 2009, approximately 71 percent of the tested cocaine 
		samples contained levamisole. Because levamisole is being found in kilogram 
		quantities of cocaine, investigators are confident that Colombian traffickers 
		are adding it as part of the production process, possibly to enhance the 
		effects of the cocaine. However, levamisole can be hazardous to humans, 
		especially those with weakened immune systems. Ingesting levamisole can 
		cause a person to develop agranulocytosis, a serious, sometimes fatal, blood 
		disorder. At least 20 confirmed and probable cases of agranulocytosis, including 
		two deaths, have been associated with cocaine adulterated with levamisole. 
		The consequences of abusing levamisole are serious enough that in September 
		2009, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) 
		issued a nationwide public alert on its effects.</p>

<h3><a name="Health" id="Health">Impact</a> on Health and Health Care Systems</h3>
<p>Drug use and abuse may lead to specialized treatment, ED visits (sometimes involving 
death), contraction of illnesses, and prolonged hospital stays.</p>
<p>In 2008, NSDUH estimated that 7 million individuals aged 12 and older were dependent 
on or had abused illicit drugs in the past year, compared with 6.9 million in 2007. 
The drugs with the highest dependence or abuse levels were marijuana, prescription 
pain relievers, and cocaine. The number of individuals reporting past year marijuana 
abuse or dependence was 4.2 million in 2008, compared with 3.9 million in 2007; 
the number of individuals reporting past year prescription pain reliever abuse or 
dependence was 1.7 million in both 2007 and 2008; and the number of individuals 
reporting past year cocaine abuse or dependence was 1.4 million in 2008, compared 
with 1.6 million in 2007.</p>
<p>Many individuals who become dependent on illicit drugs eventually seek treatment. 
The Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) provides information regarding the demographics 
and substance abuse patterns of treatment admissions to state-licensed treatment 
facilities for drug dependence. In 2007, there were approximately 1.8 million admissions 
to state-licensed treatment facilities for illicit drug dependence or abuse. The 
highest percentage of admissions reported opiates as the primary drug of choice 
(31%, primarily heroin) followed by marijuana/hashish (27%), cocaine (22%), and 
stimulants (13%). Although approaches to treatment vary by drug, more than half 
of the admissions were to ambulatory (outpatient, intensive outpatient, and detox) 
facilities rather than residential facilities. (See
<a href="app-b.htm#TableB2" alt="Link to Table B2 in Appendix B.">Table B2</a> in 
Appendix B for data on admissions for specific drugs.)</p>
<p>Individuals often experience adverse reactions to drugs--including nonfatal overdoses--that 
require them to go to the hospital. In 2006, the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) 
reported that of 113 million hospital ED visits--1,742,887 (1.5%)--were related 
to drug misuse or drug abuse. An estimated 31 percent of these visits involved illicit 
drugs only, 28 percent involved CPDs, and 13 percent involved illicit drugs in combination 
with alcohol. When drug misuse or abuse plays a role in these ED visits, the most 
commonly reported substances are cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and stimulants (typically 
amphetamines or methamphetamine).</p>
<p>A 2007 DAWN survey of 63 metropolitan areas found an average of 12.1 deaths per 
100,000 persons related to drug <a name="text5" id="text5">use</a>.<span class="footnote"><a href="#foot5" alt="See footnote.">5</a></span> 
Rates of drug-related deaths range from 1.1 per 100,000 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, 
to 26.1 per 100,000 in the New Orleans area. DAWN also records the number of drug-related 
suicide deaths. In 2007, the number of drug-related suicides per 100,000 persons 
ranged from less than one in several jurisdictions (including Chicago, Dallas-Fort 
Worth, and Minneapolis) to 6.2 per 100,000 in Fargo, North Dakota. To put these 
statistics in perspective, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
reports other nonnatural death rates as follows: Motor vehicle accidents, 15.1 per 
100,000; nontransport accidents (e.g., falls, accidental drownings), 24.4 per 100,000; 
suicide, 11.1 per 100,000; and homicides, 6.2 per 100,000.</p>
<p>The consequences of drug use usually are not limited to the user and often extend 
to the user's family and the greater community. According to SAMHSA, combined data 
from 2002 to 2007 indicate that during the prior year, an estimated 2.1 million 
American children (3%) lived with at least one parent who was dependent on or abused 
illicit drugs, and 1 in 10 children under 18 lived with a substance-addicted or 
substance-abusing <a name="text6" id="text6">parent</a>.<span class="footnote"><a href="#foot6" alt="See footnote.">6</a></span> 
Moreover, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimated in 1999 that 
substance abuse was a factor in two-thirds of all foster care placements.</p>
<p>Many states have enacted drug-endangered children laws to protect children from 
the consequences of drug production, trafficking, and abuse. Typically associated 
with methamphetamine production, drug-endangered children are exposed not only to 
abuse and neglect but also to fires, explosions, and physical health hazards such 
as toxic chemicals. In 2009, 980 children were reported to the El Paso Intelligence 
Center (EPIC) as present at or affected by methamphetamine laboratories, including 
8 who were injured and 2 who were killed at the laboratories. These statistics do 
not include children killed by random gunfire associated with drug activity or who 
were physically or sexually abused by a &quot;caretaker&quot; involved in drug trafficking 
or under the influence of drugs.</p>

<h3><a name="Crime" id="Crime">Impact</a> on Crime and Criminal Justice Systems</h3>
<p>The consequences of illicit drug use impact the entire criminal justice system, 
taxing resources at each stage of the arrest, adjudication, incarceration, and post-release 
supervision process. Although drug courts and diversion programs in many jurisdictions 
have helped to alleviate this burden (see
<a href="#textbox2" alt="See text box.">text box</a>), substance abuse within the 
criminal justice population remains widespread.</p>
<table id="textbox2" cellspacing="0" class="textbox">

		<p class="titletextbox"><a name="textbox2" id="textbox2">Drug</a> Courts</p>
		<p>To alleviate the burden that drug use and abuse have caused to the nation's 
		criminal justice system, most jurisdictions have developed drug courts or 
		other diversion programs aimed at breaking the drug addiction and crime 
		cycle. In these nonadversarial, coordinated approaches to processing drug 
		cases, participants receive a full continuum of treatment services, are 
		subject to frequent urinalyses, and experience strict judicial monitoring 
		in lieu of traditional incarceration. Once the offender successfully completes 
		treatment, charges may be dropped.</p>
		<p>Since the first drug court became operational in Miami in 1989, the number 
		of drug courts has grown each year, and such courts now exist in all 50 
		states as well as the District of Columbia, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto 
		Rico, and Indian Country. As of July 2009, there were 2,038 active drug 
		court programs and 226 in the planning stages. Research has shown that drug 
		courts are associated with reduced recidivism by participants and result 
		in cost savings. For instance, a 2006 study of nine California drug courts 
		showed that drug court graduates had recidivism rates of 17 percent, while 
		a comparison group who did not participate in drug court had recidivism 
		rates of 41 percent. A study of the drug court in Portland, Oregon, found 
		that the program reduced crime by 30 percent over 5 years and saved the 
		county more than $79 million over 10 years. With success stories abundant, 
		drug courts have gained approval at the local, state, and federal levels.</p>

<p>The most recent annual data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) show 
that 12.2 percent of more than 14 million arrests in 2008 were for drug violations, 
the most common arrest crime category. The proportion of total drug arrests has 
increased over the past 20 years: in 1987, only 7.4 percent of all arrests were 
for drug violations. Approximately 4 percent of all homicides in 2008 were drug-related, 
a percentage that has not changed significantly over the same 20-year period.</p>
<p>The characteristics of populations under correctional supervision reflect these 
arrest patterns. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), 20 percent 
of state prisoners and 53 percent of federal prisoners are incarcerated because 
of a drug offense. Moreover, 27 percent of individuals on probation and 37 percent 
of individuals on parole at the end of 2007 had committed a drug offense.</p>
<p>The drug-crime link is also reflected in arrestee data. In 2008, the Arrestee 
Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) II program found that the median percentage of male 
arrestees who tested positive in the 10 ADAM II cities for any of 10 drugs, including 
cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, opioids, and phencyclidine (PCP), was 67.6 
percent, down slightly from 69.2 percent in 2007. Other data reflect the link as 
well. In 2002, a BJS survey found that 68 percent of jail inmates were dependent 
on or abusing drugs and alcohol and that 55 percent had used illicit drugs during 
the month before their offense. In 2004, a similar BJS self-report survey identified 
the drug-crime link more precisely: 17 percent of state prisoners and 18 percent 
of federal prisoners had committed their most recent offense to acquire money to 
buy drugs. Property and drug offenders were more likely than violent and public-order 
offenders to commit crimes for drug money.</p>
<p class="textcenter"><a alt="Link to top of page." href="#Top">To Top</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a alt="Link to table of contents." href="index.htm#Contents">To Contents</a></p>
<h3><a name="Productivity" id="Productivity">Impact</a> on Productivity</h3>
<p>Premature mortality, illness, injury leading to incapacitation, and imprisonment 
all serve to directly reduce national productivity. Public financial resources expended 
in the areas of health care and criminal justice as a result of illegal drug trafficking 
and use are resources that would otherwise be available for other policy initiatives.</p>
<p>There is a great loss of productivity associated with drug-related premature 
mortality. In 2005, 26,858 deaths were unintentional or undetermined-intent poisonings; 
in 2004, 95 percent of these poisonings were caused by drugs. Although it is difficult 
to place a dollar value on a human life, a rough calculation of lost productivity 
can be made based on the present discounted value of a person's lifetime earnings.</p>
<p>There are also health-related productivity losses. An individual who enters a 
residential drug treatment program or is admitted to a hospital for drug treatment 
becomes incapacitated and is removed from the labor force. According to TEDS data, 
there were approximately 1.8 million admissions to state-licensed treatment facilities 
for illicit drug dependence or abuse in 2007. Productivity losses in this area alone 
are enormous. Health-related productivity losses are higher still when lost productivity 
associated with drug-related hospital admissions (including victims of drug-related 
crimes) is included.</p>
<p>The approximately one-quarter of offenders in state and local correctional facilities 
and the more than half of offenders in federal facilities incarcerated on drug-related 
charges represent an estimated 620,000 individuals who are not in the workforce. 
The cost of their incarceration therefore has two components: keeping them behind 
bars and the results of their nonproductivity while they are there.</p>
<p>Finally, there is productivity lost to drug-related unemployment and drug-related 
absenteeism. According to the 2008 NSDUH, 19.6 percent of unemployed adults may 
be defined as current users of illicit drugs. Based on population estimates from 
the same study, this translates into approximately 1.8 million unemployed individuals 
who were current drug abusers. Further, approximately 8 percent of individuals employed 
full time and 10.2 percent of individuals employed part-time were current users 
of illicit drugs. Individuals who are employed but have chronic absenteeism resulting 
from illicit drug use also accrue substantial lost productivity.</p>
<p class="textcenter"><a alt="Link to top of page." href="#Top">To Top</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a alt="Link to table of contents." href="index.htm#Contents">To Contents</a></p>
<h3><a name="Environment" id="Environment">Impact</a> on the Environment</h3>
<p>The environmental impact of illicit drugs is largely the result of outdoor cannabis 
cultivation and methamphetamine production. Many of the chemicals used to produce 
methamphetamine are flammable, and the improper storage, use, and disposal of such 
chemicals that are typical among methamphetamine producers often lead to fires and 
explosions at clandestine laboratories. Additionally, the process used to produce 
methamphetamine results in toxic chemicals--between 5 and 7 pounds of waste per 
pound of methamphetamine--that are typically discarded improperly in fields, streams, 
forests, and sewer systems, causing extensive environmental damage.</p>
<p>Currently, there are no conclusive estimates regarding the nationwide cost of 
methamphetamine production site remediation because many of the methamphetamine 
laboratories and dumpsites in the United States are undiscovered due to their clandestine 
locations. However, in California alone, from January through December 10, 2009, 
the California Department of Toxic Substance Control responded to and cleaned up 
232 laboratories and dumpsites at a cost of $776,889, or approximately $3,349 per 
site.</p>
<p>Outdoor cannabis cultivation, particularly on public lands, is causing increasing 
environmental damage. Grow site operators often contaminate and alter watersheds, 
clear-cut native vegetation, discard garbage and nonbiodegradable materials at deserted 
sites, create wildfire hazards, and divert natural water courses. For example, cultivators 
often dam streams and redirect the water through plastic gravity-fed irrigation 
tubing to supply water to individual plants. The high demand for water often strains 
small streams and damages downstream vegetation that depend on consistent water 
flow. In addition, law enforcement officials are increasingly encountering dumpsites 
of highly toxic insecticides, chemical repellants, and poisons that are produced 
in Mexico, purchased by Mexican criminal groups, and transported into the country 
for use at their cannabis grow sites. These toxic chemicals enter and contaminate 
ground water, pollute watersheds, kill fish and other wildlife, and eventually enter 
residential water supplies. Moreover, the National Parks Conservation Association 
(NPCA) reports that while preparing land for cannabis cultivation, growers commonly 
clear the forest understory, which allows nonnative plants to supplant native ones, 
adversely affecting the ecosystem. They also terrace the land--especially in mountainous 
areas--which results in rapid erosion.</p>
<p>Limited research on the environmental impact of the improper disposal of
<a name="text7" id="text7">pharmaceutical</a>s<span class="footnote"><a href="#foot7" alt="See footnote.">7</a></span> 
indicates that contamination from dissolved pharmaceutical drugs is present in extremely 
low levels in most of the nation's water supply. The harm to aquatic life and the 
environment has not been determined, and according to the Environmental Protection 
Agency, scientists have found no evidence of adverse human health effects from the
