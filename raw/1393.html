How do you build belief in yourself?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s not an easy answer, but one thing is certainly true: it has to come from inside. One way to instill the right mindset for building self-assurance and confidence is to spend time with thoughts that motivate and inspire us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are 100 inspiring quotes hand-picked for increasing your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.&quot; &lt;em&gt;- Eleanor Roosevelt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;/strong&gt; &quot;I can be changed by what happens to me.

Because one accepts oneself, the whole world accepts him or her.&quot; &lt;em&gt;- Laozi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt; &quot;With realization of one&apos;s own potential and self-confidence in one&apos;s ability, one can build a better world.&quot; &lt;em&gt;- The Dalai Lama&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. &lt;/strong&gt; &quot;If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life.

If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.&quot; &lt;em&gt;- Mahatama Gandhi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Trust yourself--you know more than you think you do.&quot;&lt;em&gt; - Benjamin Spock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you.&quot; &lt;em&gt;- Ralph Waldo Emerson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Accept who you are; and revel in it.&quot; &lt;em&gt;- Mitch Albom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;You wouldn&apos;t worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do.&quot; &lt;em&gt;- Eleanor Roosevelt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Never bend your head.

Discover.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Mark Twain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;53.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Oscar Wilde&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;54.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Buddha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;55.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Action is a great restorer and builder of confidence. Inaction is not only the result, but the cause, of fear. Perhaps the action you take will be successful; perhaps different action or adjustments will have to follow. But any action is better than no action at all.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Norman Vincent Peale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;56. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Ralph Waldo Emerson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;57. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;When you&apos;re different, sometimes you don&apos;t see the millions of people who accept you for what you are. All you notice is the person who doesn&apos;t.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Jodi Picoult&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;58.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;As soon as you trust yourself, you will know how to live.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;59. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;Once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight, or any experience that reveals the human spirit.&quot; &lt;em&gt;--e. e. cummings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;60. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You&apos;re on your own. And you know what you know. You are the guy who&apos;ll decide where to go.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Dr. Seuss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;61. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;I laugh at myself. I don&apos;t take myself completely seriously. I think that&apos;s another quality that people have to hold on to ... you have to laugh, especially at yourself.&quot; &lt;em&gt;―Madonna&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;62. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;Regardless of how you feel inside, always try to look like a winner. Even if you are behind, a sustained look of control and confidence can give you a mental edge that results in victory.&quot;&lt;em&gt; -Diane Arbus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;63.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Learning too soon our limitations, we never learn our powers.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Mignon McLaughlin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;64. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;People who ask confidently get more than those who are hesitant and uncertain. When you&apos;ve figured out what you want to ask for, do it with certainty, boldness and confidence.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Jack Canfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;65.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&quot;It is not so much our friends&apos; help that helps us, as the confidence of their help.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Epicurus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;66. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;Skill and confidence are an unconquered army.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-George Herbert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;67. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;Argue for your limitations, and sure enough they&apos;re yours.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Richard Bach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;68. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;Of all our infirmities, the most savage is to despise our being. &lt;em&gt;-Michel de Montaigne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;69. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;If I have lost confidence in myself, I have the universe against me.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Ralph Waldo &lt;/em&gt;Emerson&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;70.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Nothing splendid has ever been achieved except by those who dared believe that something inside of them was superior to circumstance.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Bruce Barton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;71&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;Once you become self-conscious, there is no end to it; once you start to doubt, there is no room for anything else.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Mignon McLaughlin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;72. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;Anyone who ever gave you confidence, you owe them a lot.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Truman Capote&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;73.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Kindness in words creates confidence.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Laozi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;74. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;Self-confidence is the first requisite to great undertakings.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Samuel Johnson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;75. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;As is our confidence, so is our capacity.&quot;&lt;em&gt;-William Hazlitt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;76.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Never dull your shine for somebody else.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Tyra Banks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;77. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;Control your own destiny or someone else will.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Jack Welch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;78.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Confidence is that feeling by which the mind embarks in great and honorable courses with a sure hope and trust in itself. .&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Cicero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;79.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Confidence is the most important single factor in this game, and no matter how great your natural talent, there is only one way to obtain and sustain it: work.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Jack Nicklaus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;80.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;If once you forfeit the confidence of your fellow citizens, you can never regain their respect and esteem.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Abraham Lincoln&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;81.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Confidence is contagious. So is lack of confidence.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Vince Lombardi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;82.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The greatest mistake you can make in life is continually fearing that you&apos;ll make one.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Elbert Hubbard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;83.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;I quit being afraid when my first venture failed and the sky didn&apos;t fall down.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Al Neuharth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;84.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;It generally happens that assurance keeps an even pace with ability.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Samuel Johnson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;85.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Only the person who has faith in himself is able to be faithful to others.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Erich Fromm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;86.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;One&apos;s self-image is very important because if that&apos;s in good shape, then you can do anything, or practically anything.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-John Gielgud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;87.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Humor comes from self-confidence.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Rita Mae Brown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;88.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The more validation I need, the less discernment I have.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Kurt Hanks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;89.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;We all have our limitations, but when we listen to our critics, we also have theirs.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Robert Breault&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;90.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Edmund Hillary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;91&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;The way to develop self-confidence is to do the thing you fear and get a record of successful experiences behind you.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-William Jennings Bryan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;92&lt;/strong&gt;. &quot;Nurture your mind with great thoughts, for you will never go any higher than you think.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Benjamin Disraeli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;93. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;Love yourself first and everything else falls into line. You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Lucille Ball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;94.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Confidence is directness and courage in meeting the facts of life.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-John Dewey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;95. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;If you don&apos;t ask, the answer is always no.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Nora Roberts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;96.&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;First thing every morning before you arise say out loud, I believe.&quot; &lt;em&gt;-Norman Vincent Peale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;97. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;Until you value yourself, you won&apos;t value your time. Until you value your time, you will not do anything with it. &quot; &lt;em&gt;- M. Scott Peck&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;98. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one&apos;s definition of your life, but define yourself.&quot; &lt;em&gt;- Harvey Fierstein&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Harvey Fierstein&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;99. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to oneself.&quot; &lt;em&gt;― Michel de Montaigne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100. &lt;/strong&gt;&quot;The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely.&quot; &lt;em&gt;― C.G.
