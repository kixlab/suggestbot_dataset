<h1>Current Trends
Premarital Sexual Experience Among Adolescent
Women -- United States, 1970-1988 </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>The initiation of sexual intercourse early in life is
associated with an increased number of sex partners and a greater
risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). This report
describes trends in age at first premarital sexual intercourse
for adolescent women (15-19 years of age) in the United States
during 1970-1988 and indicates an accelerated increase in the
proportion having had premarital sex from 1986 to 1988. </p>
<p>Data for this analysis were obtained from interviews with 8450
women* 15-44 years of age who participated in the National Survey
of Family Growth (NSFG) conducted by CDC's National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) in 1988. The women were part of a
subsample from a nationally representative sample of households
interviewed in the National Health Interview Survey of 1986
(NCHS, unpublished data). The NSFG provided specific information
on age and marital status of participants at first sexual
intercourse, as well as detailed information on other factors,
such as childbearing experiences, use of family-planning
services, and knowledge of and experience with STDs. </p>
<p>Proportions were calculated for adolescent women in each year
of age from 15 through 19 who reported having had premarital
sexual intercourse by March 1 in 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, and
1988.** For all ages combined for each of these periods, the
proportion of adolescent women who reported having had premarital
sexual intercourse increased steadily (from 28.6% in 1970 to
51.5% in 1988 (Table 1)). For each 5-year period from 1970 to
1985, the amount of increase declined (i.e., during 1970-1975,
7.8 percentage points; during 1976-1980, 5.6; and during
1981-1985, 2.1). However, from 1985 through 1988, the proportion
increased 7.4 points, or approximately one third of the increase
in premarital sexual experience among adolescent women for the
entire period 1970-1988. This trend persisted even after
adjustment for the influence of changing age composition by
comparing age-adjusted proportions. </p>
<p>For each year of age during 1970-1988, the proportion of
adolescent women who reported having had premarital sexual
intercourse increased at least 55% (Table 1). The largest
relative increase occurred among those 15 years of age (from 4.6%
in 1970 to 25.6% in 1988). The cumulative absolute effect of
these changes was greatest among women 18 and 19 years of age. </p>
<p>Although the proportion of black adolescents who reported
having had premarital sexual intercourse was consistently higher
than the proportion of white adolescents who reported having had
premarital intercourse, the difference narrowed substantially
over time because of a greater relative increase among white
adolescents (24 percentage points among whites compared with 13
percentage points among blacks) (Figure 1). For white
adolescents, this represents an increase in the number of
sexually experienced females from 2.2 million in 1970 to 3.7
million in 1988, and for black adolescents, from 0.6 million to
0.8 million. </p>
<p>In 1988, adolescents who had had sexual intercourse earlier in
life reported greater numbers of sex partners. Among 15- to
24-year-olds who initiated sexual intercourse before age 18, 75%
reported having had two or more partners, and 45% reported having
had four or more partners; among those who became sexually active
after age 19, 20% reported having had more than one partner, and
1%, four or more partners. Among women aged 15-24 years who had
been sexually active for the same length of time ( less than 24
months), 45% of 15- to 17-year-olds reported having had two or
more partners, compared with 40% of 18- to 19-year-olds and 26%
of those greater than or equal to 20 years of age.
Reported by: Family Growth Survey Br, Div of Vital Statistics,
National Center for Health Statistics; Div of STD/HIV Prevention,
Center for Prevention Svcs, CDC. </p><h3>Editorial Note</h3>
<p>Editorial Note: The NSFG data show that the proportion of
adolescent women who reported having had premarital sexual
intercourse increased through the 1970s and 1980s, and first
sexual experiences occurred at younger ages. Among the 9 million
adolescent women in 1988, almost 4.9 million (52%) may have had
premarital sexual intercourse. </p>
<p>Information on the premarital sexual experience of adolescent
women in the United States was first provided in a series of
National Surveys of Young Women (NSYW) conducted in 1971, 1976,
and 1979 (1). Based on these studies, the proportion of
adolescent women in metropolitan settings experiencing premarital
sexual intercourse increased from 30% in 1971 to 50% by 1979.
This trend was confirmed by the 1982 NSFG, although the increase
was less pronounced (1). The NSFG estimates for 1976 and 1979
were lower than those from the NSYW studies, but the differences
were not statistically significant. </p>
<p>Increased sexual activity among adolescents has several health
consequences. For several reasons, adolescents are at higher risk
for sexually transmitted infection than are persons in other age
groups (2). Compared with older age groups, adolescents have
higher rates of gonorrheal and chlamydial infections (3)
(Chlamydia trachomatis causes more lower genital tract infections
among teenagers than does gonorrhea (4)). In addition, by their
late teens, about 4% of whites and 17% of blacks have been
infected with herpes virus type 2 (5). The consequences of these
infections are most severe later in life. If untreated,
gonorrheal and chlamydial infections of the cervix may progress
to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID); acute PID increases risk
for recurrent PID, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Each year,
greater than 1 million U.S. women experience an episode of PID,
with 16%-20% of cases occurring among teenagers (3,5,6).
Age-specific rates of PID are highest for adolescent females
(based on appropriate adjustments for sexual activity) (7). In a
prospective evaluation of the risk for cervical cancer after
cytologic evidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, women
less than 25 years of age had increased risk of progression (8). </p>
<p>The association between early age of sexual intercourse and
greater numbers of both recent and lifetime sex partners
represents a behavioral link to higher levels of STDs. Females
and males who have multiple sex partners over a specified period
(e.g., several months) are at increased risk for gonorrhea,
syphilis, chlamydia, and chancroid (9). Increased numbers of sex
partners over a lifetime is associated with a greater cumulative
risk for acquiring viral infections such as hepatitis B, genital
herpes, HPV, and human immunodeficiency virus (9). Efforts to
prevent the adverse health outcomes of sexual activity in
adolescents should include 1) innovations for early detection and
treatment of STDs among teenagers, 2) specialized training for
clinicians providing health services for adolescents, 3) school
education coupled with accessible clinical services, and 4)
behavioral interventions to prevent exposure to and acquisition
of sexually transmitted infections. </p>

<p>** Because some women in each age group will have premarital
sexual intercourse for the first time after March 1 but before
reaching their next birthday, the proportions do not represent
true age-specific rates. However, time comparisons are valid
because the proportions are similarly computed for each
comparison year. <p><font color="#FF0000">
