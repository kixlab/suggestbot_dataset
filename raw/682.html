<a href="/sites/production/files/2019-04/total-ghg-2019-caption.jpg" target="_blank">Larger image to save or print</a></span></span>Greenhouse gases trap heat and make the planet warmer. Human activities are responsible for almost all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 years.<sup><a href="#t1fn1">1</a></sup> The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United States is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation.</p>

		<p>EPA tracks total U.S. emissions by publishing the <a href="/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks"><em>Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks</em></a>. This annual report estimates the total national greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with human activities across the United States.</p>

		<p>The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are:</p>

		<ul><li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#transportation">Transportation</a></span> (28.9 percent of 2017 greenhouse gas emissions) â€“ The transportation sector generates the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation primarily come from burning fossil fuel for our cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes. Over 90 percent of the fuel used for transportation is petroleum based, which includes primarily gasoline and diesel.<sup><a href="#t1fn2">2</a></sup></li>
			<li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#electricity">Electricity production</a></span> (27.5 percent of 2017 greenhouse gas emissions) â€“ Electricity production generates the second largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. Approximately 62.9 percent of our electricity comes from burning fossil fuels, mostly coal and natural gas.<sup><a href="#t1fn3">3</a></sup></li>
			<li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#industry">Industry</a></span> (22.2 percent of 2017 greenhouse gas emissions) â€“ Greenhouse gas emissions from industry primarily come from burning fossil fuels for energy, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from certain chemical reactions necessary to produce goods from raw materials.</li>
			<li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#commercial-and-residential">Commercial and Residential</a></span> (11.6 percent of 2017 greenhouse gas emissions) â€“ Greenhouse gas emissions from businesses and homes arise primarily from fossil fuels burned for heat, the use of certain products that contain greenhouse gases, and the handling of waste.</li>
			<li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#agriculture">Agriculture</a></span> (9.0 percent of 2017 greenhouse gas emissions) â€“ Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture come from livestock such as cows, agricultural soils, and rice production.</li>
			<li><span class="menu-internal"><a href="#land-use-and-forestry">Land Use and Forestry</a></span> (offset of 11.1 percent of 2017 greenhouse gas emissions) â€“ Land areas can act as a sink (absorbing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere) or a source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, since 1990, managed forests and other lands have absorbed more CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere than they emit.</li>
		</ul><h2>Emissions and Trends</h2>

		<p>Since 1990, gross U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 1.3 percent. From year to year, emissions can rise and fall due to changes in the economy, the price of fuel, and other factors. In 2017, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions decreased compared to 2016 levels. The decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuel combustion was a result of multiple factors, including a continued shift from coal to natural gas, increased use of renewables in the electric power sector, and milder weather that contributed to less overall electricity use.</p>

<a href="/sites/production/files/2019-04/electricity-ghg-2019-caption.jpg" target="_blank">Larger image to save or print</a></span></span>The Electricity sector involves the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. <a href="#carbon-dioxide">Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a> makes up the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions from the sector, but smaller amounts of <a href="#methane">methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</a> and <a href="#nitrous-oxide">nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</a> are also emitted. These gases are released during the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to produce electricity. Less than 1 percent of greenhouse gas emissions from the sector come from <a href="#f-gases">sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>)</a>, an insulating chemical used in electricity transmission and distribution equipment.</p>

		<h2>Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Electricity Sector by Fuel Source</h2>

		<p>Coal combustion is more carbon intensive than burning natural gas or petroleum for electricity. Although coal use accounted for about 67.9 percent of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the sector, it represented only 31.2 percent of the electricity generated in the United States in 2017. Natural gas use accounted for 31.2 percent of electricity generation in 2017, and petroleum use accounted for less than one percent. The remaining generation in 2017 came from non-fossil fuel sources, including nuclear (21.0 percent) and renewable energy sources (16.2 percent), which include hydroelectricity, biomass, wind, and solar.<sup><a href="#Electricity_ref">1</a></sup> Most of these non-fossil sources, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, and solar, are non-emitting.</p>

		<h2>Emissions and Trends</h2>

		<p>In 2017, the electricity sector was the second largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 27.5 percent of the U.S. total. Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity have decreased by about 5.2 percent since 1990 due to a shift in generation to lower- and non-emitting sources of electricity generation and an increase in end-use energy efficiency.</p>

<a href="/sites/production/files/2019-04/total-2019-caption.jpg" target="_blank">Larger image to save or print</a></span></span>Electricity is used by other sectorsâ€”in homes, businesses, and factories. Therefore, it is possible to attribute the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation to the sectors that use the electricity. Looking at greenhouse gas emissions by end-use sector can help us understand energy demand across sectors and changes in energy use over time.</p>

		<p>When emissions from electricity are allocated to energy end-use sectors, industrial activities account for a much larger share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from commercial and residential buildings also increase substantially when emissions from electricity end-use are included, due to the relatively large share of electricity use (e.g., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; lighting; and appliances) in these sectors.</p>

		<h2>Reducing Emissions from Electricity</h2>

		<p>There are a variety of opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. The table below categorizes these opportunities and provides examples.

The majority of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation are <a href="#carbon-dioxide">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a> emissions resulting from the combustion of petroleum-based products, like gasoline, in internal combustion engines. The largest sources of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions include passenger cars and light-duty trucks, including sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and minivans. These sources account for over half of the emissions from the transportation sector. The remaining greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector come from other modes of transportation, including freight trucks, commercial aircraft, ships, boats, and trains, as well as pipelines and lubricants.</p>

		<p>Relatively small amounts of <a href="#methane">methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</a> and <a href="#nitrous-oxide">nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</a> are emitted during fuel combustion. In addition, a small amount of <a href="#f-gases">hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)</a> emissions are included in the Transportation sector.

		<p>In 2017, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation accounted for about 28.9 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest contributor of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of the overall trend, from 1990 to 2017, total transportation emissions have increased due, in large part, to increased demand for travel. The number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by light-duty motor vehicles (passenger cars and light-duty trucks) increased by 45.9 percent from 1990 to 2017, as a result of a confluence of factors including population growth, economic growth, urban sprawl, and periods of low fuel prices. Between 1990 and 2004, average fuel economy among new vehicles sold annually declined, as sales of light-duty trucks increased. Starting in 2005, average new vehicle fuel economy began to increase while light-duty VMT grew only modestly for much of the period. Average new vehicle fuel economy has improved almost every year since 2005, and the truck share is about 45 percent of new vehicles in model year 2016.</p>

The greenhouse gases emitted during industrial production are split into two categories:<strong> direct emissions</strong> that are produced at the facility, and <strong>indirect emissions</strong> that occur off site, but are associated with the facility's use of electricity.</p>

		<p><strong>Direct emissions</strong> are produced by burning fuel for power or heat, through chemical reactions, and from leaks from industrial processes or equipment. Most direct emissions come from the consumption of fossil fuels for energy. A smaller amount of direct emissions, roughly one third, come from leaks from natural gas and petroleum systems, the use of fuels in production (e.g., petroleum products used to make plastics), and chemical reactions during the production of chemicals, iron and steel, and cement.</p>

		<p><strong>Indirect emissions</strong> are produced by burning fossil fuel at a power plant to make electricity, which is then used by an industrial facility to power industrial buildings and machinery.</p>

		<p>More information about facility-level emissions from large industrial sources is available through EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program's <a href="http://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do">data publication tool</a>.

Including both direct emissions and indirect emissions associated with electricity use, industry's share of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 was 29.7 percent, making it the largest contributor of greenhouse gases of any sector.

Greenhouse gas emissions from this sector come from <strong>direct emissions</strong> including fossil fuel combustion for heating and cooking needs, management of waste and wastewater, and leaks from refrigerants in homes and businesses as well as <strong>indirect emissions</strong> that occur offsite but are associated with use of electricity consumed by homes and businesses.</p>

		<p><strong>Direct emissions</strong> are produced from residential and commercial activities in a variety of ways:</p>

		<ul><li>Combustion of natural gas and petroleum products for heating and cooking needs emits <a href="#carbon-dioxide">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a>, <a href="#methane">methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</a>, and <a href="#nitrous-oxide">nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</a>. Emissions from natural gas consumption represent 89.0 percent of the direct fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the residential and commercial sectors. Coal consumption is a minor component of energy use in both of these sectors.</li>
			<li>Organic waste sent to landfills emits CH<sub>4</sub>.</li>
			<li>Wastewater treatment plants emit CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
			<li><a href="#f-gases">Fluorinated gases</a> (mainly hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs) used in air conditioning and refrigeration systems can be released during servicing or from leaking equipment.</li>
		</ul><p><strong>Indirect emissions</strong> are produced by burning fossil fuel at a power plant to make electricity, which is then used in residential and commercial activities such as lighting and for appliances.</p>

		<h2>Emissions and Trends</h2>

		<p>In 2017, direct greenhouse gas emissions from homes and businesses accounted for 11.6 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from homes and businesses vary from year to year based on short-term fluctuations in energy consumption caused primarily by weather conditions. Total residential and commercial greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 have increased by 3.4 percent since 1990. Greenhouse gas emissions from on-site direct emissions in homes and businesses have decreased by 3.2 percent since 1990. Additionally, indirect emissions from <a href="#electricity">electricity</a> use by homes and businesses have increased by 7.8 percent since 1990, due to increasing electricity consumption for lighting, heating, air conditioning, and appliances.</p>

		<ul><li>Various management practices on agricultural soils can lead to increased availability of nitrogen in the soil and result in emissions of <a href="#nitrous-oxide">nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</a>. Specific activities that contribute to N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from agricultural lands include the application of synthetic and organic fertilizers, the growth of nitrogen-fixing crops, the drainage of organic soil, and irrigation practices. Management of agricultural soils accounts for almost half of the emissions from the Agriculture economic sector.*</li>
			<li>Livestock, especially ruminants such as cattle, produce <a href="#methane">methane ( CH<sub>4</sub>)</a> as part of their normal digestive processes. This process is called enteric fermentation, and it represents almost one third of the emissions from the Agriculture economic sector.</li>
			<li>The way in which manure from livestock is managed also contributes to CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Different manure treatment and storage methods affect how much of these greenhouse gases are produced. Manure management accounts for about 14 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the Agriculture economic sector in the United States.</li>
			<li>Smaller sources of agricultural emissions include CO<sub>2</sub> from liming and urea application, CH<sub>4</sub> from rice cultivation, and burning crop residues, which produces CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
		</ul><p>More national-level information about emissions from agriculture can be found in the <a href="/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks">agriculture chapter in the </a><a href="/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks"><em>Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks</em></a><em>.</em></p>

		<h2>Emissions and Trends</h2>

		<p>In 2017, greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture economic sector accounted for 9.0 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture have increased by 8.8 percent since 1990. One driver for this increase has been the 57.1 percent growth in combined CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from livestock manure management systems, reflecting the increased use of emission-intensive liquid systems over this time period. Emissions from other agricultural sources have either remained flat or changed by a relatively small amount since 1990.</p>

		<h2>Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry Sector Emissions and Sequestration</h2>

		<p>Plants absorb <a href="#carbon-dioxide">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a> from the atmosphere as they grow, and they store some of this carbon as aboveground and belowground biomass throughout their lifetime. Soils and dead organic matter/litter can also store some of the carbon from these plants depending on how the soil is managed and other environmental conditions (e.g., climate). This storage of carbon in plants, dead organic matter/litter and soils is called biological carbon sequestration. Because biological sequestration takes CO<sub>2</sub> out of the atmosphere and stores it in these carbon pools, it is also called a carbon "sink."</p>

		<p>Emissions or sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub>, as well as emissions of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O can occur from management of lands in their current use or as lands are converted to other land uses. Carbon dioxide is exchanged between the atmosphere and the plants and soils on land, for example, as cropland is converted into grassland, as lands are cultivated for crops, or as forests grow. In addition, using biological feedstocks (such as energy crops or wood) for purposes such as electricity generation, as inputs to processes that create liquid fuels, or as building materials can lead to emissions or sequestration.*</p>

		<p>In the United States overall, since 1990, Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) activities have resulted in more removal of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere than emissions. Because of this, the LULUCF sector in the United States is considered a net sink, rather than a source, of CO<sub>2</sub> over this time-period. In many areas of the world, the opposite is true, particularly in countries where large areas of forest land are cleared, often for conversion to agricultural purposes or for settlements. In these situations, the LULUCF sector can be a net source of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

		<ul><li>More national-level information about land use, land-use change, and forestry is available from the <a href="/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks">Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry chapter in the <em>Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks</em></a>.

		<h3 id="dialog-title">6,457Â million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent â€“ what does that mean?</h3>

		<h4>An Explanation of Units</h4>

		<p>A million metric tons is equal to about 2.2 billion pounds, or 1 trillion grams. For comparison, a small car is likely to weigh a little more than 1 metric ton. Thus, a million metric tons is roughly the same mass as 1 million small cars!</p>

		<p>The U.S. Inventory uses metric units for consistency and comparability with other countries. For reference, a metric ton is a little bit larger (about 10 percent) than a U.S. "short" ton.</p>

		<p>Greenhouse gasÂ emissions are often measured in carbon dioxide (<em>CO<sub>2</sub></em>) <em>equivalent</em>. To convert emissions of a gas into CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent, its emissions are multiplied by the gas's <a href="/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials">Global Warming Potential (GWP)</a>. The GWP takes into account the fact that many gases are more effective at warming Earth than CO<sub>2</sub>, per unit mass.</p>

		<p>The GWP values appearing in the Emissions Web pages reflect the values used in the U.S. Inventory, which are drawn from the IPCC's Second Assessment Report (SAR). For further discussion of GWPs and an estimate ofÂ greenhouse gasÂ emissions using updated GWPs, see Annex 6 of the <a href="/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014">U.S. Inventory</a> and the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-10-2.html">IPCC's discussion on GWPs</a>.Â <a title="EPA's External Link Disclaimer" class="exit-disclaimer" href="/home/exit-epa">Exit</a></p>
