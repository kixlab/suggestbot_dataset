<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="EPA_scientists_revolt">EPA scientists revolt</span></h2>
<p>It's a press release, but a pretty shocking one:
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.yubtubaanet.com/artman/publish/article_46573.shtml">More Than 10,000 EPA Scientists File Mass Petition for Action on Global Warming</a>, November 29, 2006 <a href="/wiki/User:Simesa" title="User:Simesa">Simesa</a> 01:59, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>And a pretty inaccurate one.  The actual document is a letter from 22 union bosses <i>representing</i> a union with over 10,000 scientists <i>and support staff.</i> The so-called "petition" makes no actual mention of a petition anywhere.  Entry 306(b)(i) in my  <i>Guidebook to the Real World</i> is "Never trust a press release." <a href="/wiki/User:Raymond_arritt" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 04:09, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>The press release reads as follows&#160;: "In an unprecedented action, representatives for more than 10,000 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency scientists are calling on Congress to take immediate action against global warming [...]. The is letter (sic!) signed by presidents of 22 locals of five unions". I can't find a misleading statement in there which would differ from your explanation. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Hardern&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Hardern (page does not exist)">Hardern</a> 17:30, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>What about the headline? <a href="/wiki/User:Narssarssuaq" title="User:Narssarssuaq">Narssarssuaq</a> 17:52, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yeah, you're right about that. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Hardern&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Hardern (page does not exist)">Hardern</a> 17:23, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The headlines for Global Warming hysteria articles are often like that. It would be same as saying if a US President opposed radical action on Global Warming saying "300,000,000 American opposed to action on Global Warming"  because the leader says so.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Neutrality_Of_the_Article">Neutrality Of the Article</span></h2>
<p>The neutrality of this article is disputable. 
</p><p>Allow me to put away any preconceived ideas I hold in regards to Global Warming.
</p><p>From reading the article, and having explored various points of view in regards to global warming (specifically, the two sides of the debate) I think that there is substance to both points of view.
</p><p>Therefore due acknowledgment of the arguments against Global Warming could be included with either a criticism section or perhaps an NPOV label. 
</p><p>Note:
</p>
     <blockquote><p>"Often, authors can view "their" articles as being NPOV, while others disagree. That an article is in an NPOV dispute does not necessarily mean it is biased, only that someone feels that it is. Note, however, that there is a strong inductive argument that, if a page is in an NPOV dispute, it very probably is not neutral — or, at least, <strong>that the topic is a controversial one, and one should be wary of a possible slant or bias. The salient point is that one side — who cares enough to be making the point — thinks that the article says something that other people would want to disagree with.</strong>"</p></blockquote>
<p><a class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_dispute#How_can_neutrality_be_achieved.3F">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_dispute#How_can_neutrality_be_achieved.3F</a>
</p><p>Although the arguments against global warming have been previously presented I believe that there are grounds for a more substantial presentation of the case. Alternate theories that identify different, supporting causes of the same issue, do not replicate outright dispute of the entire issue as a whole.
</p><p>Below is an interesting article to assist with the creation of a criticism section:
<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/11/12/nclim12.xml">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/11/12/nclim12.xml</a>

</p><p>And another good one:
<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.nov55.com/gbwm.html">http://www.nov55.com/gbwm.html</a> 
</p><p>The above links may help, although further research into the 'against' arguments is recommended.

<dl><dd>The issue, to my understanding, is that there really aren't that many coherent alternative explanations for collected observations. What there are in the way of complete theories are presented in the "Alternative Theories" section. The rest of the criticism is mostly picking at particular points, studies, or issues, and all the various nitpicking cannot actually be collected into a coherent theory, indeed much of it is mutually contradictory. So, in summary, where actual alternative theories exist they are presented, and the remaining criticism is simply to scattered and mutually inconsistent to be presented in any reasonable way in an article such as this. <a href="/wiki/User:Leland_McInnes" title="User:Leland McInnes">Leland McInnes</a> 23:17, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I think that this whole section needs to be rewritten. The articles should be split into at least 2 separate pages: 
</p><p>The 'Global Warming' page should consist of the <b>observed facts</b> regarding the Earth's temperatures. This would include geological temperatures (including methodology of calculation, confidence, etc). As well as more recent temperature trends - Middle Ages, 'mini ice age' and 20th Century warming. 
</p><p>The second page should be titled something like 'Global Warming Theory' and should present <b>both</b> sides of the argument to whether or not humans are responsibe for the observed warming of the planet and possible future events. 
</p><p>As it stands, this article is biased and doesn't even come close to a NPOV. There is not even a warning at the top of the page warning that the article is disputed. I have read through the comments in this discussion and I can't believe how arogantly the editors are behaving. I have a geochemistry degree. There is no way that the 'theory of man made global warming' is as accepted as the 'theory of gravity'(as some people are trying to claim, in order to push their own agenda). 'Global Warming' is theory that can't be tested in any way. Which planet are you proposing to use as our 'control'? If we cut CO<sub>2</sub> levels and the temperature of the Earth also falls, does that 'prove' the theory? What about if we cut CO<sub>2</sub> and the temperatures still keep rising? How about we maintain our current levels of CO<sub>2</sub> output, but the temperatures fall? What does that 'prove'? 
</p><p>At present we have an observed fact (the world is getting slowly warmer) and we have a theory as to why this is happening (greenhouse effect). Nobody has proved this to be the case. There is not a total scientific consensus, or anything close to it. 
</p><p>In order to acheive a NPOV, the article must be split into at least 2 sections - scientific fact and theory. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Grimerking&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Grimerking (page does not exist)">Grimerking</a> 13:44, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Well, good thing that no-one proposed that the 'theory of man made global warming' is as accepted as the 'theory of gravity'. What some have tried to do is show that a "theory" is not a guess, but a coherent explanation for a set of facts that allows us to create testable predictions. And of course 'Global Warming' theory can be tested, both temporarily (as e.g. by Hansen's 1988 predictions) and spatially, by predicting certain not-yet observed effects and testing if they are true. And if you think science can "prove" anything in an absolute sense, i.e. outside the bounds of an assumed theory, you should contact your university for a refund. --<a href="/wiki/User:Stephan_Schulz" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 14:04, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Controversy_Section">Controversy Section</span></h2>
<pre>    I am somewhat startled to find that the controversy section of Global Warming is so covered in bias and conspiracy. I 
</pre>
<p>have just finished reading Michael Crichton's book "State of Fear" and I now question the validity of the arguments made by so 
called global warming specialists. Crichton makes a wonderful agrument through a fictional book that global warming is 
overstated and not as thoroughly studied as it has been suggested in the media. Though his books are fanciful, he has many 
references and seems to have done good research in so much that he seems to be able to back up his statements.  I would be 
interested in peoples comments on Crichtons book and the views which he has stated.
</p>
<pre>    As a side note; those who would say that there is "No controversy in global warming" sound like zealots who have lost the 
</pre>
<p>point of debate and are no longer able to make noteworthy comments. A theory in science is always debated and there are always 
those who have dissenting views unless that debate is fake, dictated and otherwise worthless.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:24.10.167.243&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:24.10.167.243 (page does not exist)">24.10.167.243</a> 01:34, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>There is no <i>controversy</i> about the existence of global warming and there is no <i>controversy</i> that the answer is significantly reduced global emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 and methane. At the start of 2007 these are now mainstream accepted facts. In Europe they have been generally accepted for a few years. <br />
There is no controversy among climate scientists who have had peer reviewed papers published. <a href="/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change#Oreskes.2C_2004" title="Scientific opinion on climate change">Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change#Oreskes.2C_2004</a><br />
There is no controversy among national governments on the existence of global Warming. This can be seen from the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Kyoto_Protocol_signatories" class="mw-redirect" title="List of Kyoto Protocol signatories">List_of_Kyoto_Protocol_signatories</a> <br />
There is no controversy among the science academies of the G8 countries, Brazil china and India. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/document.asp?latest=1&amp;id=3222">[7]</a><a href="/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change#Joint_science_academies.E2.80.99_statement" title="Scientific opinion on climate change">Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change#Joint_science_academies.E2.80.99_statement</a><br />
Major corporations including General Electric, DuPont, Alcoa, and also Caterpillar (manufacturing)  Duke Energy, PG&amp;E, FPL Group,PNM Resources (four energy utilities) BP (multinational oil company) Lehman Brothers (finance) are calling for a firm US limit on carbon dioxide emissions that would lead to reductions of 10 to 30 percent over the next 15 years. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/business/19carbon.html?th&amp;emc=th">[8]</a><br />

</p><p>My addition of a Controversy section linking to data from the article "Global warming controversy" has been reverted within the first five minutes of being posted. This leads me to believe that this article is being watched "like a hawk" to say, by some people. Mainly, I would like to point out that this article shows a very one sided and supportive view of the global warming theory and that a section showing criticism from the crtitics (yes there are critics) namely those displayed on the "Global warming controversy" is desperately needed to maintain a balanced article. While there is link to the article "Global warming controversy" in the see also section, it is buried amongst twenty or so other links. To maintain balance there needs to be a promintent section of this article showing the other view. Can we have this section or will my edits be thwarted with reverts? <a href="/wiki/User:The_machine512" title="User:The machine512">The machine512</a> 05:28, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I would like to add that 'hawk eyes' are now an epidemic of gigantic proportions in the wiki system and these ‘hawk eyes’ are now a serious disruption to the Wiki-spirit and Wiki-process.
</p><p>Article after Article have been subsumed by groups of people who are completely one-celled and hell bent on squelching the voices of dissent. 
There almost seems to be an organized effort to ensure that dissenting opinions do not find place on the main wiki pages. 
</p><p>Eg: 
</p>
<ul><li>The Moon landing Article – the ‘<b>hawk eyes’</b> refuse to even acknowledge that some people suspect foul play in moon landing videos. No, they would rather revert the postings.</li>
<li>The AIDS Epidemic Article - the <b>‘hawk eyes’</b> refuse to acknowledge that there may not be an epidemic after all. In Africa, the only way to get treatment for common diseases is to say that you got AIDS. The only hospitals in remote areas are ‘AIDS Hospitals’. so AIDS numbers come out inflated.</li>
<li>The Compact Fluorescent Lamps Article – the efficiency formula are actually wrong. [CFLs have terrible power factors] but the <b>‘hawk eyes’</b> refuse to change them because it makes the CFLs look less good, and that goes against their agenda. It is actually a pollution amplifier.</li>
<li>The Solar energy Article - the ‘hawk eyes’ refuse to acknowledge that solar cells are not all that efficient, and that huge amounts of conventional energy have to spent to manufacture solar cells. It is in fact a pollution amplifier.</li>
<li>The Hydrogen Economy Article- the ‘hawk eyes’ refuse to acknowledge that hydrogen doesn’t occur in free form in nature and that it requires more energy to manufacture hydrogen than what it given out by burning it. In its current form Hydrogen economy is a pollution amplifier.</li>
<li>The free energy Article – The ‘hawk eyes’ refuse to acknowledge that people have been experimenting with perpetual motion machines. They may not get anywhere, but outright removal of postings is not acceptable.</li>
<li>The Nuclear Energy Article - The ‘hawk eyes’ refuse to acknowledge that there actually may be clean nuclear energy.</li></ul>
<p>And on and on the list goes. Some very monotonic epsilon minuses have taken over the wikipedia system. It is now very close to sabotage.

<p>Reverted again, sigh. I don't understand your reason for reverting, you stated:
</p><p>"Reverted again. There is a link to the controversy from the lead section. Duplication of content is no good, use summary style!"
</p><p>It seems like you are using two very different reasons for the reversion. By lead section I am assuming you mean the subtopics box at the very bottom of the page as otherwise controversy or criticism is not mentioned anywhere else throughout this entire article. And if you are referring to the subtopics box, many of the main articles such as <a href="/wiki/Mitigation_of_global_warming" class="mw-redirect" title="Mitigation of global warming">Mitigation of global warming</a> are summarized in this main article just as I did with <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_controversy" title="Global warming controversy">Global warming controversy</a>. And in terms of duplication, I did the same system of summary as is done with mitigation. So what is the problem?? Is there something wrong with presenting both viewpoints in the article? Please explain further.

<dl><dd>I'm not referring to the subtopic box, but to the last paragraph of the introduction, which states (in part): "However, the <a href="/wiki/Uncertainty" title="Uncertainty">uncertainty</a> is more significant regarding how much climate change should be expected in the future, and there is a hotly contested <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_controversy" title="Global warming controversy">political and public debate</a> (<b>This links to <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_controversy" title="Global warming controversy">global warming controversy</a></b>) over implementation of policies that deal with predicted consequences, what, if anything, should be done to <a href="/wiki/Mitigation_of_global_warming" class="mw-redirect" title="Mitigation of global warming">reduce or reverse future warming</a>, and how to <a href="/wiki/Adaptation_to_global_warming" class="mw-redirect" title="Adaptation to global warming">deal with the predicted consequences</a>." And, wether you belive it or not, all notable viewpoints <i>are</i> represented adequately in the article. What you added was not a summary, but an excerpt. The summary of the dispute, as far as there is anything to summarize, is in the section I quoted and in the "Alternative hypotheses" section. --<a href="/wiki/User:Stephan_Schulz" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 11:00, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The problem is that this is allegedly an encyclopedia -- a supposedly authoritative source of information.  To relegate other viewpoints to a secondary article instead of including it in the main one gives the impression that the information is somehow less important, accurate, or relevant.  This is all-the-more important when one considers that most readers do not go to the trouble of going through the entire article that is putatively academic in nature to read the links at the bottom. --<a href="/wiki/User:TheOuthouseMouse" title="User:TheOuthouseMouse">The Outhouse Mouse</a> 19:54, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I am sure this doesn't surprise you, but I greatly disagree with your claim that "all notable viewpoints <i>are</i> represented adequately", and apparently I am not the only one, seeing that others have brought this issue up before and have been knocked down by the unfortunate <b>clique of editors here</b>. And as proof for my claim <b>not one of the scientists</b> from the section "Opponents of the global warming theory" under <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_controversy" title="Global warming controversy">Global warming controversy</a> is mentioned at all in this article. That is balanced? This is what I tried to bring into the article, a summary of the to say <b>"least critical of the critics"</b> section of <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_controversy" title="Global warming controversy">Global warming controversy</a> article (considering that whole article is pretty much biased against them), and you've reverted it, as I am sure you've reverted this topic in the past and will continue to. <b>Why can't the opinions of the critics be expressed in this article??</b> <a href="/wiki/User:The_machine512" title="User:The machine512">The machine512</a> 11:41, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>As far as I can tell, the ony scientist we name explicitely (i.e. outside of referencing a publication) is <a href="/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius" title="Svante Arrhenius">Svante Arrhenius</a>. The alternative theories section is excellently referenced. If you have reliable sources on the science (i.e. peer-reviwed scientific publications), by all means add them. But editorials in the <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" class="mw-redirect" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a> or publications by political think tanks do not confer any scientific legitimacy - see <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV#Undue_weight" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a>. The scientific consensus is supported by thousands of scientists and by the vast majority of people in the field of climate science. The critics' position isn't one at all, but a collection of shifting and incoherent talking points. Most have now given up on "there is no warming" (for any number of alleged reasons), and there is an increasing move from "it's not anthropogenic" (but caused by any of several unlikely mechanisms) to "it's not bad for us" (for another rambling collection of suggestions). --<a href="/wiki/User:Stephan_Schulz" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 11:59, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>OK, so can I show the names of the notable scientists and their "incoherent talking points"? We are mirroring summaries of just about every subtopic article except the <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_controversy" title="Global warming controversy">Global warming controversy</a> Why? I don't know (bias, agenda, who knows), but to bring balance we <b>need</b> it. Why are you ingoring such a large article with a significant number of scientists and views?
</p><p>Also "alternative theories" won't suffice (and you've stated why) because many of the critics do not have alternative theories to present! But rather they take stances such as, that the data is too inconclusive to project the many ideas and theories that the others present, that the testing methods are wrong, etc.

<dl><dd>Cut-n-paste volumes of text from the Controversy article is obviously not a good idea. Furthermore, you seem to equate "controversy" with "anti-GW"; you only pasted in "aginst". Thats not so - controversy is both sides. I rather like your <i>Also "alternative theories" won't suffice (and you've stated why) because many of the critics do not have alternative theories to present!</i> - this is all too true: what they have are <i>a collection of shifting and incoherent talking points</i>.

<p>As a matter of fact sir, I pasted text (which is exactly what was done in the mitigation section, so excuse me if this is illegal, apparently not in that case (by the way you may want to update the main article from which it comes, it is out of date) (any edits I make will likey be reverted) ) which contained a list of critics and a very large section criticizing the critics, so to be fair that was left in. Also I wouldn't call the criticism "a collection of shifting and incoherent talking points", there are some valid points from reputible scientists which should be displayed.
</p><p><b>You sir are presenting a lame excuse for not displaying the other side because it objects with <i>your view</i>.</b>
</p><p>It is really sad for the whole ideology and foundation of wikipedia, when there is an abuse of power and abuse of the system as is going on here. If anything conflicts with <i>your</i> views it is reverted. This issue has been brought up many times within this article and surrounding articles (neutrality and presenting fair viewpoints) and ingored and reverted.

<dl><dd>Well, I always like helping the minority view so here goes: it is true that there IS a link in the lead section to the contraversy (aka "Canute's") page but the anchor text confuses the link. Given the WP habit of barely relevant links to dates etc putting the Global Warming Contraversy link until anchor text saying "a political and public debate" makes it look a little like the link might be to an article about public debates. In that regard it might be improved slightly for clarity if the link was in parathesis with explanation after the words, even though its messy.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>The Wikepedia Global Warming read is based on the simple principal of democracy at work.  Reporting and building the Global Warming consensus is a self fulfilling prophecy as the consensus builders build the article which can be misleading relative to the science involved.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>From a geological view it is clear that climatic change is the rule, not the alarming exception, except if your time frame is instantaneous.  And the instantaneous timeframe is a universal human and political frailty.  This effect is compounded by how long the human global view from a scientific perspective and approach has existed:  since the earth was considered flat? Or round? Since the first time the earth was photographed in a single frame?  Or when the first real time global weather maps were produced?  How long ago were these events? What have we learned since they happened?  How has our view of the world changed?  The current clamor to document, understand and believe in global warming as written, could, in retrospect, echo back to the chicken little tale about the sky in the not too distant future.  Science is not democratic Massachusetts running on shadows and testimonies about cats to feed fires with humans, unless it becomes a movement and misses it's point.  If the news was news and not entertainment, the real global warming story would be the debate about global warming and where it would lead, if it were pursued.</dd></dl>
<p>Something should be added to the controversy section, unless there is no controversy, and like it or not, without controversy there is no science, just opinion about how conclusive it all is.  You know, the burning human effect.  Sounds a bit like rel....., is it religion or relationships I'm looking for?  It's not all the science it’s proclaimed, the article, or course, that is.

</p><p>Scientists critical of some aspects of the discussion and their donors dispute the validity of this <a href="/wiki/Guilt_by_association" class="mw-redirect" title="Guilt by association">guilt by association</a> argument, and the scientists are also themselves part of government, state college and university systems, the scientific organizations listed in the proponents section, or some mix.  Most have been considered skeptics or at least somewhat skeptical of certain points since long before the funding was provided.   For example, according to the <a href="/wiki/Forbes" title="Forbes">Forbes</a> story <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.forbes.com/business/feeds/ap/2006/07/27/ap2910768.html">[28]</a> listed above, The Intermountain Rural Electric Association of Sedalia, CO (IREA) funded Patrick Michaels because according to their <a href="/wiki/General_manager" title="General manager">GM</a> "'We cannot allow the discussion to be monopolized by the alarmists,'" and said although he "...believes global warming is real just not as big a problem as scientists claim, &lt;he&gt; acknowledged this is a special interest issue. He said the bigger concern is his 130,000 customers, who want to keep rates low, so coal-dependent utilities need to prevent any taxes or programs that penalize fossil fuel use." In that same article, <a href="/wiki/Donald_Kennedy" title="Donald Kennedy">Donald Kennedy</a> of <a href="/wiki/Science" title="Science">Science</a>  said " 'skeptics such as Michaels are lobbyists more than researchers' " and that " 'I don't think it's unethical any more than most lobbying is unethical,' " and that " ...donations to skeptics amounts to 'trying to get a political message across.' " This tends to further refine the entire dispute as being one of a political nature.
</p><p>Other criticisms of funding are made by groups known to be in direct opposition to either corporations in general or energy ones in particular, such as the <a href="/wiki/Mother_Jones" class="mw-disambig" title="Mother Jones">Mother Jones</a> criticism of <a href="/wiki/ExxonMobil" title="ExxonMobil">ExxonMobil</a> donating to groups such as the American Council for Capital Formation <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/featurex/2005/05/exxon_more.html">[29]</a>.  They complain that the ACCF presented an appendix that focused only on the uncertainties of a 2001 <a href="/wiki/NAS" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="NAS">NAS</a> report when the ACCF testified in front of the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Senate" class="mw-redirect" title="U.S. Senate">U.S. Senate</a>.  Mother Jones’ complaint seems to be only that although the ACCF usually focuses on economic critiques of policies, this time they wrote something one-sided about the science involved in the debate to support their economic position on the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a>.  Doing that, according to Mother Jones, puts them in the skeptic camp.  
</p><p>Some opponents to the anthropogenic view of global warming have also been criticized for using incorrect information or flawed analyses in support of their opposition. For example, in April 2005 <a href="/wiki/David_Bellamy" title="David Bellamy">David Bellamy</a> published a letter in the journal <i>New Scientist</i> in which he claimed that, of the 625 glaciers being observed by the World Glacier Monitoring Service, 555 of them were growing, not shrinking&#8212;a statement which, if true, would cast a good deal of doubt on the existence of global warming. It turned out, however, that Bellamy's figures were incorrect: the vast majority of the world's glaciers have been retreating for the last several decades. <a href="/wiki/George_Monbiot" title="George Monbiot">George Monbiot</a> of the <i>Guardian</i> tracked down Bellamy's original source for this information and found that it was <a href="/wiki/Fred_Singer" title="Fred Singer">Fred Singer</a>'s website.

<p>Hello, in response to your many statements.
</p><p>1. "It's repetitive":
Having a summary of the controversy article in this article is not any more repetitive than (again) having a summary of the mitigation article. Having summaries is something done widely throughout wikipedia.
</p><p>2. "It does not contribute to the science this article concentrates on"
It does not need to. Neither does the section "Global warming in popular culture" in this article. And neither does "Censorship" section in the article on the Internet contribute to the technology of the Internet.
</p><p>3. "Undue Weight"
You raise a good point here. And I would like to quote that article if I may.
</p>
<hr />
<p>"None of this is to say that tiny-minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can give them on pages specifically devoted to them.  <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. But even on such pages, though a view may be spelled out in great detail, it should not be represented as <i>the truth</i>.
</p>
<dl><dd>From <a href="/wiki/Jimbo_Wales" class="mw-redirect" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>, paraphrased from <a class="external text" href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-September/006653.html">this post from September 2003 on the mailing list</a>:
<ul><li>If a viewpoint is in the majority, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to commonly accepted reference texts;</li>
<li>If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name <i><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prominent" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:prominent">prominent</a></i> adherents;</li>
<li>If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) regardless of whether it is true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>In other words, views held only by a tiny minority of people should not be represented as though they are significant minority views, and perhaps should not be represented at all."
</p>
<hr />
<p>The second bullet point "if a view is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents" would label the critics in the <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_controversy" title="Global warming controversy">Global warming controversy</a> as being a <b>significant minority</b> just because they are <b>easily named</b> scientists (quite a few which are <b>known</b> reputable activists, over a dozen) and organizations.
</p><p>Being that the large article <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_controversy" title="Global warming controversy">Global warming controversy</a> exists:
</p><p>1. proves there is a serious scientific <b>debate over many aspects</b>
</p><p>2. proves it is also not "undue weight"
</p><p>All of which should be summarized in this article, and currently is not. <a href="/wiki/User:The_machine512" title="User:The machine512">The machine512</a> 10:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>The article is broken down into sections, and is fully referenced. Why not search dissenting views and reference them, rather than just cut and paste a list of names. If there is any serous scientific dissent it should be included in the article. I havn't come across it (dissent I come across usually comes from conservitive polititions and media commentators) so I'd welcome the infomation. How about tracking down those peer-reviewed articles? Fact is global warming scares me stupid. I'd love to be reassured. --<a href="/wiki/User:Michael_Johnson" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 11:38, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I think Michael summarises it pretty well.  Adding a huge section of text does nothing to improve the article in terms of readability or accuracy.  Listing the opponents creates undue weight - the only way to balance the list of opponents would be to list supporters.  The thousands of scientists who support the majority position on GW.  That would, of course, make the article into unreadable garbage.  Including the opponents without including the supporters creates the undue weight.  Presenting a fringe position lacking supporting publications <i>on equal footing</i> (or anything near equal footing) with the scientific position creates undue weight.  Simple enough.  <a href="/wiki/User:Guettarda" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 18:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Arbitrary_Edit_Break">Arbitrary Edit Break</span></h3>
<p>512, your proposed section is not a summary, it's an excerpt. The mitigation part is both a summary and a (near) except. Having a summary is fine, however, I claim that we already summarize the controversy adequately.
</p><p>For the rest: Your logic is unsound. "If a view is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents" does not imply that the ability to name prominet adherents implies the existance of a significant view. More general, just because A implies B, you cannot soundly deduce A from B. Moreover, the people in your list do not hold a particular view. They hold different views that only have one aspect in common.
</p><p>And finally: A significant scientific debate does not take place in newpaper editorials, think tank publications, or on web sites. It takes place in the peer-reviewed literature, at conferences and in journals. To show such a debate, bring scientific references. The <a href="/wiki/Global_warming_controversy" title="Global warming controversy">global warming controversy</a> article does not prove that "there is a serious scientific <b>debate over many aspects</b>". It shows that there is a public debate, not a scientific one.

</p><p>Hi Stephen, in response to your response of my response to your response:
</p><p>1. "Excerpt": Then I suppose there is a very fine line between excerpt and summary then? A long summary is an excerpt, and a short excerpt is a summary?
</p><p>2. As for my "Unsound Logic": You said " "If a view is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents"does not imply that the ability to name prominent adherents implies the existence of a significant view" " So isn’t the sentence’s purpose to check for undue weight?? If not what is the point of the sentence? How would you clarify this (if you can) for me and my unsound logic?

<p>You said "Moreover, the people in your list do not hold a particular view. They hold different views that only have one aspect in common." Right, they do have one aspect in common "opposition of the consensus" But sharing in this is not an adequately unified view, and should therefore be omitted?

<dl><dd>The statement by User:The machine512, specifically "You aren't a biased agenda pushing editor are you?" was an obvious attempt to frame the issue as one of political or ideological predisposition on my part rather than on the merits of the issues being discussed.  The substantive issue of overconsumption and "abuse" vs. mere "use" of the planet, if that was the issue intended to be discussed, is one that should be discussed on <i>its</i> merits.  The personalization of the issue in terms of a new question whether Kenosis is a "biased agenda pushing editor" was plainly <i>not</i> merely an "observation" of a logical flaw.  As to whether there is a logical flaw, I would assert that each of the observations I made about rationality, being out-of-date by nearly a decade on a topic that has gotten the attention of most of the scientific community only within the past two-to-three decades, about the socio-economic political bias of the organization conducting the poll and the political standing of those polled, as well as the observation about likely excuses for some of those persons' past participation in a scheme to defraud the public about the facts of global warming in order to further their highly selfish and myopic economic agendas, are all highly relevant to this talk page discussion, and all very demonstrable even if not part of the scientific consensus <i>per se</i>.  That said, I agree that as far as choice of which WP article is most appropriate to cover such issues, the material regarding "overconsumption" and "abuse of the planet" is more relvant to policy discussions covered in <a href="/wiki/Mitigation_of_global_warming" class="mw-redirect" title="Mitigation of global warming">mitigation of global warming</a> than it is to this article. ... <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Kenosis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Kenosis (page does not exist)">Kenosis</a> 19:31, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><p>

Otherwise, forget about it.

I suggest changing the loaded wording from "Only a small minority of climate scientists discount the role... to "A minority of climate scientists discount the extent of the role..."
This removes the "only" and "small" words that are already implicate in the word "minority" and notes that the disagreement is to the extent of human contribution. IE, a single, human produced molecule of methane may add to global warming but its extent is minimal. The inclusion of these words "only" "small" serves as an attempt to enhance the extent of the minority when there is no clear refernces as to said extent. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:70.90.102.194&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:70.90.102.194 (page does not exist)">70.90.102.194</a>~~

For a short period cloud cover warms things up, however, too much for too long and you start getting really cold. I think this was one of the brilliant theories that made $$$ for scientists back a few decades ago. Too many kids going to college creates theories on which we can spend $$$$ - my personal theory. Non-college related jobs tend to create polluters not thinkers - they are too busy to notice .1 degree one way or the other.

<p>Global Cooling was a theory that all prominent climatologists allegedly embraced, but now they say "it was just a theory that never gained wide acceptance", despite what the articles of the 1970s said. Soon Global Warming, which is now said to be accepted by all climatologists as fact (even though the evidence proves otherwise), soon it will be dismissed as a theory that never gained wide acceptance. All we need for that to occur is a downward trend in temperatures, much like what occured from 1940-1995. Then Global Cooling will become fact, and Global Warming will be "just a theory that a few fringe climatologists embraced, unlike Global Cooling, which we embraced all along". Then the story will change back to pollutants blocking out the sun causing cooling, rather than greenhouse gasses causing a rise in temperature. Just to let everyone know, whatever global warming is going on (as opposed to the theory, Global Warming) is mostly caused by a chemical called Dihydrogen Monoxide, also known as DHMO, and more commonly known as H2O, or water.
</p><p>Please add a neutrality dispute tag to this article, this is the most biased article I have ever seen on Wikipedia, and one of the most biased that I have ever read on the internet. It consists of opinions intermixed with the occasional rigged statistic, and makes a complete strawman out of the opposition, and that's being far too kind. The above facts aren't even mentioned, and the Little Ice Age is mostly given the brush off, and I see NO mention of the Medivel Warm Period, where temperatures rised farther and more rapidly than they have been today. This article makes CNN and CBS seem fair and balanced by comparison.
</p><p>PS: If you really are concerned about Global Warming, I suggest privatizing third world land and going with clean, efficent nuclear power, instead of allowing the Sahara Desert to expand and coal and oil power plants to throw out pollutants left and right. According to the Global Warming theory, that is what needs to be done. And also recognize that third world nations are the biggest contributers to pollution and environmental destruction, NOT first world nations like the United States. The Kyoto legislation was nothing more than an example of leftist greed to punish the United States and line their pockets, since afterall, third world nations aren't rich with money like we are. <small>—The preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Sign_your_posts_on_talk_pages" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/146.186.136.109" title="Special:Contributions/146.186.136.109">146.186.136.109</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:146.186.136.109" title="User talk:146.186.136.109">talk</a>) 00:50, 13 December 2006 (UTC).</small>

<p>I also find this article to be biased.  Clearly there have been cooling cycles within the last 50 years, so to say we are unarguably warming is false, unless you limit your observation to a period - such as "over the last 10 years".  Because there was a cooling cycle well after we became industrialized, it's further unreasonable to explain warming as being caused by the growth of industry.  Finally, a consensus among like-minded individuals (IPCC), does not make the theory fact.

<dl><dd>Ummm...the IPCC authors are not a group of "like-minded individuals", but the cream of the international climatology community. The global temperature over the last 150 or so years is well understood and can be explained to a very high degree of precision by looking at natural and artificial forcings, with the temporary downward trend starting in the mid 1940s or so being mostly caused by sulphur aerosols.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Yes, and we can be absolutely sure that it will destroy the world (give me a break). More research is need, Stephen. MORE RESEARCH. A spike in the global temperature is <i>not</i> evidence of global warming&#8212; how do you know that this hasn't happened in the past 2,000 years or so? The "Little Ice Age" that occured from the 1300's to the 1800's was no doubt a result of volcanic activity and the fact that there wasn't much methane emissions. Of course, methane has caused some warmup, but it's probably affected by a natural fluctuation occuring on the sun (like a series of solar flares or some such thing). If you are as worried as you appear to be about this "fact", then stop farting so much. That's where a lot of the methane comes from&#8212; cow and people flatulence.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>More research is something that every scientist will consent to. But that does not mean we do not already have a reasonably good understanding of the climate - sufficiently well to understand the core mechanisms of global warming. "A spike in the global temperature" is the very definition of global warming. An observed spike in the temperature is not by itself sufficient evidence to induce the theory of anthropogenic global warming. But then, the core of this theory has been around since long before we could observe the warming. The observed warming trend confirms the theory that is based on a reasonably good understanding of the radiative and absorbing properties of the Earth and atmospheric gases. The "little ice age", if it existed as a global phenomenon, was correlated with both some  volcanic activity and a reduction in solar activity (see e.g. the <a href="/wiki/Maunder_minimum" class="mw-redirect" title="Maunder minimum">Maunder minimum</a>), and so your "no doubt" is misplaced. This is the first time that I hear about reduced methane emissions during that time - do you have a source? And yes, human flatulence does produce methane, but in negligible amounts compared to ruminants and other sources (losses in natural gas production and transport, rice paddies, termites, ...).

<p>As the OP for this section, can I just advise you, Amatulic, that not everyone who happens to disagree with your POV is a troll.  That is one of the most inane and immature comments I've ever seen posted by a regular on here and I suggest you think out your responses before resorting to mere abuse like that.  My point was that Global Warming - as the consensus has it right now - is still a theory.  I'm certainly not trying to rubbish the theory, but would have preferred to have seen it in proper context: the evidence is compelling, but not conclusive - and we probably won't know for decades... at which point we can look back and either validate it or be able to say it was all, indeed, a spike.  The long term history of the planet has encompassed far wilder temperature and climate changes than anything we can expect, so very important questions remain regarding what seems to happening now actually represents (and more pertinently whether *we* have caused it and indeed whether we can do anything about it by reducing emissions or raising taxes).
</p><p>Apart from your own completely unproductive comment, the responses in this section have been measured and interesting: I think the Y2K bug scare analogy is a good one - did we actually stop a disaster through our actions, or was there really no disaster actually in the offing anyway?  We may never know.
</p><p>What's important here, for nayone who comes to Wikipedia to learn more about this subject, is that it's presented not as a "set in stone" fact, but as a theory.  Gaining ground, yes, with growing evidence, yes, but still just a theory - especially as the term itself now encompasses a far larger environmental and political meaning than "the world has been getting hotter" (which may be scientifically correct in itself - it's the causes that are at issue).
</p><p>So with respect sir, I would ask you to be a bit more circumspect when it comes to throwing terms like "troll" around.  I raised this point, after all, in the discussion section, rather than tamper with the actual article as it stands.
</p>
<dl><dd>Apologies for sounding flippant, but to be honest, I have gotten sick and tired of these "just a theory" comments from people who have no understanding of how science works, who use the word "theory" in the sense of "speculation" or "conjecture."</dd>
<dd>"Theory" has a precise scientific meaning; i.e. a consistant explanation for observations of fact. Gravity is "just a theory" too, but I see nobody debating it because it doesn't skewer anybody's sacred cows, or intrude on closed minds.</dd>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>As <a href="/wiki/User:Stephan_Schulz" title="User:Stephan Schulz">User:Stephan Schulz</a> has eloquently stated, global warming (a positive long-term trend in global surface temperatures) is an observed fact, not a theory. Strictly speaking, the theory in question is called the "greenhouse effect." We know that so-called greenhouse gases (CO2, etc.) absorb infrared radiation, but are transparent to solar radiation (this is also a fact), but the introduction of other potential feedback mechanisms within the earth system greatly complicates the modeling of this. All of this is independent of politics (thank God).  <a href="/wiki/User:LotR" title="User:LotR">LotR</a> 18:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Name-calling (e.g. childish overuse of the word "troll" for anyone who urges caution or offers a slightly different POV) is a form of bullying and has no place in this kind of debate.  It is laughable for someone whose first resort is to label a new voice a "troll" and then talk about promoting "ignorant" POVs.
</p><p>We live in a fascinating time - we are extrapolating given current facts into future trends that may have grave consequences for us all.  "Global warming", though, has come to mean more than specifically just the undoubted heating up of the globe in the last few years.  What is debatable, however, is the future - will it continue?  This is where fact meets theory.  Supoose next year the earth starts to cool again for several decades, then warms again, then cools again. What are we to make of it?  We are trying to make sense of this as we go along, but we cannot call a future event a "fact" just yet.  That we have got warmer is a fact.  That we will continue to get warmer is a theory. <small>—The preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Sign_your_posts_on_talk_pages" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:84.9.253.132&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:84.9.253.132 (page does not exist)">84.9.253.132</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:84.9.253.132" title="User talk:84.9.253.132">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/84.9.253.132" title="Special:Contributions/84.9.253.132">contribs</a>).</small> 07:12, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Just a Theory?. The Global Warming/ Climate change trend is a concrete fact and the evidence points to it. Why do people insist on denying reality? Does denial comfort you? The fact that a vast majority of the world's greatest scientists, including Stephen Hawkings, are warning us about what will happen doesn't even budge you? People that are denying the reality of this phenomena are implying that we should wait it out. But don't you see how dangerous that idea is? Even the slim chance or idea that Global Warming is real should prompt us to do something because failure to do so will prove to be our biggest mistake, ever. <small>—The preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Sign_your_posts_on_talk_pages" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="/wiki/User:Turbo_Ronin" title="User:Turbo Ronin">Turbo Ronin</a> on 02:12, December 31, 2006</small>
<dl><dd>I believe the topic-starter meant global warming, it's anthropogenity, and the <i>estimated future effects</i> of any of several continuations. This I believe is the normal, everyday meaning of "Global Warming." And that, I believe is <i>not</i> in the theory realm.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Issues">Issues</span></h2>
<p>Well, I am very displeased with this article and with wikipedia for not wishing to ensure that all sides of the issue be reported on this sensitive topic.  The integrity of this article is only about a 50 out of 100. I too have added information to the introduction of this article lending mere existance to the fact that global warming is still disputed by some, and it too has dissappeared or was even removed by wikipedia.  I believe that enough discussion has occurred here, as per their request, to warrant that tiny tidbit of informaton being sited fairly in the INTRODUCTION of this article, alongside the rant in the INTRODUCTION that argues for global warming.  If Wikipedia cannot do something so simple and fair and chooses to support silencing those whose views are contrary to their own, as a supposedly fair, balanced, and factual encyclopedia, I will have to boycott further use of this resource, because it's no resource when the information in it is purposefully skewed and where the encyclopedia takes actions that blatently support the skewing of information and the omission of facts.  Wikipedia monitors this article has has repeatedly removed such additions that alter the single-sided position of this article, for one my own addition.  Therefore, wikipedia, I request once again that this information be added and it's evidence for that sited, WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND WITHOUT DEMEANING LANGUAGE, in this article, as this is only fair and factual.  My previous changes are on file and I would not mind them being replaced.  The controversary section isn't enough because it's language is clearly demeaning to any idea that does not support global warming and the introduction starts out stating it as a fact without lending weight to other views.  I don't have a problem with calling global warming a fact, I simply want it stated that it is a fact that many people still dissagree and have good evidence to support that idea.  Just because Al Gore thinks we're headed for death doesn't make it so, as was pointed out in the last post here that just because a leader says that everyone agrees with him doesn't make it true.  I remind you that plenty of action groups, left wing radical groups and individuals, non-existant scientists, and other disreputable groups and people have also supported global warming, and therefore, I want to state for the record that just because an oil tycoon signs against global warming doesn't mean everyone who does isn't credible.  You never hear about the 10s of thousands of scientists that dispute it, but 1 that agrees with GW, he makes the front page.  Anyway, I come down hardest on wikipedia because they're the host of this article and it is their responsibility to make sure its' integrity is maintained, and there they have failed in my opinion. ----Borghuman

<p>I have edited the article, the point is that every time I do, the additions or edits are immediately removed.  The rest of this talk page contains complaints to the same.  That is my problem, whoever is doing it, and wikipedia has too, citing the issue should be "discussed," and I believe that the issue has been discussed enough, and the additions should be left alone, whoever is removing them.  Wikipedia touts that they will confirm additions to articles before they become permenant and they regularly flag information, making them editors despite the claims to the contrary.  Furthermore, as per the earth is flat comment, what you call facts are disputed by thousands of scientists...I liken it to the hysteria surrounding events where people believed the sky was falling-such as during meteor storms-the Titanic being unsinkable, the omission of books from the Bible, or the 1800's disregard for the U.S. brutal relocation of millions of Indians-America touting freedom and equality while ignoring the outrage of millions who dissagreed.  To deny that a multitude of people find that the global warming theories are flawed is merely foolish and bad for science.  
</p><p>The good scientist has to always accept the possibility that he may be wrong, and realize that other explanations cannot be ignored. (Something rarely realized-remember how they treated Einstein)  To do otherwise produces the risk of a hypothesis falling further into obscurity.  
</p><p>That is all I have to say on the matter, I'm done arguing it.

<dl><dd>I think you may be confused about global warming. Global warming is a fact, the average temperature of the earth has been steadily increasing, there's not much room for arguement there. You'd have to think our measuring equiment is flawed or there's some vast liberal conspiracy to belive global warming is a lie. It's currently the cause of gobal warming that's under dispute. The temperature of the earth natuarally goes up and down over time, but for some "strange" reason it suddenly spiked up at the same time we started letting much more CO2 into the atmosphere. 10 years ago there was a lot of debate about what caused global warming but after the temperature kept going up with the CO2 levels, as predicted, more and more scientists changed their minds. Today nearly every scientist believes global warming to be man-made, according to our references.</dd>
<dd>If tens of thousands of scientist really do deny global warming then you should have no problem proving me wrong, please cite references. --<a href="/wiki/User:Calibas" title="User:Calibas">Calibas</a> 03:35, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>

Dear Borghuman,
</p><p>"The integrity of this article is only about a 50 out of 100." What exactly are you basing this upon?
</p><p>"I too have added information to the introduction of this article lending mere existance to the fact that global warming is still disputed by some." I'm not certain I would find any serious scientist who would dispute global warming. The evidence is quite clear. However, the interpretation of cause and effect is quite a different matter. Yes, the intro is quite poor (see my comment above) but I don't feel what you are adding with your comment here.
</p><p>"I believe that enough discussion has occurred here, as per their request, to warrant that tiny tidbit of informaton being sited fairly in the INTRODUCTION of this article, alongside the rant in the INTRODUCTION that argues for global warming." There is honestly no need to shout. It tends to deafen me (and other readers I suspect) to your cause. 
</p><p>"If Wikipedia cannot do something so simple and fair and chooses to support silencing those whose views are contrary to their own, as a supposedly fair, balanced, and factual encyclopedia" I think this has been covered by the responses above. "
</p><p>"I will have to boycott further use of this resource, because it's no resource when the information in it is purposefully skewed and where the encyclopedia takes actions that blatently support the skewing of information and the omission of facts." That's your choice.
</p><p>" The controversary section isn't enough because it's language is clearly demeaning to any idea that does not support global warming and the introduction starts out stating it as a fact without lending weight to other views. I don't have a problem with calling global warming a fact, " Clarify what you mean by demeaning langauge please?
</p><p>"Just because Al Gore thinks we're headed for death doesn't make it so, as was pointed out in the last post here that just because a leader says that everyone agrees with him doesn't make it true." Just remember, some people, like myself, have been studying environmental changes for over 30 years. Honestly, many of us have noit just jumped on the bandwagon!
</p><p>"I remind you that plenty of action groups, left wing radical groups and individuals, non-existant scientists, and other disreputable groups and people have also supported global warming," You realise you don't make sense here? Perhaps you are talking about cause and effect again?
</p><p>"You never hear about the 10s of thousands of scientists that dispute it." Probably because they don't. I think it's cause and effect time again.

</p><p>PS I would have torn your addition out as well. I read it and it needs substantial rewriting in a clear and concise manner to be acceptable. Also, as you added it to an intro that I consider to be extremely unweildy (see my post above) that would have been a second reason. If you want to add information like that fI suggest you find an appropriate style and place for your addition. Thanks!

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Global_Warming">Global Warming</span></h2>
<p>Ok, so not every single person on planet Earth may agree with Global Warming. Whoever doesn't obviously has a right to disagree,  but I think everybody knows the majority always wins. In this case, the majority apparently goes to the ones that believe about global warming. I read part of the "It's Just A Theory," Section. It made me a bit angry but it was understandable. However, to say global warming's just a theory does not mean anything. Gravity was a just a theory, and I wonder what scientist (or person) in this world would disagree with the fact that gravity is what draws a object closer to a planet or star. It is almost 2007, and it seems that there are still some people that still deny global warming. Ok, there is nothing wrong with that, but it seems that those who deny never pay attention to the evidence.
The other thing I can't seem to get over is the fact that there is all this info, and yet not much (other than a book and/or movie or two,), especially on wikipedia has been done to raise awareness of global warming. Even if this article was featured already, and that this article has been a success, I am very sure that there is a huge chunk of people all over the world that may not have even heard the words "Global Warming." <small>—The preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Sign_your_posts_on_talk_pages" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/70.107.29.184" title="Special:Contributions/70.107.29.184">70.107.29.184</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.107.29.184&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:70.107.29.184 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:39, 23 December 2006 (UTC).</small>

<dl><dd>One source of dissenting views is from Professor Lindzen at MIT (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv15n2/reg15n2g.html">[46]</a> for an easily viewed article).  Another is McIntyre and McKitrick's published work <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.swampnews.squarespace.com/downloads/water-related-documents/mcintyre.ee.2005.pdf">[47]</a>.  These people are not necessarily <i>skeptics</i>, though they call into question common misconceptions, and find flaws in fundamental elements of the academic discussion of global warming.  Furthermore, if one would like to cite funding sources to discredit the skeptics, one ought to also look at the funding sources of the proponents to demonstrate lack of bias on their part.  Everybody wants security in their job, after all.  Climate change is certain - it has always changed, and always will.  The cause is not.  It is a massively complex, random system that can only be approximated, an ability that is at the cutting edge of science.  I'm not arguing for or against CO<sub>2</sub> control, or the existence of global warming.  I would like everybody to do a sanity check.  How well do you know what goes into the research?  Researchers are all human, this is a new field, and there exists substantial uncertainty. --<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Gabeh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Gabeh (page does not exist)">Gabeh</a> 08:47, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>Lindzen replied to Annan "The quote [at Reason Online] was out of context. I think the odds are about 50-50.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Doesn't look as though Dr. Lindzen is very <i>confident</i> in his skepticism, does it?</dd>
<dd>Finally, concerning your suggestion that "one ought to also look at the funding sources of the proponents to demonstrate lack of bias on their part": I believe you have it backwards. If you believe that the proponents have a <a href="/wiki/Conflict_of_interest" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a>, <i>you</i> need to demonstrate it&#8212;presumably based on the massive funding they've received from deep-pocketed environmental organizations (if such sources even exist). The conflict of interest of the prominent skeptics has been demonstrated. Now the ball's in your court.--<a href="/wiki/User:HughGRex" title="User:HughGRex">HughGRex</a> 11:35, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Yes, Lindzen has published on the topic of Global Warming, in peer-reviewed journals, as found in the publication list at <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www-eaps.mit.edu/faculty/lindzen/PublicationsRSL.html">[48]</a>.  McIntyre and McKitrick published in a peer-reviewed journal as well.</dd>
<dd>As for analyzing Dr. Lindzen's willingness to put money on the topic, as I understand, he claims that the future is very uncertain.    The fact that he isn't willing to assume the risk of losing money (by taking odds that are close to even, as he claimed) indicates that he is a conservative gambler, not that he doesn't believe in his own statement.  Note that I am not personally familiar with him, so my statement is based on the prior quotes in this page, and on the fact that I'm a conservative gambler myself (to the extent that I don't make bets for money without large odds in my favor).</dd>
<dd>Finally, in order to demonstrate that a conflict of interests is reason to discredit work, one ought to demonstrate how the money influenced a scientist to lie about data and/or analysis and conclusions.  To simply point out the funding source is not enough.  It is perfectly reasonable for an energy company to fund research to determine if their primary income source is a bad product for the world, as suggested by many researchers.  In fact, it would be irresponsible for them not to invest some research money.  When one accuses the scientists they fund of lying in order to obtain research funds, one must also consider that the larger scientific community is funded through largely public money, funneled through political channels.  The more imminent the threat, the more interest the public has in further investigation, and hence, the more research money available.  The motivation to lie and cheat is certainly there for scientists receiving public money.  I would not dare accuse them of doing so - just as I would not accuse scientists funded by energy companies of foul play without finding clear faults in their work.</dd>

<p>What do you mean by 0.6 ± 0.2 °Celcius and 25 ± 10 metres? Does it represent uncertainty? What is the actual number for each of those numbers? How did you decide to measure in metric?

<dl><dd>The expression "0.6 ± 0.2°C" indicates that the best or average measurement is 0.6 but it has an uncertainty of 0.2 in either direction, meaning it can range between 0.4 and 0.8, with 0.6 being the most probable. <i>All</i> measurements have some level of uncertainty, whether you realize it or not.

<dl><dd>The paragraph starts off with what needs to be done to slow global warming but then goes off on sea level rise. It also gets the data wrong, Hansen never says that a 3°C rise would raise sea levels 25 ± 10 meters, he says: "In contrast, sea level was 25–35m higher the last time that the Earth was 2–3°C warmer than today, i.e., during the Middle Pliocene about three million years ago". Hansen's article is useful for his list of references but it looks like it doesn't contain any original work.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Argument">Argument</span></h2>
<p>Although i am a relative novice on this subject, and my view may be overlooked, the basic reason for global warming is because of the human race.  It has been going on for centuries before polution i know, but back then the climate changed 3 degrees in millions of years.  Recently the climate has changed 1 degree in just 20 years.  I'm only 14 but that is a MAJOR difference.  Many of the people here, no offense intended, may be dead or almost dead when the results of global warming hit.  I may still be alive to recieve these results along with my children.  All this was learned from my science teacher who has worked in my school for over 35 years and is very knowledgable about the subject. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Chris_Gonzalez&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Chris Gonzalez (page does not exist)">User:Chris Gonzalez</a> Not currently signed on.

<p>At the conference it was said that increasing damage was forecast if the globe warms to about 1 to 3&#160;°Celsius (1.8 to 5.4&#160;°Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels <sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Effect_of_incident_angle_of_light_on_reflectivity">Effect of incident angle of light on reflectivity</span></h2>
<p>The contribution '(at <a href="/wiki/Reflectivity" class="mw-redirect" title="Reflectivity">low angles of incident light</a>, such as early morning, late afternoon and near the poles, water is more reflective than ice),' was replaced by modifying the previous work by adding the word 'average' to the sentence. Average is also true but hides the insight of the steep rise in reflectivity at shallow incident angles of light. The relation refers only to the angle between the direction of the photons and the surface of the water so 'direct beam (cloudless skies)' is not relevant. The issue of waves has been addressed <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://lenah.freeshell.org/pp/01-ONW-St.Petersburg/Fresnel.pdf">[57]</a> and is accounted for. At the scale of the wavelength of light, the reflectivity of water is always specular. The local angle of the (wavy) water surface is what must be used in the Fresnel calculation. Real (wavy) water reflectivity beyond about 60 degrees latitude exceeds the average reflectivity of land. Accounting for the extreme effect of the incident angle of light on reflectivity of water is mandatory for rational assessment of the effect of added water surface on global warming. <a href="/wiki/User:Dan_Pangburn" title="User:Dan Pangburn">Dan Pangburn</a> 20:01, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Need_for_long-term_geological_perspective">Need for long-term geological perspective</span></h2>
<p>Two facts which the current debate ignores (everywhere, not just in Wikipedia): (a) the Earth is currently about 3 C° cooler than its average for the last 550M years (and there's likely to be another <a href="/wiki/Ice_age" title="Ice age">glaciation</a> in the next 2000-10000 years - edited per Stpephan Schulz' comment below); (b) the current CO<sub>2</sub> level is the lowest of the last 550M years, and the last time it was nearly as low as to-day  was 300M years ago, at the Carboniferous-Permian boundary (see for example the diagram at <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/150Tetrapoda/150.100.html">[58]</a>). If you compare the same diagram with the record of major <a href="/wiki/Mass_extinction" class="mw-redirect" title="Mass extinction">mass extinctions</a>, there's no visible relationship - which is surprising, considering how often global warming is mentioned in discussions of <a href="/wiki/Mass_extinction" class="mw-redirect" title="Mass extinction">mass extinctions</a>. That does not mean there's nothing to worry about. The scaling of the diagram mentioned above would not show abrupt but geologically short-term rises in the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (less than 5M years), which might have destabilising effects on other planetological systems, e.g. by producing oceanic <a href="/wiki/Anoxic_event" title="Anoxic event">anoxic events</a>. And more care in the use of fossil fuels would be economically sensible, since easily accessible oil and gas reserves are currently expected to be exhausted in 20-30 years. But the geological evidence shows that we simply do not understand the earth's climate well enough to predict developments over the next few centuries.<a href="/wiki/User:Philcha" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 12:07, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>If it is ignored "everywhere", we cannot include the discussion per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR">WP:OR</a>. However, climatologists are aware that we currently are in an ice age (although the next natural glaciation currently seems to be expected in 10000-20000 years, so you are missing a zero there). Also, you are mixing up very different time scales here. Glaciations seem to be mostly driven by orbital influences, on the time scale of several 1000 to  several 10000 years. Ice ages are probably very much influenced by geologic configurations (land masses in high latitudes, the Americas blocking circumglobal east/west currents...), on the time scale of millions to many millions of years. Global warming is driven by greenhouse gases on the timescale of decades to millenia. Even if we knew nothing about ice age cycles (but we do), we could still have an excellent model for CO2-driven global warming.--<a href="/wiki/User:Stephan_Schulz" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 12:48, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yes, the current cold era began about 55 MYa, not so coincidentally around the time when the Indian (Indo-Australian) plate began slamming into Eurasia.

<dd><b>Stephan</b>, I said "the current debate" ignores paleoclimatology, including the "global warming" article, i.e. most of the publicised debate is flawed because it's based on very partial data. The paleoclimatological points I mentioned are not "original research", paleontologists have known about them for decades. A quick search of the Web turned up: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.purdue.edu/climate/members/huber.htm">"our understanding of modern and future climate is only as secure as our understanding of past climate. It is risky to predict future global warming without testing climate models in the past"</a> (a paleoclimatologist's "research interests" page); <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061207161142.htm">"Ancient Climate Change May Portend Toasty Future"</a>; <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060923104311.htm">"Dinosaurs' Climate Shifted Too, Reports Show"</a> (by up to 6 C&#176; in the Cretaceous, apparently without causing a mass extinction); references to Alley's book "The Two-Mile Time Machine: Ice Cores, Abrupt Climate Change, and Our Future" (apparently highly-regarded); "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/inforsch/greenhse/grnhouse.htm">The mid-Cretaceous Period ... does represent a recent geologic analog ... that can be used to predict future greenhouse conditions.</a>" (plus references to published papers). And this is the first time I've ever searched for material on paleoclimatology, as I'm more interested in paleontology and have previously treated paleoclimatology as a set of footnotes. Bottom line: there appears to be plenty of published research;  it has received little publicity; but it's relevant and Wikipedia should not ignore it.<a href="/wiki/User:Philcha" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 14:58, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl><dd>As I wrote: We are aware of many aspects of the paleoclimate, and understand some, if not all, causes of variation. Paleoclimatology can certainly help us to understand the climate system better. But it is not directly relevant to the current episode of global warming, as very different influences over very different time scales are involved. The temperature throughout the Cretaceous may well have varied within a 6 degree C window, and the Apian may have had a particular cold spell or two. But the Cretaceous spans 80 million years, and the Apian 13 million years. Even just extrapolating last centuries trend of 0.6 degrees C per century means we will have a 6 degree change in a millenium. There are 5 orders of magnitude there...--<a href="/wiki/User:Stephan_Schulz" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 22:07, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Now we're starting to have a reasonable debate. We agree that paleoclimatology can help us to understand climate mechanisms better. We disagree about: (a) whether it is relevant to the current situation; (b) how well scientists currently understand climate changes in geological time. Re (a), I'm surprised that you think paleoclimatology is irrelevant - see for example Huber's "It is risky to predict future global warming without testing climate models in the past" (reference above). The test of (b) how well we understand past climate change would be whether there are any models which successfully "predict" climates over a wide range of geological periods. And as I said in my previous post, the study of <a href="/wiki/Mass_extinction" class="mw-redirect" title="Mass extinction">mass extinctions</a> may show whether sharp changes in the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration are more important than the absolute level - and it's hard to see how that question can't be relevant.</dd>
<dd>Your last sentence, "Even just extrapolating last centuries trend ...," raises the fundamental question: is something completely new happening? On that point, I'd take issue with your linear extrapolation. For one thing, <a href="/wiki/World_population" title="World population">world population</a> has grown by a factor of nearly 4 in the last 100 years, and it's very doubtful whether that&#160;% growth rate will be maintained for another century, let alone another millenium. For example, some European countries have birth rates below the replacement level and their populations are only growing because of immigration; and IIRC Japan has concerns about declining birth rates.</dd>
<dd>If the "global warming" article summarised the paleoclimatological data / issues and discussed the impact of past and probable future population changes, it would have a considerably stronger scientific basis.<a href="/wiki/User:Philcha" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> 10:05, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

I'm all for a full and fair debate on the existence and causes on global warming....but why is it relegated to the discussion section?

<p>I believe there should be a POV tag added to this page in the hopes that a balanced view of the subject can be made available to all Wikireaders.  Thoughts?  I'm getting the impression from reading all the discussion that there are several people who share my viewpoint and have tried to make changes, but have been thwarted.  I've even read some implications that Wikiadmins are involved???  The sheer amount of argument on this page screams for a neutrality tag.
</p><p>And no, simply responding that "global warming is a fact and anyone who disputes it is clearly stupid" is not a thought.  If supporters of global warming want to continue stifling critics and ignoring skeptics, that's their prerogative.  But it has no place here, where the whole point is to fully educate readers on a particular issue.  The DEBATE about global warming is what's important, and needs substantially more representation here. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:JQLibet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JQLibet (page does not exist)">JQLibet</a> 20:59, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Here's why. Because whenever someone tries to moderate this piece of agitprop, there's a gang of editors, including some wearing admin badges, who will tag-team revert and refuse to discuss.

<p>Why there is no POV tag on this article? Because there is no POV dispute that is motivated by climate science. Similarly, there is no POV tag on the article about evolution. This does not mean that there are no disputes about the neutrality about that article. It only means the creationists don't dispute the science behind evolution, they just reject it entirely.
</p><p>Like the article on evolution, this article gives the scientific perspective on global warming. This means that we don't take posting on right wing anti-climate science blogs seriously. These people, who constantly complain about "alarmist views", often applaud right wing politicians who argue that we need to stay the course in Iraq or else Bin Laden will become the next US president&#160;:)  <a href="/wiki/User:Count_Iblis" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 21:57, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Unfortunately that isn't true. The evolution article is quite good. The creationists come by and try to deface it periodically, but they've never achieved critical mass to be able to takeover the article. Here the situation is opposite.  <a href="/wiki/User:Arker" title="User:Arker">Arker</a> 04:03, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Ironically, the greenhouse effect and global climate change are both far better understood phenomena than Darwinian evolution. <a href="/wiki/User:LotR" title="User:LotR">LotR</a> 16:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>You know what? In a sense, that's correct. It's not a *relevant* sense, but it is a conceivable one. The difference here is that there is _no_ competing theory to neo-darwinian evolution which comes close to meshing with the available evidence, while there are alternative theories to the catastrophic-anthropogenic-global-warning-theory that could reasonably explain the data. <a href="/wiki/User:Arker" title="User:Arker">Arker</a> 07:50, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The problem is that these complaints are strawmen. Its no good saying <i>For one example: "Climate change is real" is a meaningless phrase used repeatedly by activists to convince the public that a climate catastrophe is looming</i> when the article says nothing whatsoever about doom or catastrophe <a href="/wiki/User:William_M._Connolley" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 22:04, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Count, the argument that this article shouldn't be tagged because an article about evolution is not tagged doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  But since you brought it up, the Evolution article on Wikipedia proudly features a section entitled "Social and Religious Controversies."  Yet it's too much to ask to include the scientific debate on Global Warming here?  And there are several prominent scientists that don't reject global warming, but simply reject the contention that humans have caused it.  You're telling me this has no place in the Wikipedia article?  You claim this article gives the scientific perspective on global warming, while completely ignoring the fact that there are several perspectives that contradict each other.  Your comments about right wing anti-climate science blogs or staying the course in Iraq are completely outside the bounds of any meaningful discussion and I will not address them.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Mr. Connolley, I believe you are trying to convolute the issue.  The Global Warming article clearly speaks to doom and catastrophe: "Some anticipated effects include sea level rise, repercussions to agriculture, Shutdown of thermohaline circulation, glacier retreat, reductions in the ozone layer, increased intensity and frequency of hurricanes and extreme weather events, lowering of Ocean pH, and the spread of disease."  The full Wikipedia article on the Effects of Global Warming (<a class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming</a>) goes into great detail about economic damage and deaths attributable to or potentially created by global warming.  Sounds pretty catastrophic to me.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I think the paragraphs and paragraphs of intellectual comments and debate above speak for themselves.  Global warming is a scientific theory with outspoken advocates and critics.  Both deserve representation.  <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:JQLibet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JQLibet (page does not exist)">JQLibet</a> 22:55, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I disagree. The GW article should *not* speak about D+C. If if does, that needs to be fixed &amp; I will be happy to help. The intro sez <i>Other consequences include <b>higher</b> or lower agricultural yields, glacier retreat, reduced summer streamflows, species extinctions and increases in the ranges of disease vectors. Warming is expected to affect the number and magnitude of these events; however, it is difficult to connect particular events to global warming</i> (my emphasis on the higher). Do you think that list is unreasonable? <i>glacier retreat, reduced summer streamflows</i> is definitely reasonable. And I notice you omit the para immeadiately following your quote: <i>The extent and probability of these consequences is a matter of considerable uncertainty</i> - doesn't that answer much of your problem? I've weakened the THC bit.</dd>
<dd>As to the controversy: there is a link to it in the intro: <i>Remaining scientific uncertainties include the exact degree of climate change expected in the future, and especially how changes will vary from region to region across the globe. A hotly contested political and public debate has yet to be resolved, regarding whether anything should be done, and what could be cost-effectively done to reduce or reverse future warming, or to deal with the expected consequences.</i> - and there is a whole section on alternative hypotheses.

And you are the one who seeks out peoples talk pages to try and use that to attack them. Further there is nothing attacking religion on my user page, there is a graphic attacking creationism, which is quite a different thing. --<a href="/wiki/User:Michael_Johnson" title="User:Michael Johnson">Michael Johnson</a> 03:57, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>JPotter, you clearly have been paying zero attention to anything said by somebody besides yourself.  I'm not arguing that global warming doesn't exist.  I'm not even arguing that global warming isn't man-made.  I'm arguing that there clearly are scientists who agree with both sides of both questions.  An article about global warming that doesn't acknowledge the scientific community who disagrees with it, whether it total or in part, is de facto biased and needs to be fixed.  I apologize if this is so difficult to understand, but it's frustrating when people assign positions to me that I didn't take and do not share. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:JQLibet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JQLibet (page does not exist)">JQLibet</a> 04:26, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

The article treats as fact not only that global warming exists, but that it is likely attributable to humans.  There are several scientists who disagree, but no mention is made of them in the article.  Clear bias and a clear lack of understanding of the issues.

<p>There is a link on the article to that article. Given the small number of scientists involved it would be undue weight to give them greater emphisis.

<p>"Why, one might wonder, is there such insistence on scientific unanimity on the warming issue? After all, unanimity in science is virtually nonexistent on far less complex matters. Unanimity on an issue as uncertain as "global warming" would be surprising and suspicious. Moreover, why are the opinions of scientists sought regardless of their field of expertise?

<ul><li>From today's news (January 19, 2007): Joe D'Aleo, executive director of the International Climate and Environmental Change Assessment Project, a group of scientists, doesn't think greenhouse gas emissions are the major cause of global warming and climate change. "Greenhouse warming is real, but I think it is a relatively minor player," D'Aleo said. He claims other factors like solar activity and other natural causes are probably playing a greater role in rising temperatures -- a position that gets a mostly chilly reception from the crowd. D'Aleo said there was an element of peer pressure to toe the party line. "A lot of them are not willing to speak up because it might endanger grants and jobs," he said. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Arvin_Sloane&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Arvin Sloane (page does not exist)">Arvin Sloane</a> 09:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul><li>"The scientific community is largely in agreement on this issue, with little dissent" — this is not science, it's politics. This kind of argument shouldn't be allowed in Wikipedia. And my posts are not "unsigned", Mr. Connolley, my Hughes satellite Internet service assigns random roaming IP addresses (as I have explained to you before, haven't I?). All in all, nothing can hide the fact that this "Global Warming" article is extremely biased, and being aggressively protected by a group of self-appointed censors with a huge ax to grind. Shame on you. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Arvin_Sloane&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Arvin Sloane (page does not exist)">Arvin Sloane</a> 19:24, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Actually it is neither science nor politics, but just an atute observation by another editor. As for being biased, just present your sources to the contrary.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Now, it would seem, three people disagree that the article is neutral.  That's certainly sufficient to justify the placement of a POV tag indicating a neutrality dispute.  (Actually, one person engaging in a good faith dispute over neutrality is sufficient, but three certainly is.)  Removing a neutrality dispute tag when there is an ongoing neutrality dispute is plain vandalism, pure and simple, so I would counsel those who want to remove the tag to think long and hard before removing a factual tag from an article. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:CleanHarry29201&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:CleanHarry29201 (page does not exist)">CleanHarry29201</a> 05:02, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Note also this language from the NPOV policy: "Sometimes people have edit wars over the NPOV dispute tag, or have an extended debate about whether there is a NPOV dispute or not. In general, if you find yourself having an ongoing dispute about whether a dispute exists, there's a good chance one does, and you should therefore leave the NPOV tag up until there is a consensus that it should be removed."  That definitely applies here, and the POV tag is perfectly proper. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:CleanHarry29201&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:CleanHarry29201 (page does not exist)">CleanHarry29201</a> 05:05, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl><dd>In this case, however, the POV tags gets reverted as soon it is put up by you and there is no prolonged edit war where the POV tag is put up by spomeone removed by someone else, put back by someone else etc. etc. all day long.

<p>JQL makes essentially 2 points: one about the consensus (which is tediously familiar and will probably have the usual result) and the second about doom+catastrophe. HE also says, why will no-one discuss my arguments. Which is ironic, since he hasn't answered my:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>I disagree. The GW article should *not* speak about D+C. If if does, that needs to be fixed &amp; I will be happy to help. The intro sez </i>Other consequences include <b>higher</b> or lower agricultural yields, glacier retreat, reduced summer streamflows, species extinctions and increases in the ranges of disease vectors. Warming is expected to affect the number and magnitude of these events; however, it is difficult to connect particular events to global warming<i> (my emphasis on the higher). Do you think that list is unreasonable? </i>glacier retreat, reduced summer streamflows<i> is definitely reasonable. And I notice you omit the para immeadiately following your quote: </i>The extent and probability of these consequences is a matter of considerable uncertainty<i> - doesn't that answer much of your problem? I've weakened the THC bit.</i>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>As to the controversy: there is a link to it in the intro: <i>Remaining scientific uncertainties include the exact degree of climate change expected in the future, and especially how changes will vary from region to region across the globe.

<dl><dd>I'm sorry that you think that I'm apparently bound by whatever previous discussions you've had on the matter.  The fact that you have been able to browbeat and overwhelm previous discussion is of no import to someone who did not take part in it.  The fact remains that there is a verifiable scientific dispute, proven by other articles on this very wikipedia, as to the existence, causes, and ramifications of global warming.  Doom and catastrophe was an argument that you raised in response to my providing of evidence in support of the scientific dispute.  That quote came from a letter written by 60 scientists.  60.  I undertook to respond to your points by pointing out the varied and dramatic consequences listed on the <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a> page and expounded upon in the <a href="/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming" title="Effects of global warming">effects of global warming</a> article.  All of it goes to the singular issue and my singular argument: there is a dispute as to the neutrality of this article as defined by the Wikipedia policies.  Arguing about the existence of the dispute won't change that.  Ignoring it won't change that.  Stifling discussion won't change that.  This article deserves, nay requires, a POV tag.  Failing to put it up or removing it is in violation of the Wikipedia policies and the whole spirit of scentific debate.  Reasonable minds certainly differ on the myriad issues raised by global warming, and it is frankly insulting that you make no room for any other point of view besides your own.  That is the definition of bias. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:JQLibet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JQLibet (page does not exist)">JQLibet</a> 18:42, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I just checked out <a href="/wiki/User:William_M._Connolley" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a>'s page.  On it, he states: "I've mostly edited climate related pages, which is where most of my wiki-relevant expertise is.  I - the long-haired sandal-wearing weirdo-non-conformist - have been doing my best to staunchly defend (with logic, facts and reasoned arguments mostly) the orthodox line."  Even reading this as charitably as possible, Mr. Connolley, a self-described "climate modeller," publicly states that his goal is to "defend . . . the orthodox line" with respect to climate change.  That this is highly inappropriate is self-evident.  A Wikipedia editor with an axe to grind on a particular topic is nothing more than a cheap propaganda artist, and that appears to be Mr. Connolley's function in this debate.  I have no axe to grind and have no idea whether (a) global warming exists or (b) people are causing it.  I do know that there are plenty of experts and regular people on  both sides of both questions, but Mr. Connolley doesn't want anyone to know that, because it conflicts with the "orthodox line" that he's self-describedly sworn to defend.  I expect more from a Wikipedia admin.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:CleanHarry29201&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:CleanHarry29201 (page does not exist)">CleanHarry29201</a> 18:51, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>But by refusing to address my primary point, I gather that you concede it.

<p>After a period of relative stability this article is now undergoing lots of changes.  It's great that people are trying to improve the article but not all of the changes hang together. The intro, in particular, has become very disjointed.  So after making individual edits please take a step back and look at how your material affects the material around it.  If you see that things aren't flowing smoothly from one idea to the next, try to adjust sentence and paragraph structure so they do.

<dl><dd>Can I just add that this idea of stare decisis on Wikipedia runs against everything the site stands for.  Remember this: <a class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold_in_updating_pages">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold_in_updating_pages</a>&#160;?  I've now seen in several places, not just in the global warming context, the argument raised that "well, we've done this before a few times, and since we didn't change anything then, why change anything now."  Are the other editors so out of touch that I actually need to provide the historical examples showing how dangerous this line of thinking has proven to be?  Discussion and debate is something that needs to be encouraged in all its forms and for all time.  If an issue is raised by a new voice, simply responding that "we already argued about this" is unfair to the person with no opportunity to be heard in the discussion.  If he raises points that you've already heard and responded to, either copy and paste your response or direct him to it.  Then allow him the chance to counter your points.  If he raises new points, respond to them.  But just because an idea has languished on a page for months or years, does not make one whit of difference in whether or not to keep it if someone has a logical foundation for its removal. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:JQLibet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JQLibet (page does not exist)">JQLibet</a> 18:52, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Mr. Connolley, perhaps you should read what you just posted.  It says that improper removal of a POV tag is not "simple vandalism."  It doesn't say it's not vandalism, just that it's not the category of vandalism that is "simple."  And note that I have not violated 3RR with respect to placing a POV tag on this article.  I have conspicuously limited my placement of the tag well outside 3RR to avoid violating policy.  I, unlike many folks around here (including you) care very much about abiding by the policies of the Wikipedia.  And I reiterate, there is a good faith POV dispute ongoing with respect to global warming, and removing the POV tag under such circumstances is vandalism.  POV tags may only be removed when a dispute is settled (according to the link you JUST POSTED!), and this POV dispute is most assuredly not settled.  Every recent attempt by an editor to remove POV language has been instantly reverted by one of the clique that is, as a previous poster noted, attempting to improperly "own" this page in violation of Wikipedia policy. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:CleanHarry29201&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:CleanHarry29201 (page does not exist)">CleanHarry29201</a> 05:24, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I totally agree with CleanHarry29201. I'm new to Wiki, but this ridiculous clique that is attempting to exercise control of the page is acting disgracefully.

To claim that this article is 'finished' and can't be improved upon, is ludicrous. Either allow contributors to produce a balanced article giving <b>both</b> sides of the debate on Global Warming, or split the article into two separate articles (see my earlier comment). <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Grimerking&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Grimerking (page does not exist)">Grimerking</a> 22:47, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Global_warming_another_viewpoint">Global warming another viewpoint</span></h2>
<p>I suggest that every one that is talking about global warming today would realize that the term, “warming” changes the topic from just talk to a discussion of energy.
</p><p>The energy guru of all times was Sir Isaac Newton who lived in the seventeenth century. His work was and still is the authority on questions of energy of all kinds. Any one talking global warning should do a google search on energy forms and learn what they are talking about.
</p><p>In his work he stated that almost all energy on earth is or was furnished by the sun. He also stated that energy is conserved meaning that it does not dissipate or diminish. It has been stacking up for at least four million years and our scientific community should answer the question, “where did it go?” before we buy the story that something that we are doing is having a negative effect on the ozone and causing global warming.
</p><p>I believe that this daily layer of energy is absorbed as heat and has been radiating to the center of the earth for four million years and melting rock. There is no other place with that much stored energy on earth.
</p><p>I also believe that the coefficient of expansion of the crust of the earth being warmed from below causes pressure that causes upheavals that they call "mountains caused by earth quakes." These mountains even look like the upheavals in our roadways caused by summer heat and the coefficient of expansion of the road material but on a larger scale.
</p><p>When there is a fault such as a break the pressure that caused the break sets the broken piece of the crust in motion away from the break floating on the magma. The kinetic energy or energy of motion initiated by the momentary impulse caused by the break is equal to the weight of the land mass times it’s velocity squared. I believe also that the magma gets bigger and the crust gets thinner with time and the earth tends to swell as the suns heat builds up because of it‘s coefficient of expansion.
</p><p>Thus I believe that global warming is a non man made fact that we can’t do a thing about. However, it has been happening for four million plus years and I have no real reason to run and hide yet.
</p><p>I have been in the engineering field all of my working career and would welcome discussion as to the possible feasibility of these statements from the scientific field.

<dl><dd>Well, Newton was a great scientist, but not a great expert on energy. Thermodynamics as a field was in its very infancy during his lifetime. You suggestion is not compatible with current physics. The Earth, as any body not at absolute zero, is radiating energy as per the <a href="/wiki/Stefan-Boltzmann_law" class="mw-redirect" title="Stefan-Boltzmann law">Stefan-Boltzmann law</a>. Intake and outflow very nearly match, or it would have melted long ago.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Stephan, You surprise me.

By the way did you know there was a Flanders and Swann song on the Second Law of Thermodynamics?

<dl><dd>Actually, it was in the context of inflow and outflow of radiation. I don't have the exact numbers handy, but the net difference is so small that it is normally ignored in most models. Solar inflow (averaged over all earth surface) is about 342 Watts per m^2), and I seem to remember that radioactive decay is at least 3 orders of magnitude smaller.--<a href="/wiki/User:Stephan_Schulz" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 12:28, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Attempt_to_Gauge_Consensus">Attempt to Gauge Consensus</span></h2>
<p>The Global Warming page has clearly been undergoing a bit of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EW" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EW">edit warring</a> recently pertaining to whether the page is presenting a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. Because of this contention, I've just spent about six hours reading through these <a href="/wiki/Talk:Global_Warming" class="mw-redirect" title="Talk:Global Warming">Talk:Global Warming</a> pages to try to determine what the overall views of <a href="/wiki/Global_Warming" class="mw-redirect" title="Global Warming">Global Warming</a> contributors are.
</p><p>The contributors seem to fall fairly cleanly into two camps: those who seem like they probably agree with most or all of the following statements, and those who seem like they probably disagree with most or all of the following statements:
</p><p>1) The average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans has increased in the last half century.
</p><p>2) The majority of the recent temperature increase is attributable to human activities.
</p><p>3) The Global Warming page is adequately neutral as is, and doesn't warrant a POV tag.
</p><p>4) The Global Warming page would be better off without making changes that give even more credence to the minority viewpoint, such as replacing the initial "Global warming is the observed increase in ..." with "Global warming is the allegedly observed and theorized increase in ...."
</p><p>Among the 47 contributors who have made changes to this talk page between January 1 and this post, inclusive, I think the 36 following users would agree with most or all of the the above statements: 67.176.43.144, Amatulic, AstroHurricane001, Atlant, bikeable, BozMo, Calibas, Candy, Chris Gonzalez, Chrisnumbers2000, Count Iblis, Dan Pangburn, David.atwell, Eric, h2g2bob, HughGRex, Jacqueslacansan, Jcc1, j e r s y k o, JPotter, KarlBunker, Kamope, Lesikar, Mac Davis, Michael Johnson, MrRedact, Narssarssuaq, Ninarosa, Raymond Arritt, RyGuy, sbandrews, Sm8900, Specusci, Stephan Schulz, TeaDrinker, William M.

<dl><dd>You're tying unrelated opinions together and, intentionally or unintentionally, distracting from the actual issue. It doesn't matter at all which of us or how many agree with 1, for instance. (For the record, I rate it as probably (&gt;90% chance) true, and I'd suspect anyone that flat out says it's not true doesn't know what they're talking about. So yes, you misrepresented me badly above, but more importantly you erred in your choice of categories to begin with.) The point is having an NPOV article. That doesn't mean the editors vote about what the truth is, and then the article tells the reader what the truth is. That means that the article should, in a neutral tone and scrupulously avoiding emotive language and rhetorical tricks, describe the work that has been done, the data that has been recorded, the interpretations of that data that have been proposed, the arguments that have been advanced for and against those interpretations. And that is what it fails to do, and what many of the editors here will never willingly allow it to do.

<dd>Just to make it very clear what I'm getting at - the point is that it doesn't matter if you can show a supermajority of editors in favour of a POV article - policy *still* requires it to be NPOV. <a href="/wiki/User:Arker" title="User:Arker">Arker</a> 02:44, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The article is reasonably close to NPOV.  The only significant problem is that it devotes <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV#Undue_weight" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">excessive attention</a> to fringe views such as those of Svensmark. <a href="/wiki/User:Raymond_arritt" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 03:12, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Please, try to be serious. One study is mentioned in passing, in a single sentence in a 57 kilobyte article, and you say that's giving undue weight to minority views?

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>My copy of the Oxford English Dictionary defines "fringe" as "not part of the mainstream; unconventional."  That's an accurate and NPOV assessment of Svensmark's findings.

<p>It looks like the majority viewpoint is held by about 77% of the current set of editors on this page (36/47).  That's well into the 60%-80% range that is typically used to establish a
<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CONS#Consensus_vs._supermajority" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CONS">supermajority</a> on Wikipedia, when a supermajority is used instead of a consensus.
</p><p>I'm hesitant to do an actual poll, in part because I think it'd be hard to do a poll that didn't suffer from problems such as <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SOCK" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SOCK">sock puppetry</a> and vote stacking, and in part because we're officially supposed to try to find a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CONS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CONS">consensus</a> through discussion rather than <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PNSD" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:PNSD">voting</a>.
</p><p>Hopefully this little analysis will be useful somehow, instead of just contributing to divisiveness. For one thing, it seems like it should at least help dispel any notion that the reason that the "global warming isn't real" idea isn't given more weight is just because the Global Warming article is being controlled by a little clique.  It may be true that some editors here are a lot more active than others, but it looks like the more active editors here are in general more or less just reflecting the opinions of the large majority.
</p><p>Another interesting observation is that even though there apparently only currently exists <a href="/wiki/List_of_scientists_opposing_global_warming_consensus" class="mw-redirect" title="List of scientists opposing global warming consensus">one scientist</a> who thinks that the Earth isn't even getting warmer, there seem to be several current editors here who hold that opinion, even though there are vastly more scientists than there are current editors on this page. Assuming that scientists are on average more likely to have an accurate viewpoint about global warming than the average editor here is, it seems like these anomalous ratios just might be a clue that this global warming stuff is for real.

<dd>Okay, here are a few comments. (1) As a regular reader of the daily telegraph (I had already read these articles) I would not agree that it is "well respected for its factual output within the UK", or at least it commands no particular respect for "factual output" (try reading the health food sections). In addition, it is very well recognised by all its readers (as for many papers) that when it deliberately invites a "leader" by a named author it does so to try to stir up contraversy not to express its own view. (2) A popular newspaper with some respondents who state they are scientists does not amount to any kind of review or survey of scientific opinion (3) The article itself isn't written in a serious or considered matter, it is a superficial tirade; there are plenty of personal attacks and mis-quotes. That's ok for the Telegraph but not for Wikipedia. IF there is a serious scientific view along the lines of the ones expressed in this article then the author should attempt to publish it in a serious scientific forum. Then, I would be inclined to include it. --<a href="/wiki/User:BozMo" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:BozMo" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 14:36, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Peak Oil like Global Warming means different things to different people, and like global warming suffers from changes in consensus view over the last decade being lagged by people and publications catching up. Personally, I don't think the Wikipedia article on Peak Oil is nearly as up to date as the Global Warming one (and its SO long I haven't got the energy to work on it). I would suggest you read the <a href="/wiki/Stern_Review" title="Stern Review">Stern Review</a> which concludes that oil is not going to run out soon enough to save major effects from global warming either directly (can't burn what you don't have) or indirectly (can't burn what you are too poor to afford). --<a href="/wiki/User:BozMo" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:BozMo" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 13:53, 26 January 2007MWP and LIA in IPCC reports]]</dd></dl>
<p>I took out:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>Fossil fuels are created over millions of years and for all practical purposes there is a limited store of every fossil fuel. One of the major contributors to global warming is believed to be CO2 from burning fossil fuel and therefore the ultimate quantity of CO2 capable of being released into the atmosphere is capped by the total quantity of fossil fuel.</i></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Just as there is considerable debate about global warming, there are a number of predictions of fossil fuel availibility and therefore a great uncertainty over the rate at which CO2 from fossil fuels will be released into the atmosphere. However, the timescales for global warming and fossil fuel depletion are similar with both being modelled over a period of several decades or centuries and as such models on global warming use various scenarios:</dd></dl>
<ul><li>Global warming is constrained mainly by inter-government agreement to cut fossil fuel use.</li>
<li>Global warming is not constrained and fossil fuels continue to be freely burnt.</li>
<li>Global warming is constrained by the limited availability of fossil fuel.<i></i></li></ul>
<p>As far as I'm aware, no-one in the mainstream expects GW to be significantly constrained by lack of things to burn, so peak oil is of limited relevance to this article. It currently has a link from the intro and that seems sufficient (remember article bloat) <a href="/wiki/User:William_M._Connolley" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 15:02, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Perhaps the only certainty that exists with global warming is that if as most people believe the main contributor is CO2 then it is quite obviously self limited by the quantity of fossil fuel. I know many in the Global warming lobby would like to bury this fact, but in the interests of balance the article should cover this very basic issue. If you would like to add to the issue your comments then it will only improve the article but to remove them altogether strikes me of the worst kind of deceit!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>This section is needed to make sure that those reading the article are aware that there is an upper limit to CO2 output which under some models will be the limiting factor (in fact given the way politicians treat the subject - it is more than likely this is the only limit!)</dd>

<dd>This needs to be based on the available science. If you look through IPCC/SRES, I don't think you'll find anything about running out of carbon, only substituting. There is plenty of coal to burn if the oil ends, and tar sands. The text you have added is sourceless, vague and totally non-numeric. <i>Just as there is considerable debate about global warming</i> - what does this mean? If you mean "over the science", then no - see the intro, etc., <i>there are a number of predictions of fossil fuel availibility</i> - a number? yes: there is the mainstream view that there is quite enough C; and there is the "peak oil" enthusiasts - and that only applies to oil <i>and therefore a great uncertainty over the rate at which CO2 from fossil fuels will be released into the atmosphere</i> - there is indeed uncertainty, but the mainstream view is that the uncertainty comes from economic scenarios of growth, not peak oil. <i>Although most predictions for global assume unlimited availability of fossil fuel, in reality</i> - not acceptable: you seem to be implying that although the predictions are X, in your reality Y is true - <i>there is also great concern over the future availability of key fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and even coal</i> - no; AFAIK coal is nearly unlimited, at least for the purposes of filling the atmos with CO2 - <i>; some experts even suggesting that fossil fuel availability is already in decline</i>. - may be true for oil, but coal availability is clearly not declining -  <i>As the timescales for global warming and fossil fuel depletion are similar, it is impossible to discount fossil fuel availability as a potential limit on global warming.</i> - if this article is to list all the things that are "impossible to discount" we'll be here forever. <i>Ironically, declining oil resources could also potentially result in a temporary increase in CO2 output, if as is expected, oil is derived from coal in processes which themselves liberate CO2 in addition to that derived from burning the oil.</i> true, but already built into the SRES I should expect <a href="/wiki/User:William_M._Connolley" title="User:William M.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Dear M.Connolley, unless CO2 does not cause global warming, it is a no brainer that all global warming models are eventually limited by the availability of fossil fuel. I don't know why you are trying to hide this fact - but I can guess from the comments about lack of neutrality of the article.</dd>
<dd>Peak oil is an article covering not only oil but coal and it refers to other limited sources. I know it is not liked by the global warming lobby because they don't like the idea that global warming may be self-limiting. However, I could see your point if I were replacing the whole article with one on peak oil - but otherwise you must include something on peak oil to retain the balance otherwise it is clearly biased with the assumption that "fossil fuel will increase exponentially" .... which to be blunt is a stupid assumption.</dd>
<dd>I'll accept your point in the unlikely event that you can show that the worst peak oil prediction does not constrain global warming - in which case there is no need, but otherwise I think you'll find that all global warming scenarious if run long enough will find that they end when fossil fuels are fully depleted.</dd>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I do not think the lowest competant forecasts of fossil fuel (as opposed odd articles by journalists who do not know what reserve means) offer any real limits to greenhouse gas production until CO2 levels have risen to at least several times todays level: say to 2000 ppm for sake of argument versus 375 (or whatever it now is). The climatic implications by then are so serious everyone assumes or hopes this won't happen.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Furthermore... anytime you are down to asserting that your argument is a "no brainer" then its probably time to stop and wonder if you're talking about the same things. In this case, we're not. *Eventually* we will run out of fossil fuels if we keep burning them - but thats not the point. The timespan covered in the page and most GW debates is "to 2100". It is far from a "no brainer" that we will run out by then; indeed it is very unlikely. If you think that all the SRES scenarios are implausible, then I thik you're wrong, but the palce to start such a discussionwould be on <a href="/wiki/SRES" class="mw-disambig" title="SRES">SRES</a> not here.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Mr Connonlly - you have just proved my point: "The timespan covered in the page and most GW debates is "to 2100". The timescale being considered for peak oil is 2007 at the lastest 2010. Peak coal is from memory around 40 years after peak oil which puts both well within your self set timescale of 2100. I really don't know why you are being so rediculous. The world's oil reserves are nearing empty, I don't think anyone is seriously saying that global warming will not be limited by fossil fuel depletion. If you have a serious analysis of the subject then lets see it otherwise I think you don't have a leg to stand on! <a href="/wiki/User:Haseler" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 17:15, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Mr BozMo, are you trying to tell me that CO2 output will be unaffected by peak oil? I used to have some respect for the global warming lobby - afterall it is a serious problem, but this encounter seems to show a lot of biggotry and unwillingless to listen to other views (ironic isn't it) I've personally realised that governments don't have the willpower to consider the kind of cuts that would be necessary for a 50% reduction in CO2. However, when I look at the peak oil argument I see potential reduction of CO2 by possibly more than 50% by 2050. Readers of wikipedia ought to have at least an introduction in global warming to this issue which is more fully developed in peak oil. The peak oil argument is clearly one based on a model of economically available fossil fuel. Clearly very different from your own figures which include every possible fossil fuel reserve irrespective of whether it is energy efficient to take it out. E.g. Oil shales are only economically viable if you employ natural gas and the energy taken out is probably less than that put in. <a href="/wiki/User:Haseler" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 17:23, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>(Edit conflicts galore) I've taken it out again. I could remotely unserstand adding it to the "related issues" section, but, given that the article always tends to get bigger, the current link in "see also" and the link in the introduction should suffice. As long as there is no reliable external source on the <i>link</i> (not on peak oil), everything more would violate <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR">WP:OR</a>. And rightly, I'd say. If the peak theories are correct (and they are <i>not</i> mainstream), we still have no good predictions on the amount and shape of overall emissions.

<p>Dear Connolley, I will try not to shout, but you are making me very irate. There are two articles, both dealing with the problems caused by energy supply. It still is a no brainer that this article must link to the other (and vica versa) I didn't write the peak oil aricle, I'm not trying to defend it as such I just created a quick summary using the facts there and put a link to it. If the facts I've written are wrong then you clearly ought first to make changes to the peak oil article where there are some who can argue the toss with you. If however you dispute the facts, then again you ought to check the peak oil article and make sure that it adequately notes contrary points of view (if you can source them) - but that does not in itself negate the need for the link. But on your specific point - its a bit rich having someone complain about peak oil which has a proven record of making at least some verifiable predictions within a few years when Global warming is still at the stage of a 3:1 range between lowest and highest predictions! <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:88.110.38.52&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:88.110.38.52 (page does not exist)">88.110.38.52</a> 22:39, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Who are you? LR or H? I've pointed out that the graph on which the peak coal prediction is based is clearly useless - the fit is so bad as to be laughable.

I can understand the differences between different types of oil reserve and given that for the last three decades the real terms cost (corrected for steel cost) of extracting fossil fuel from any given location/geology has fallen about 3% a year, I think there is a very high likelihood that much of what is currently marginal will become economic well before 2100.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>My sole interest was to have a link to the article on peak oil. As a scientist and engineer with many years experience in renewables, the article is not only very interesting but clearly relevant to anyone involved in global warming. My own personal view is that resource scarcity will have a much larger impact than any government action (primarily because government's aren't really proposing to do very much). At the very least the phrase "if we do nothing", which premises most global warming predictions must itself be limited by the availability of fossil fuel. From reflecting on the comments, it seems to be there are two fundamentally opposed ways of viewing fossil fuel resource: 1. That every resource can potentially add to global warming (runaway global warming). 2. That economical supply of fossil fuel is close to exhaustion (peak oil). These are two very different views of the same problem. What I find almost incredible is the hostility from certain individuals who will not even entertain the possibility that fossil fuel is practically limited - a bit ironic since that is quite clearly the attitude that got us into this problem in the first place. <a href="/wiki/User:LordsReform" title="User:LordsReform">LordsReform</a> 14:31, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Oh for the days when those talking about global warming were spoken of in the same disparaging tones. Why do you persist with the absurd idea that fossil fuel supply is limitless? Do you believe any of the world's resources are practically limited - <b>do you even believe that the ability of the earth's atmosphere to soak up CO2 is limited</b> - I seriously doubt it! At the end of the day, it really matters little whether you do or do not believe - government action is incapable of the level of CO2 reduction necessary to put any real limit on CO2 emissions. Therefore whatever you want to believe fossil fuels will run out manmade control has any substantial effect and therefore fossil fuel supply will be the only substantial curb on global warming. If you believe it is 2200 - then so much the worse for the world. Based on the best evidence I can find I estimate a substantial reduction in CO2 starting as early as 2030. My only interest is reading this article was to find out what this would mean for the peak temperature rise. Instead, this debate has only led me to seriously question the motives behind those who label as "heretics" those who question whether there will be a natural limit to global warming. <a href="/wiki/User:LordsReform" title="User:LordsReform">LordsReform</a> 14:31, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
