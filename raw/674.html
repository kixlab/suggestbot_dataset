			<p>The Spanish philosopher George Santayana wrote, “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” When it comes to climate change, repeating the past is a luxury we can’t afford. If partisan politics continues to derail policy or if denial continues to win over science, it will mean irreversible changes to our planet. Future generations will look at ours as the one that didn’t have the courage to act, rather than the one that recognized the fierce urgency of the moment and met it head on.</p>

			<p>With this in mind, we’ve created a climate change timeline highlighting the evolution of science, the intrusion of denial, and the sluggishness of policy over the past 200 years. Let’s learn from the mistakes of the past, so we can make tomorrow a brighter—but not hotter—future.</p>

						<h4>Observable changes in the Earth</h4>
						<span>since the industrial revolution</span>
						<p>While politicians have been busy debating the merits of climate science, the physical symptoms of climate change have become increasingly apparent: since the industrial revolution, sea level has grown by 0.9 inches, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen to unprecedented levels, average global temperatures have increased by about 1.0 degree Celsius and, to top it off, the global population has jumped by nearly 600 percent; <a target="_blank" href="http://climate.nasa.gov/news/2391/">15 of the 16 hottest years</a> on record occurred in the 21st century, and 2016 is likely to be the warmest year ever recorded. The graphs included in this timeline serve to show how the Earth has changed over the past 200 years.</p>

			                <p>President Obama unveils the final version of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate-change">Clean Power Plan</a>, which aims to reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 32.0% from 2005 levels by 2030. In December, <b>196 countries come together at the Paris Climate Change Conference to sign <a target="_blank" href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09.pdf">the Paris Agreement</a></b>, which pledges to limit rising temperatures “well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius."</p>

Still, the agreement has built in mechanisms to ratchet up emissions cuts in 2020, which means that emissions cuts might very well increase in the next few years, and the deal does contain some binding elements, such as requiring that all countries participate in a system to measure the progress of their INDC goals. The bottom line is that the Paris Agreement goes much farther in addressing the problem of climate change than the global community ever has before.</blockquote>

		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>The presidential election this November, and the naming of a new <a target="_blank" href="http://grist.org/climate-energy/scalias-death-means-obamas-clean-power-plan-is-more-likely-to-succeed/">Supreme Court Justice</a> will be critical in determining how the battle against climate change progresses in the first half of the 21st century. If policy continues to lag, we may find ourselves to be too late to curb emissions and keep the planet’s warming below 2 degrees Celsius. The answer is simple: we know our history, so let’s make sure we don’t repeat it.</p>
