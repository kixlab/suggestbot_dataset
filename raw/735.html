<div align="center" class="style1">Solubility   </div>
<p>The definition of solubility is the maximum quantity of solute that can dissolve in a certain quantity of   solvent or quantity of solution at a specified temperature or pressure (in the case of gaseous solutes). In CHM1045 we discussed solubility as a yes or no quality. But the reality is that almost every solute is somewhat soluble in every solvent to some measurable degree. </p>
<p>As stated in the definition, temperature and pressure play an important role in determining the degree to which a solute is soluble. </p>
<p><strong>Let's start with temperature:</strong></p>
<p><strong>For Gases</strong>, solubility decreases as temperature increases (duh...you have seen water boil, right?) The physical reason for this is that when most gases dissolve in solution, the process is exothermic. This means that heat is released as the gas dissolves. This is very   similar to the reason that vapor pressure increases with temperature. Increased   temperature causes an increase in kinetic energy. The higher kinetic energy   causes more motion in the gas molecules which break intermolecular bonds and escape from   solution. Check out the graph below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="174solublegas.gif" alt="Gas Solubility" width="340" height="357" /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the temperature increases, the solubility of a gas decreases as shown by   the downward trend in the graph.</p>
<p><strong>For solid or liquid solutes</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>CASE I: Decrease in solubility with temperature:</strong></p>
<p>If the heat given off in the dissolving process is greater than the heat   required to break apart the solid, the net dissolving reaction is exothermic   (See the <a href="solnprocess.html"><strong>solution process</strong></a>). The addition of more heat (increases temperature) inhibits   the dissolving reaction since excess heat is already being produced by the   reaction. This situation is not very common where an increase in temperature   produces a decrease in solubility. But is the case for sodium sulfate and calcium hydroxide. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="solubility.jpg" alt="Salt Solubility" width="314" height="442" /></p>
<p><strong>CASE II: Increase in solubility with temperature:</strong></p>
<p>If the heat given off in the dissolving reaction is less than the heat   required to break apart the solid, the net dissolving reaction is endothermic. The addition of more heat facilitates the dissolving reaction   by providing energy to break bonds in the solid. This is the most common   situation where an increase in temperature produces an increase in solubility   for solids.</p>
<p>The use of first-aid instant cold packs is an application of this solubility   principle. A salt such as ammonium nitrate is dissolved in water after a sharp   blow breaks the containers for each. The dissolving reaction is endothermic -   requires heat. Therefore the heat is drawn from the surroundings, the pack feels   cold. </p>
<p>The effect of temperature on solubility   can be explained on the basis of <strong>Le Chatelier's   Principle</strong>. Le   Chatelier's Principle states that if a stress (for example, heat, pressure,   concentration of one reactant) is applied to an equilibrium, the system will adjust, if   possible, to minimize the effect of the stress. &nbsp;This principle is of value in   predicting how much a system will respond to a change in external conditions. &nbsp;Consider the   case where the solubility process is endothermic (heat added). An increase in temperature puts a stress on the   equilibrium condition and causes it to shift to the right. &nbsp;The stress is relieved because the   dissolving process consumes some of the heat. Therefore, &nbsp;the &nbsp;solubility &nbsp;(concentration)   &nbsp;increases &nbsp;with &nbsp;an &nbsp;increase &nbsp;in &nbsp;temperature. &nbsp; &nbsp;If &nbsp;the   process is exothermic (heat given   off). A   temperature rise will decrease the solubility by shifting the equilibrium to the   left.</p>

<p><strong>Now let's look at pressure: </strong></p>
<p>Solids and liquids show almost no change in solubility with changes in pressure. But gases are very dependent on the pressure of the system. Gases dissolve in liquids to form solutions. This dissolution is an   equilibrium process for which an equilibrium constant can be written. For   example, the equilibrium between oxygen gas and dissolved oxygen in water is   O<sub>2</sub>(aq) &lt;=&gt; O<sub>2</sub>(g). The equilibrium constant for this equilibrium is K =   p(O<sub>2</sub>)/c(O<sub>2</sub>). The form of the equilibrium constant shows that the concentration   of a solute gas in a solution is directly proportional to the partial pressure   of that gas above the solution. This statement, known as <strong>Henry's   law</strong>, was first proposed in 1800 by J.W. Henry as an empirical law well   before the development of our modern ideas of chemical equilibrium. </p>

<p>The inverse of the Henry's law constant, multiplied by the partial pressure of   the gas above the solution, is the <strong>molar solubility</strong> of the gas.   Thus oxygen at one atmosphere would have a molar solubility of (1/756.7)mol/dm<sup>3</sup>   or 1.32 mmol/dm<sup>3</sup>. Values in this table are calculated from tables of molar thermodynamic   properties of <a href="http://dwb.unl.edu/Teacher/NSF/C09/C09Links/www.chem.ualberta.ca/courses/plambeck/p101/p00403.htm" target="_blank">pure substances</a> and <a href="http://dwb.unl.edu/Teacher/NSF/C09/C09Links/www.chem.ualberta.ca/courses/plambeck/p101/p00404.htm" target="_blank">aqueous solutes</a></p>

<div id="section">
  <div><strong>Summary of Factors Affecting Solubility </strong></div>
  <div>Normally, solutes become more soluble in a given solvent at   higher temperatures. One way to predict that trend is to use Le Chatelier's   principle. Because <span class="style2">D</span>Hsoln is positive for   most solutions, the solution formation reaction is usually endothermic.   Therefore, when the temperature is increased, the solubility of the solute   should also increase. However, there are solutes that do not follow the normal   trend of increasing solubility with increasing temperature. One class of solutes   that becomes less soluble with increasing temperature is the gasses. Nearly   every gas becomes less soluble with increasing temperature. </div>
  <div>Another property of gaseous solutes in summarized by   Henry's law  which predicts that gasses become more soluble when   their pressures above a liquid solution are increased. That property of gaseous   solutes can be rationalized by using Le Chatelier's principle. Imagine that you   have a glass of water inside of a sealed container filler with nitrogen gas. If   the size of that container were suddenly halved, the pressure of nitrogen would   suddenly double. To decrease the pressure of nitrogen above the solution (as is   required by Le Chatelier's principle), more nitrogen gas becomes dissolved in   the glass of water. </div>
