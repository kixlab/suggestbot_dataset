## ABSTRACT

The hydatidiform mole (HM) is a placental pathology of androgenetic origin.
Placental villi have an abnormal hyperproliferation event and hydropic
degeneration. Three situations can be envisaged at its origin: 1. The
destruction/expulsion of the female pronucleus at the time of fertilization by
1 or 2 spermatozoa with the former being followed by an endoreplication of the
male pronucleus leading to a complete hydatidiform mole (CHM) 2. A triploid
zygote (fertilization by 2 spermatozoa) leading to a partial hydatidiform mole
(PHM) but can also lead to haploid and diploid clones. The diploid clone may
produce a normal fetus while the haploid clone after endoreplication generates
a CHM 3. A nutritional defect during the differentiation of the oocytes or the
deterioration of the limited oxygen pressure during the first trimester of
gestation may lead to the formation of a HM.

In countries with poor medical health care system, moles (mainly the CHM) can
become invasive or, in rare cases, lead to gestational choriocarcinomas.

**KEYWORDS:** choriocarcinoma, epigenetic, fertilization, hydatidiform mole,
invasive mole, trophoblast

## Introduction

In humans, 5-6 d post conception, the zygote gradually becomes a blastocyst.
The peripheral cells of this blastocyst differentiate into 2 layers: a
cellular trophoblast called the cytotrophoblast (CTB) and an expanding
peripheral syncytial layer, the syncytiotrophoblast (STB), which then invades
the endometrium and uterine vasculature (Fig. 1). These two tissues associated
with the extra-embryonic mesoderm are at the origin of the placenta. When the
proliferation/invasion phenomena are not well controlled, the trophoblast
cells can give rise to a rare complication of pregnancy known as a
hydatidiform mole (complete or partial). These hydatidiform moles belong to
the gestational trophoblastic diseases of which represent the most common
pathologies. These are the only pathologies of the group that can be recurrent
in the same patient. The recurrent moles are a rarer occurrence and indicate a
genetic predisposition. These tumors are also the only ones of androgenetic
origin. In other words, the tumor cells do not have the alleles of the ovule
which has been fertilized, contrary to all the other cells of the woman
carrying this anomaly. Parthenogenesis but not androgenesis was observed in
primates1 and partial moles (and not complete mole) was observed in
chimpanzee, but the invasive forms were only found to exist in humans.2

## Anatomy and histology

### Description

The moles were first described by Hippocrates (470-410 BC) who explained their
formation through the consumption of dirty water by the pregnant women, where
the water originates from the marshes. However, the terms mole and
hydatidiform were later employed by William Smelie (1752). This author
describes this pathology as a bunch of grapes consisting of different
sizes.3,4 The moles exhibit diffuse trophoblastic hyperplasia where the
structures of villosities are particularly aberrant and hydropic (Fig. 1).
Such disorganization of the trophoblast, results in the limited recognition of
the presence of vascular structures.5 The problem of vascular maturation in
the moles could be due to the increased level of apoptosis in the precursor
components of the blood-vessels6 or to the defective recruitment of pericytes
around the villous stromal vessels.7 Despite the presence of these vessels, it
is not certain that they contain various haematopoietic components. This
persistent vascular immaturity of the villous stroma could lead to hydropic
villi mainly in CHM. In the case of PHM, these trophoblastic anomalies are
less present and usually contain identifiable embryonic or fetal tissues,
which is very infrequent in the case of the CHM.8 Surprisingly, this
trophoblastic hyperplasia can continue to form to such an extent whereby it
invades and subsequently exceeds the uterine cavity (Fig. 1). This observation
suggests that these moles are not rejected by the uterus. Some authors could
regard it as a missed abortion.9 In the Middle Ages one imagined that each
focal swelling corresponded to an egg. Hertig and his colleagues in 195610
proposed a logical progression between the various types of moles, from PHM to
CHM then to an invasive mole, followed by a very aggressive tumor, the
choriocarcinoma. Today, it is known that it is not plausible, in particular
because a woman can develop a choriocarcinoma after a HM but also after a
normal pregnancy.11,12 It is more pertinent to speak of preneoplasia
(premalignant) for the HM and of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia
(malignant diseases) for the invasive moles and the choriocarcinomas.13

### Differentiation

The cells of the CTB actively proliferate immediately after implantation and
invade the endometrium and the spiral arteries in a regulated manner, allowing
the plugging of these vessels (Fig. 2). On the surface of villi the CTB cells
generate, by asymmetrical cell division, the multinucleated
syncytiotrophoblasts (STB) (Fig. 2). This STB loses any pre-existing mitotic
activity and it is very sensitive to the presence of oxygen. The STB secretes
numerous hormones, such as human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). The CTB cell
proliferation is responsible of the production of 2 types of mature villi
which are; floating and anchoring villi (Fig. 3). The proliferation is faster
in the center of the placenta when compared to the periphery.14 The plugging
of the trophoblastic cells avoids the teratogenic effect of too high oxygen
pressure (pO2) in the embryo. During the 10-12 first weeks of the gestation,
the STB does not secrete antioxidant enzymes. Conversely, this hypoxia
supports placenta angiogenesis and the proliferation of the CTB cells.15
Around 10 weeks of gestation, the trophoblastic plugs are dissolved and the
progressive maternal spiral arteries remodel into large diameter vessels
(utero-placental arteries), which are responsible for the increased level of
blood flow (Fig. 3). The maternal blood can now circulate easily between the
villi, supply required nutrients from the mother to the fetus and eliminate
the toxic elements from the fetus. These modifications occur in parallel to
the significant growth of the fetus. During gestation, the CTB decreases in
thickness at term, the STB is in close contact with placental vessels allowing
efficient nutrient uptake by the fetus.5

Placental development and its regulations according to pO2 variations. During
the first trimester the plugging ("plug") of the arteries, generates weak pO2.
The variations of pO2 induce a modification of different molecule synthesis,
which supports the transition, spatially and temporally, from the
proliferation phase to the differentiation phase of the trophoblast at the end
of the first trimester and the remodeling of the arteries.

### Regulators

The utero-placental regulators are organized at an early stage of pregnancy
and correspond to a dialog between maternal cells (decidual cells, NK cells,
macrophages) and trophoblastic cells. This effective dialog limits, in space
and in time, the proliferation and invasion of extravillous CTB, respectively,
to one third of the internal myometrium and until the 16th week of
gestation.16 The hypoxic environment of the first trimester of pregnancy
promotes the cellular proliferation of trophoblast and avoids oxidative
stress, the alteration of the villi and inhibits the differentiation of
extravillous trophoblast to the invasive phenotype. This hypoxic environment
is maintained for approximately 10 weeks of gestation. After this stage, the
pO2 increases and the placenta phenotype becomes invasive, allowing the
remodelling of the spiral arteries; leading to increased blood perfusion of
the placenta (Fig. 3). Any deviations in these regulators (pO2 or/and
trophoblast response), results in the placenta developing a proliferative
phenotype; a situation that could be the cause of one of the histological
aspects of molar pregnancies.

These regulators are controlled by a number of factors present in the
trophoblast, such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α),17 and in the
decidua, such as transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and Decorin.18 The
expression of transcription factor HIF1α is high during the early stages of
pregnancy and decreases after 9 weeks of gestation, when pO2 begins to
increase.17 Under reduced pO2, the trophoblast cells activate HIF1α, which in
turn upregulates TGFβ expression.17 The TGFβ and Decorin subsequently inhibit
the growth, migration and invasion of extravillous trophoblast.16 However, the
neoplasic placenta resists the negative regulations of TGFβ. This resistance
may be related to the decreased expression of tissue inhibitors of
metalloproteinases (TIMPs).19 Other factors such as Leukemia Inhibitory Factor
(LIF), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3(STAT3) and specific
integrins are expressed with increasing pO2 and promote invasion. STAT3
activation is necessary for the invasive phenotype of trophoblastic cells and
can be controlled via LIF. LIF provides a soluble extracellular signal that
stimulates trophoblast invasion.20 Thus, CTB cells present a dynamic
expression of certain adhesion molecules (integrins, E-cadherin) depending on
the oxygen pressure.21-23 Authors show that, when the placenta transforms from
the proliferative phase to the differentiation phase, the trophoblastic cells
switch their expression of specific integrins (α6/β4 to α1/β1 and α5/β1),
which is also associated with a decreased expression of the E-cadherin (Fig.
3). If the CTB cells do not adopt the required cell adhesions, cell
proliferation is favored over invasion.22 This transition to the invasive
phenotype of trophoblast is also very dependent on the expression of the
canonical Wnt pathway associated with the expression of transcription factor
4(TCF-4) and with the recruitment of β-catenin.24 The hyperactivation of the
Wnt pathway and nuclear expression of β-catenin are involved in the formation
of hydatidiform moles.25 At the time of the trophoblastic transition, a
differential expression of growth factor receptors is also observed. Epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) and erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene
homolog 4 (ERBB4) are expressed in the proliferative phenotype while ERBB2 and
3 are expressed in the invasive phenotype (Fig. 3). These receptors are
activated by EGF and heparin binding EGF (HB-EGF) solely throughout the
proliferative phase. In the case of CHM, there is an increase in the
expression of the EGFR, which may explain the hyperplasia of the
trophoblast.26 The invasive trophoblast also produces proteases (specifically
MMP2 and MMP9) that degrade the proteins of the extracellular matrix in the
decidua, which in turn would facilitate the invasion. We can also observe the
expression of inhibitors of these proteases as TIMPs and plasminogen activator
inhibitors (PAIs ) in the trophoblast and decidua, which would impede the
invasion of the trophoblast cells.24 Finally, the different forms of hCG
present unique kinetics during gestation. The hyperglycosylated hCG (HhCG) is
strongly synthesized by the cells of the extravillous CTB in early pregnancy,
which promotes the implantation of the embryo (hCG is normally produced by the
STB27 and its concentration rapidly decreases to less than 2% after the first
trimester).28 Deregulation of the production of hCG is associated with
hydatidiform moles, particularly the HhCG rate is increased by 5% in complete
moles and approximately 4% for the partial mole.29 The transition to an
invasive tumor is also associated with a significant increase of HhCG,
reaching 30/35% of the total hCG in invasive moles and up 100% for
choriocarcinomas.29-31 Overall, these different factors involved in regulated
manner, are associated to the change in pO2. The factors act together or in
succession during the end of the first trimester of pregnancy and are
responsible for transition of the proliferation phase to the invasion phase of
the placenta and its well development (Fig. 3).

## Epidemiology

In developed countries, the incidence of CHM is approximately 1-3 per 1000
pregnancies and those of the PHM about 3 per 1000 pregnancies.32 These moles
are sporadic and not recurrent except for rare cases known as singleton cases
(when a single family member has recurrent HM) and familial recurrent HMs
(when at least 2 women have one or several HMs); where the genetic origin has
been shown and correspond to an autosomal recessive disease with mutations in
2 genes, NLRP7 and more rarely, KHDC3L.33,34 The frequency of common moles
varies considerably in developing countries, where cases are 10 times more
likely in some Asian or African countries.35,36 These situations tend to have
decreased with time due to the advances in medical monitoring and better
sources of food.36 After one molar pregnancy, the chance of a second complete
or partial mole is 1-2%. The risk of a third molar pregnancy increases
substantially to 15-20% and is not decreased by changing partners and may be
related to familial or sporadic biparental molar disease.32,37,38 More
generally, it is considered that the risk of an additional mole in the next
pregnancy is approximately 5-10 fold higher than the baseline risk for the
"normal" population.39 However, the spontaneous rejection of mole formation
has also been observed. Conversely, it is impossible to know whether it is
more frequent with PHM. The difficulty, even today, is to obtain a correct
diagnosis between partial and complete moles when these pathological entities
are poorly developed during the first trimester of pregnancy. The term,
partial mole was accepted in 1977 and coincides with the improved technology
of ultrasounds. During the first trimester, the villi are not yet
substantially hydropic and still present vessels. The classification of these
tumors during this period of development presents many uncertainties.40,41
Higher frequencies of molar pregnancies are seen in the upper and lower
extremes of maternal age; younger than 13-18 y or older than 45-50 y.39,42 The
ratio of complete to partial moles changes significantly with age. It is
higher in the upper extremes of maternal age, 63% for those aged 13-18 y and
55% to 93% for those aged 41-50 y respectively.39 However, the study by Savage
and Williams43 provides detailed data regarding the risk of partial and
complete molar pregnancies with increasing maternal age and confirms that the
risk of partial molar pregnancy varies relatively little with age, while
complete molar pregnancies contributing to the main component of the overall
increase with age. This work shows that the PHM likely corresponds to
fertilization anomalies observed in the general population unlike CHM (PHM are
biparental but 2 spermatozoa are fertilizing).43,44

The CHM are more frequently invasive than PHM. This malignant change in molar
pregnancies seems to be associated with the male origin of the DNA.39 The
possibility that heterozygous moles (see above) arising from 2 sperm
fertilising the "empty egg" may have a higher risk of malignant change is
another observation.45 Approximately 80% of the HM is self-limiting i.e.,
prevents itself from becoming invasive. The proportion of HM which change into
invasive moles ranges from 7-17% or in rare cases 2-5% to a choriocarcinoma; a
malignant, rapidly growing and metastatic cancer.4,46 60% of all the
choriocarcinoma are not preceded by a clinically recognized HM.47,48 The CHM
carry approximately a 15% risk of malignant change, while the PHM have a much
lower risk of malignant change; approximatly 0.5-1%.43 The fact that these HM
can be repetitive with different male partners rather suggests an underlying
oocyte problem.38 Therefore, an important question to address would be; what
is the karyotype of these moles?

## Genetic background

Since the 1980s, several theoretical models have been proposed to explain the
occurrence of these moles. In the case of complete moles, the oocyte would
lose its nucleus just after sperm penetration followed by a duplication of the
paternal chromosomes (Fig. 4 (1)), unless 2 sperm are fertilizing (Fig. 4
(2)). The oocytes may present a level of immaturity which could be responsible
for a delay in the division of the female pronucleus when compared to the male
pronucleus. Thus, during the first cell divisions of the zygote, this
dyssynchrony would promote the destruction / rejection of the maternal
chromosomes. It may be observed, in rare cases of CHM, the presence of one
maternal chromosome among the duplicated paternal chromosomes, which provides
an additional argument for advocates of this hypothesis.49 Among the CHM, 80%
to 90% have a diploid genome and are androgenetic. Among them, the majority
are monospermic and 10%-20% are dispermic. The remaining 10% to 20% have a
2-parent genomic contribution to their genome.4,50

Figure 4.

The cytogenetic origin of HM. CHM develops after monospermic (1) or dispermic
(2) fertilization of an ovum whose maternal chromosomes have been lost (or
destroyed) just after conception. The result is an androgenetic diploid zygote
with in case of (1) an endoreplication of the paternal chromosomes. Using the
hypothesis of Golubovsky (3) a normal ovum is fertilized by 2 spermatozoa and
the triploid zygote is at the origin of all the types of HM including the PHM,
which are generally triploid by dispermy. In rare cases (4) -some patients
have recurrent CHM - the zygote has a bi- parental diploid karyotype. Genetic
studies in these patients and their families have found an association with
mutations in 2 genes NLRP7 and more rarely KHDC3L.

In other rarer cases (1% CHM) (Fig. 3 (4)), fertilization takes place between
a healthy sperm and a haploid egg carrying a mutated copy of the gene NLRP7
(47 different mutations have been described) or KHDC3L gene (minor gene),
which are probably involved in maintaining the integrity and organization of
the oocyte cortical region and the orientation of cells in the pre-
implantatory embryo toward the formation of the trophoblast or embryo.51 This
results in biparental diploid CHM that are recurrent in the same woman, which
is not the case for androgenetic moles (the most common moles) that are
generally sporadic and non-recurrent. Once again, we find that with these
recurrent moles, the expression of the mutated genes responsible for the
abnormal differentiation of oocytes, which corroborates our earlier hypothesis
regarding the oocyte immaturity. For partial moles, fertilization takes place
between the oocyte and 2 sperm (or more rarely with a diploid sperm). The
zygote is thus triploid (Fig. 4 (3)).8 In rare cases the PHM have also been
reported with other karyotypes (diploid biparental, triploid dyginic,
tetraploid triandric).52

These explanations were reconsidered in 2003 by Golubovsky53. He points out
that (1) it would need a regular "stock" of anuclear oocytes in order to
ensure the frequency of the CHM, (2) the empty oocytes can be obtained "in
vitro" but question their viability "in vivo" and/or whether they can be
fertilized (3) in the case of twins, of which one is a CHM and the other a
fetus, it has been observed that the prevalence of CHM diploids is
androgenetic 46XX,54 which can be explain by diploidization concept and the
monozygotic origin of such associations (Fig. 4 (3)). With regards to the
first remark, the fast disappearance of the maternal chromosomes in the zygote
is presented and not in the oocytes, which avoids the problem of the stock of
empty oocytes. To explain the appearance of a complete mole, Golubovsky
suggests a haploid oocyte fertilized by 2 spermatozoids. During the first
divisions, the triploid zygote would be at the origin of a cellular clone with
2n chromosomes and of another with 1n paternal chromosomes. The 2n clone will
form a normal fetus and the clone with 1n after endoreplication of the
chromosomes will give rise to a CHM (twin fetus) (to refer to Fig. 4 (3)).
From the epidemiologic point of view, the frequency of these triploidies (1%
of all the conceptuses) logically could include all the types of HM, in
particular the partial moles as they are of triploid origin. It should be
noted that the frequency of the triploidies obtained by digyny increases with
the age of the patient, contrary to the triploidies obtained by diandry that
are more frequent in the younger patients. Thus, the number of PHM of
dispermic origin are reduced with the age of the patient.55 This new
explanatory framework proposes that the oocyte presents an abnormal cortical
reaction which would support the entry of 2 spermatozoids51 (normally, the
release of the cortical granules enzymatic contents prohibits the access to
the oocyte to more than one sperm). These various hypotheses assume that the
differentiation of the oocyte was inadequate, which reinforces the hypothesis
of an immature oocyte. Other observations show that the nutritional
environment of the woman during her pregnancy can also be responsible.

## Epigenetic factors

Numerous risk factors for molar pregnancies have been suggested, including
paternal age,56 maternal genetic anomalies,57 blood group,58 oral
contraceptives,59 maternal age60 and environmental factors; in particular
vitamin A and the folates.61 However, the only clear data is related to
maternal age39 and the previous occurrence of a prior molar pregnancy.37 The
excess risk is rather associated with CHM and less with PHM. Despite this,
findings from various studies in animals show that diet can reset the genetic
imprint,62 which is important for the normal development of the human embryo.
Moreover, a deficit of vitamin A or/and of folates during the period of 18 to
21 d of gestation is associated with an absence of vascularisation of the
placental villosities,63 which is observed in the CHM. It is also noted that a
reduction in vitamin A in the food of the patients at the time of their
pregnancy could explain the geographical distribution of these moles.64

Our recent study65 carried out in Morocco and Senegal, where the annual cycle
of the seasons is defined with one period of severe diet (limited fresh
products), showed a strong correlation between the nutritional deficit of the
mothers at the time of the conception of their daughters and the development
of a CHM during the pregnancy of the daughters as an adult. It is mainly a
deficit in vitamin A and/or B9 (folates) during the first weeks of the
development of the female fetus which could deteriorate the normal
differentiation of their oocytes. Vitamin A plays a significant role in the
progress of meiosis; its insufficiency is responsible for the development of
an immature oocyte66,67 and prevents meiosis II from being carried out
correctly.68 The folates are necessary for the synthesis of proteins and the
DNA. Their effects were observed on the one hand, in the differentiation of
the oocyte and the zygote, in particular to the integrity and organization of
the cortical zone51 and on the other hand over the instability of the
chromosomes of maternal origin.69 At the time of fertilization, the male
pronucleus continues its mitotic division; the chromosomes of the female
pronucleus would be destroyed or rejected quickly. Moreover, vitamin A and
folates intervene in the mechanisms of the DNA methylation during the
reprogramming of the parental imprinting. Contrary to other human genes, these
genes (approximately 1% of the genome) are expressed only in a monoallelic way
according to the paternal or maternal origin of the zygote chromosomes. It is
the existence in the Human species of these imprinted genes that prevent the
parthenogenesis70 and allows the successful development of the human embryo.
Such deficits that occur during oogenesis are responsible for the qualitative
and functional anomalies of the oocyte.61 Such methylation defects affect the
imprinted genes in the oocyte. The maternal methylation disappears and is
replaced with paternal methylation. Undoubtedly this is one of the reasons why
the affected women may have HM with various sexual partners.71

Other studies carried out in Hawaii where the risk of CHM is weak, show that
the women whose migration toward Hawaii was recent; present a high rate of
CHM. In fact, these women were born in the Philippines where this rate of CHM
is high. The Japanese women who settled in Hawaii, but whose migration is much
older, do not present any additional risk (Japan at the time was a high-risk
country).72 Moreover, in Japan between the years 1974 and the 2000, the
incidence of the HM significantly decreased by 2.79/1000 alive births in 1976
to 1.61/1000 in 1997. However, this regression is associated only with the
fall of the CHM which decreased from 1.71/1000 alive births in 1985 to
0.49/1000 in 2000 and not to the PHM. Nonetheless, the first were shown to be
androgenetic while the latter were shown to be triploid diandric. After the
deprivations of the war (1937-1945), the economic conditions gradually
improved and the gametogenesis among women gradually normalized, explaining
the reduction of the CHM.73 The PHM which are mainly the result of the
anomalies of the process gametogenesis/fertilization in the human species are
not influenced by such variations in the nutritional environment.

In conclusion, the data suggests that it is the mother of the patient with the
mole occurrence who is responsible for this pathology and not the patient
themselves. This can be attributed to the transgenerational effect.65 Finally
what is known about the history of the HM remains partly an enigma.
