Lesson Transcript

Instructor: _John Williams_

Reproduction is necessary for the perpetuation of a species, including humans.
This video lesson explains conception and ovulation as well as their roles in
reproduction. Symptoms of conception will also be briefly discussed.

## Understanding Conception

We have all experienced it, even though we have no recollection of it ever
happening. We can all credit it with our existence, but we cannot truly
remember what happened during the process of it. That 'it' is conception.
Let's discuss the process of conception and why it is so important for human
existence.

Biologically, **conception** is the moment when a sperm cell from a male
breaches the **ovum** , or egg, from a female. The process is also known as
**fertilization** and is the initial stage of development for human growth.
This is a key stage of sexual reproduction, which is a form of reproduction
that is necessary for genetic diversity. This is the reproduction method
employed by humans.

In order for sexual reproduction to be successful, something called meiosis
must take place. The process of **meiosis** , or sex cell division, is
necessary for the production of **gametes** , or sex cells.

Most cells in the body have 46 chromosomes, which is a full complement of DNA.
However, the goal of meiosis is to reduce this number of gametes by half, down
to 23 chromosomes. During fertilization, the sperm cell and the ovum, which
are the gametes, will have 23 chromosomes apiece. When they combine, the total
chromosomal number of the new structure is 46; this is now called a **zygote**
, or a fertilized egg cell.

## Ovulation

The process of conception is one that requires a fair amount of probability
and luck. Several factors must be in place in order for fertilization to
occur. For one, the sperm cells have to survive the release from the male
system. This process alone contributes heavily to the likelihood of
conception.

Secondly, the female body has to be hospitable to the sperm cells in order for
them to survive. This hospitable nature of the female reproductive system
changes throughout the 28-day menstrual cycle. But perhaps the most important
factor for conception is the process of ovulation.

**Ovulation** takes place in the **ovaries** , or female gonads, and is the
process by which the ovaries release ova for fertilization. This usually takes
place around day 14 of the menstrual cycle and is controlled by luteinizing
hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone.

An ovulated egg is viable within the system for roughly 2-3 days before it
disintegrates. Therefore, conception is most likely to happen if sex is
performed prior to ovulation, and timing plays a large role in successful
conception.

## Symptoms of Conception

Once a zygote is formed, it produces hormonal signals to prevent additional
ovulation and menses, which is the process of uterine tissue breakdown.
Therefore, one of the most common signs of conception is a missed menstrual
period after sexual activity. While this is not 100% accurate and other
factors can cause a missed period, this is usually an indication that
fertilization may have taken place.

Additionally, after **implantation** , or attachment of the developing egg to
the uterus, many women experience bleeding or spotting. Finally, the uterine
lining will continue to grow thicker in order to support the developing child,
and mucus develops within the cervix. These key processes are designed to
protect the embryo that develops from conception.

## Lesson Summary

Let's review.

From a biological standpoint, the moment an egg, or **ovum** , is fertilized
by a sperm cell is known as **conception**. Conception is also referred to as
**fertilization** and is the initial stage of development for human growth.

The process of **meiosis** , or sex cell division, is necessary for the
production of **gametes** , or sex cells. The sperm cell and the ovum, during
fertilization, will have 23 chromosomes apiece. When they combine, the total
chromosomal number of the new structure is 46; this is now called a **zygote**
, or fertilized egg cell.

**Ovulation** takes place in the **ovaries** , or female gonads, and is the
process by which the ovaries release ova for fertilization. It is controlled
by luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone.

Symptoms of conception can include a missed period and bleeding or spotting
after **implantation** , which is the attachment of the developing egg to the
uterus.

        * Conception occurs when an ovum is fertilized by a sperm cell. 
    * Conception is the first stage of development for a zygote. 
    * Conception can only take place after ovulation which is the release of the ova from the ovaries for fertilization. 
    * Symptoms of conception may include a missed period, spotting, or bleeding after implantation occurs.

conception and enable you to:

    
        * Recognize the role of meiosis in reproduction 
    * Describe how conception occurs 
    * List some symptoms of conception
