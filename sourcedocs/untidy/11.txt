The actual embryo or fetal age (also known as conceptual age) is the time
elapsed from fertilization of the egg near the time of ovulation . However,
because most women do not know when ovulation occurred, but do know when their
last period began, the time elapsed since the first day of the last normal
menstrual period , the menstrual age, is used to determine the age of a
pregnancy. The menstrual age is also known as the gestational age. Gestational
age is conventionally expressed as completed weeks. Therefore, a 36 week, 6
day fetus is considered to be a 36 week fetus. [25]

First Trimester of Pregnancy [4]  
** ( Less than14 weeks 0 days)

**Weeks 1 and 2 of Pregnancy**  
![](http://perinatology.com/images/ovulationsm.jpg) | During the first two
weeks after the last menstrual period egg follicles mature in the ovaries
under the stimulus of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) a hormone secreted by
the pituitary gland in the brain. High levels of the hormone estradiol,
produced by the developing egg follicle, cause secretion of luteinizing
hormone (LH) ,yet another hormone from the pituitary gland. LH causes release
of the egg from its follicle (ovulation)

For women with 28-day cycles, ovulation usually occurs on days 13 to 15.

**Gestational Age 3 weeks . Embryonic Age 1 week .**

![](http://perinatology.com/images/Fertilizationsm.jpg)

|

  * During the third week, if fertilization occurs , the fertilized egg (called a zygote) will begin producing the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (the pregnancy hormone) 
  * Human chorionic gonadotropin first becomes detectable in the mother's blood and urine between 6 and 14 days after fertilization (3 to 4 weeks gestational age).
  * During the 3rd week the sex of the fetus is determined by the father's sperm, and twins may be formed.
  * Fatigue and swollen or tender breasts are sometimes the first signs of pregnancy.

**Gestational Age 4 weeks ( 0.9 months) .** **Embryonic Age 2 weeks**

> ![](http://perinatology.com/images/pin.jpg)

  * Week 5 is the beginning of the embryonic period which lasts from the the 5th to the 10th week. 
  * It is during this critical period that many birth defects occur in the developing embryo. 
  * Most of these birth defects will have no known cause or be due to a combination of factors (multifactorial). 

**Gestational Age 6** **weeks** **(1.4 months) .** **Embryonic Age 4 weeks**

weeks**

![](http://perinatology.com/images/7wsm.jpg) |

  * The embryo is now about 0. 4 inches (1 cm ) long. 
  * This week the hands and feet are forming as well as the mouth and face. 
  * The heart is beating at about 120 beats per minute. Movement of the embryo can be detected by ultrasound. 
  * By week 7 the trachea and bronchi of the lungs have formed , and the **pseudoglandular stage of lung development** begins [17]
  * Crownrump length of 7 mm or greater and no heartbeat, or   
mean sac diameter of 25 mm or greater and no embryo is considered consistent
with early **pregnancy loss** [20]
