Greenhouse gases began warming the world's oceans in the early 1800s, decades
earlier than previously thought, according to a new study.

Scientists generally regard the later part of the 19th century as the point at
which human activity started influencing the climate. But the new study brings
that date forward to the 1830s.

The study, published today in the journal Nature, draws on a new record of
tropical sea surface temperature dating back to 1500, captured in fossilised
corals and tiny marine organisms.

The findings suggest the climate system responds to greenhouse gases quicker
than thought, say the authors, with consequences for understanding future
climate change.

#### 'Industrial era'

When human society began to industrialise, we started to change the chemistry
of the atmosphere by adding CO2 to the air, the authors of today's paper
begin.

But knowing _how much_ warming we 've seen means comparing temperatures now to
a time before the world started to feel the effects of industrialising.
Scientists refer to that baseline period as "pre-industrial" and the period
since then as the "industrial era".

But defining these terms is fraught with difficulty, the paper explains:

"Determining an unambiguous time for the start of the industrial era is
difficult, and forms part of the debate over a formal definition of the
Anthropocene."

#### Natural recorders

What we think of as the modern temperature record is made up of many thousands
of measurements from the air above land and the ocean surface, collected by
ships, buoys and sometimes satellites, too.

To shed light on the difficult question of when human-caused warming began,
the authors of the new study make use of a different type of temperature
record.

Corals and tiny fossilised marine organisms buried in the seabed act as
natural recorders of past ocean temperatures. Along with tree rings and ice
cores, which offer a window into land temperatures throughout Earth's history,
these are all examples of "climate proxies".

Adding in the information from the proxies extends the instrumental
temperature record in today's study back in time to 1500AD. It is different
from previous studies that use climate proxies because it uses a brand new
temperature reconstruction for the tropical oceans.

Oceans are important for understanding global climate because more than 90% of
the heat reaching Earth's surface ends up there. Changes in how much heat the
oceans take up is one reason why we see periods of faster and slower
temperature change throughout Earth's history.

#### ‘Time of emergence’

Even supposing scientists had a perfect data record going back far enough,
pinpointing a start date on the industrial era would still be tricky. This is
because detecting a climate change "signal" in the temperature record isn't
necessarily the same as when the warming actually began.

The point at which a trend becomes clear within the average temperature data
for a given region - known as the "time of emergence" - depends on when the
source of the warming begins, how fast it happens and the amount of background
"noise" obscuring the signal.

Natural fluctuations in the climate from one year to the next, for example,
can mean a trend might only be detectable several decades after whatever is
driving it begins to have an effect.

The instrumental temperature record shows the signal of rising temperatures
emerged in the tropical ocean in about the 1950s. Today's study uses the extra
information captured in the proxy record to trace the start of the warming
back a full 120 years, to the 1830s.

Prof Nerilie Abram, a researcher of Earth's past climates at the Australian
National University and the study's lead author says:

"Somebody living in the 1830s or even the 1890s would not have been able to
distinguish that there was this change afoot,” she says. “It’s by having this
long record now that extends almost 200 years from that point that we can go
back and say ‘Well, this was when the changes first started.’”

Warming in the Arctic also began in the early 1830s, the paper says, although
the signal doesn't emerge clearly in the temperature record for 100 years
because of the "noise" coming from natural variability. The Arctic is where
scientists are seeing the fastest temperature rise, known as Arctic
Amplification.

The Southern Hemisphere showed a more sluggish response, with warming starting
in the late 1890s and a clear signal not emerging until the 1960s. While parts
of Antarctica have warmed - notably the Antarctic Peninsula and West
Antarctica - there is no clear fingerprint of warming across the continent as
a whole, the paper notes.

The important point the study makes is that the onset of warming in the
tropical ocean in the 1830s is earlier than is typically assumed from the
instrumental record and from other proxy reconstructions that have focused
mainly on Northern Hemisphere land temperatures.

Dr Ed Hawkins, a researcher at the University of Reading who was not involved
in the study, says it shows a period of "sustained warming" began in the early
19th century and continues until today. He tells Carbon Brief:

"This signal of warming emerged above the noise of background variability
during the 20th century for most parts of the globe. This is further evidence
that the climate has already changed significantly since the pre-industrial
period."

Hawkins has also published work on "time of emergence". But instead of looking
back through history, he looks ahead to when temperature and rainfall in
different parts of the world are likely to emerge from current natural
variability.

#### **Cause and effect**

Keen not to jump to conclusions about the source of the warming in the early
1830s, Abram and her colleagues used climate models to examine what kinds of
external factors could be responsible.

Up until the early 19th Century, a series volcanic eruptions were causing the
Earth to cool. Some warming followed as the climate readjusted itself, but it
isn't enough to explain what happened after, explains co-author Dr Nicholas
McKay from Arizona University.

"If you run the models with only volcanoes and no increases in greenhouse
gases, you see a warming, starting in the early 1800s. But then it levels off,
and you don’t see that warming continue through the 20th Century.”

Only by including greenhouse gases in the model do the scientists see a
pattern of warming that matches what the proxy records suggest the world
actually experienced, McKay says.

#### **Oversensitive**

Knowing how quickly the Earth responded to greenhouse gases at the start of
the industrial era tells scientists a lot about the sensitivity of the climate
system.

Pinning a number on how much global temperature rises in response to a
doubling of carbon dioxide - known as the climate sensitivity - is a big
question in climate science as it helps more accurately predict how much
warming we'll see in future.

But while today's study suggests the world's oceans are more sensitive than
previously thought, there is an element of good news to take from that, say
the authors. If we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there might just be
some regions where we could see quick paybacks, proffers Abram.
