Average global temperatures from 2014 to 2018 compared to a baseline average
from 1951 to 1980, according to NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.

**Global warming** is a long-term rise in the average temperature of the
Earth's climate system, an aspect of climate change shown by temperature
measurements and by multiple effects of the warming.[2][3] Though earlier
geological periods also experienced episodes of warming,[4] the term commonly
refers to the observed and continuing increase in average air and ocean
temperatures since 1900 caused mainly by emissions of greenhouse gases in the
modern industrial economy.[5] In the modern context the terms _global warming_
and _climate change_ are commonly used interchangeably,[6] but _climate
change_ includes both _global warming_ and its effects, such as changes to
precipitation and impacts that differ by region.[7][8] Many of the observed
changes in climate since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental
temperature record, and in historical and paleoclimate proxy records of
climate change over thousands to millions of years.[2]

In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment
Report concluded, "It is _extremely likely_ that human influence has been the
dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century."[9] The
largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as
carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Climate model projections
summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century, the global
surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 °C (0.5 to 3.1 °F)
to 2.6 to 4.8 °C (4.7 to 8.6 °F) depending on the rate of greenhouse gas
emissions and on climate feedback effects.[10] These findings have been
recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized
nations[11][a] and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or
international standing.[13][14]

Effects of global warming include rising sea levels, regional changes in
precipitation, more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, and
expansion of deserts.[15] Surface temperature increases are greatest in the
Arctic, with the continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice.
Overall, higher temperatures bring more rain and snowfall, but for some
regions droughts and wildfires increase instead.[16] Climate change impacts
humans by, amongst other things, threatening food security from decreasing
crop yields, and the abandonment of populated areas and damage to
infrastructure due to rising sea levels.[17][18] Environmental impacts include
the extinction or relocation of ecosystems as they adapt to climate change,
with coral reefs,[19] mountain ecosystems, and Arctic ecosystems most
immediately threatened.[20] Because the climate system has a large "inertia"
and greenhouse gases will remain in the atmosphere for a long time, climatic
changes and their effects will continue to become more pronounced for many
centuries even if further increases to greenhouse gases stop.[21]

Globally, a majority of people consider global warming a serious or very
serious issue.[22] Possible societal responses to global warming include
mitigation by emissions reduction, adaptation to its effects, and possible
future climate engineering. Every country in the world is a party to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),[23] whose
ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change.[24]
Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required[25]
and that global warming should be limited to well below 2 °C (3.6 °F) compared
to pre-industrial levels,[b] with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5 °C (2.7
°F).[27] Some scientists call into question climate adaptation feasibility,
with higher emissions scenarios,[28] or the two degree temperature target.[29]

## Observed temperature changes

Main article: Instrumental temperature record

Two millennia of mean surface temperatures according to different
reconstructions from climate proxies, each smoothed on a decadal scale, with
the instrumental temperature record overlaid in black.

Multiple independently produced datasets confirm that between 1880 and 2012,
the global average (land and ocean) surface temperature increased by 0.85
[0.65 to 1.06] °C.[30] Currently, surface temperature rise with about 0.2 °C
degrees per decade.[31] Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights have
decreased, and the number of warm days and night have increased.[32] These
trends can be compared to historical temperature trends: patterns of warming
and cooling like the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age were not
as synchronous as current warming, but did reach temperatures as high as
late-20th century regionally.[33]

Although the increase of the average near-surface atmospheric temperature is
commonly used to track global warming, over 90% of the additional energy
stored in the climate system over the last 50 years is in warmer ocean
water.[34] The rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and the
atmosphere.[35][c]

The warming evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with
a wide range of observations, documented by many independent scientific
groups,[36] for example in most continental regions the frequency and
intensity of heavy precipitation has increased.[37] Further examples include
sea level rise,[38] widespread melting of snow and land ice,[39] increased
heat content of the oceans,[36] increased humidity,[36] and the earlier timing
of spring events,[40] such as the flowering of plants.[41]

### Regional trends

See also: Regional effects of global warming and Polar amplification

Global warming refers to global averages, with the amount of warming varying
by region. Since 1979, global average land temperatures have increased about
twice as fast as global average ocean temperatures.[42][ _needs update?_ ]
This is due to the larger heat capacity of the oceans and because oceans lose
more heat by evaporation.[43] Where greenhouse gas emissions occur does not
impact the location of warming because the major greenhouse gases persist long
enough to diffuse across the planet, although localized black carbon deposits
on snow and ice do contribute to Arctic warming.[44]

The Northern Hemisphere and North Pole have heated much faster than the South
Pole and Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more
land, its arrangement around the Arctic Ocean has resulted in the maximum
surface area flipping from reflective snow and ice cover to ocean and land
surfaces that absorb more sunlight.[45] Arctic temperatures have increased and
are predicted to continue to increase during this century at over twice the
rate of the rest of the world.[46][ _needs update?_ ] As the temperature
difference between the Arctic and the equator decreases ocean currents that
are driven by that temperature difference, like the Gulf Stream, are
weakening.[47]

### Short-term slowdowns and surges

Because the climate system has large thermal inertia, it can take centuries
for the climate to fully adjust. While record-breaking years attract
considerable public interest, individual years are less significant than the
overall trend. Global surface temperature is subject to short-term
fluctuations that overlay long-term trends, and can temporarily mask or
magnify them.[48]

An example of such an episode is the slower rate of surface temperature
increase from 1998 to 2012, which was dubbed the global warming hiatus by the
media and some scientists.[49] Throughout this period ocean heat storage
continued to progress steadily upwards, and in subsequent years surface
temperatures have spiked upwards. The slower pace of warming can be attributed
to heating and cooling in the Pacific Ocean from natural variability such as
El Niño and La Nina events, reduced solar activity, and a number of volcanic
eruptions that inserted sunlight-reflecting particles into the atmosphere.[50]

## Physical drivers of climate change

![Refer to

forcings.svg/330px-Radiative-forcings.svg.png)

Contribution of natural factors and human activities to radiative forcing of
climate change.[51] Radiative forcing values are for the year 2005, relative
to the pre-industrial era (1750).[51] The contribution of solar irradiance to
radiative forcing is 5% of the value of the combined radiative forcing due to
increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and
nitrous oxide.[52]

Further information: Attribution of recent climate change

By itself, the climate system may generate changes in global temperatures for
years (such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation) to decades[53] or
centuries[54] at a time. Other changes emanate from so-called _external
forcings_. These forcings are "external" to the climate system, but not
necessarily external to Earth.[55] Examples of external forcings include
changes in the composition of the atmosphere (e.g., increased concentrations
of greenhouse gases), solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in
Earth's orbit around the Sun.[56]

Attributing detected temperature changes and extreme events to manmade
increases in greenhouse gases requires scientists to rule out known internal
climate variabilities and natural external forcings. So a key approach is to
use physical models of the climate system to determine unique fingerprints for
all potential external forcings. By comparing these fingerprints with the
observed pattern and evolution of the climate change, and the observed
evolution of the forcings, the causes of the observed changes can be
determined.[57]

Main articles: Greenhouse gas, Greenhouse effect, and Carbon dioxide in
Earth's atmosphere

Greenhouse gases trap heat radiating from Earth to space.[58] This heat, in
the form of infrared radiation, gets absorbed and emitted by these gases in
the planet's atmosphere thus warming the lower atmosphere and the surface. On
Earth, an atmosphere containing naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse
gases causes air temperature near the surface to be warmer by about 33 °C (59
°F) than it would be in their absence.[59][d] Without the Earth's atmosphere,
the Earth's average temperature would be well below the freezing temperature
of water.[60] The major greenhouse gases are water vapour, which causes about
36–70% of the greenhouse effect; carbon dioxide (CO2), which causes 9–26%;
methane (CH4), which causes 4–9%; and ozone (O3), which causes
3–7%.[61][62][63]

Human activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased the amount of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative forcing
from CO2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs, and nitrous oxide. In 2011, the
concentrations of CO2 and methane had increased by about 40% and 150%
respectively since pre-industrial times,[64] with CO2 readings taken at the
world's primary benchmark site in Mauna Loa surpassing 400 ppm in 2013 for the
first time.[65] These levels are much higher than at any time during the last
800,000 years, the period for which reliable data has been extracted from ice
cores.[66][67] Less direct geological evidence indicates that CO2 values
haven't been this high for millions of years.[65]

Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 were 49 billion tonnes
of carbon dioxide-equivalents per year (using the most recent global warming
potentials over 100 years from the AR5 report). Of these emissions, 65% was
carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning and industry, 11% was carbon dioxide
from land use change, which is primarily due to deforestation, 16% was
methane, 6.2% was nitrous oxide, and 2.0% were fluorinated gases.[68] Using
life-cycle assessment to estimate emissions relating to final consumption, the
dominant sources of 2010 emissions were: food (26–30% of emissions);[69]
washing, heating and lighting (26%); personal transport and freight (20%); and
building construction (15%).[70]

### Aerosols and soot

![Refer to

ShipTracks_MODIS_2005may11.jpg)

Ship tracks can be seen as lines in these clouds over the Atlantic Ocean on
the East Coast of the United States, an example of the Twomey effect.

Solid and liquid particles known as _aerosols_ – from volcanoes, plankton and
human-made pollutants – reflect incoming sunlight,[71] cooling the
climate.[72] From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight
reaching the Earth's surface was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as
global dimming,[73] typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil
fuel burning.[74][75] Aerosol removal by precipitation gives tropospheric
aerosols an atmospheric lifetime of only about a week, while stratospheric
aerosols can remain in the atmosphere for a few years.[76] Global aerosols
have been declining since 1990, removing some of the masking of global warming
that aerosols had been providing.[77][78][75]

In addition to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing solar
radiation, aerosols have indirect effects on the Earth's radiation budget.
Sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and thus lead to clouds that
have more and smaller cloud droplets. These clouds reflect solar radiation
more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets, a phenomenon
known as the _Twomey effect_.[79] This effect also causes droplets to be of
more uniform size, which reduces growth of raindrops and makes the cloud more
reflective to incoming sunlight, known as the _Albrecht effect_.[80] Indirect
effects are most noticeable in marine stratiform clouds, and have very little
radiative effect on convective clouds. Indirect effects of aerosols are the
largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.[81] [ _needs update_ ]

While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, if black
carbon in soot falls on snow or ice, it can also increase global warming. Not
only does it increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting
and sea level rise.[82][83] Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic
could reduce global warming by 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2050.[84] When soot is
suspended in the atmosphere, it directly absorbs solar radiation, heating the
atmosphere and cooling the surface. In areas with high soot production, such
as rural India, as much as 50% of surface warming due to greenhouse gases may
be masked by atmospheric brown clouds.[85][86] The influences of atmospheric
particles, including black carbon, are most pronounced in the tropics and
northern mid-latitudes, with the effects of greenhouse gases dominant in the
other parts of the world.[87][88]

### Incoming sunlight

Further information: Solar activity and climate

As the Sun is Earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight
directly affect the climate system.[89] Solar irradiance has been measured
directly by satellites since 1978,[90] but indirect measurements are available
beginning in the early 1600s.[89] There has been no upward trend in the amount
of the Sun's energy reaching the Earth, so it cannot be responsible for the
current warming.[91] Physical climate models are also unable to reproduce the
rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into account only
variations in solar output and volcanic activity.[92][93]

Another line of evidence for the warming not being due to the Sun is the
temperature changes at different levels in the Earth's atmosphere.[94]
According to basic physical principles, the greenhouse effect produces warming
of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), but cooling of the upper atmosphere
(the stratosphere).[95][96] If solar variations were responsible for the
observed warming, warming of both the troposphere and the stratosphere would
be expected, but that has not been the case.[97]

While variations in solar activity have not produced recent global warming,
variations in solar output over geologic time (millions to billions of years
ago) are believed to have caused major changes in the earth's climate.[98][
_not in citation given_ ] The 11-year solar cycle of sunspot activity also
introduces climate changes that have a small cyclical effect on annual global
temperatures.[99] The tilt of the Earth's axis and the shape of its orbit
around the Sun vary slowly over tens of thousands of years in a phenomenon
known as the _Milankovitch cycles_. This changes climate by changing the
seasonal and latitudinal distribution of incoming solar energy at the Earth's
surface,[100] resulting in periodic glacial and interglacial periods over the
last few million years.[101] During the last few thousand years, this
phenomenon contributed to a slow cooling trend at high latitudes of the
Northern Hemisphere during summer, a trend that was reversed by greenhouse-
gas-induced warming during the 20th century.[102][103][104] Orbital cycles
favourable for glaciation are not expected within the next 50,000
years.[105][106]

## Climate change feedback

Main articles: Climate change feedback and Climate sensitivity

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/NORTH_POLE_Ice_%2819626661335%29.jpg/220px-

NORTH_POLE_Ice_%2819626661335%29.jpg)

The dark ocean surface reflects only 6 percent of incoming solar radiation,
whereas sea ice reflects 50 to 70 percent.[107]

The response of the climate system to an initial forcing is increased by
positive _feedbacks_ and reduced by negative feedbacks.[108] The main negative
feedback to global temperature change is radiative cooling to space as
infrared radiation, which increases strongly with increasing temperature.[109]
The main positive feedbacks are the water vapour feedback, the ice–albedo
feedback, and probably the net effect of clouds.[110] Uncertainty over
feedbacks is the major reason why different climate models project different
magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions.[111]

As air gets warmer, it can hold more moisture. After an initial warming due to
emissions of greenhouse gases, the atmosphere will hold more water. As water
is a potent greenhouse gas, this further heats the climate: the _water vapour
feedback_.[110] The reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the Arctic reduces
the albedo (reflectivity) of the Earth's surface.[112] More of the sun's
energy is now absorbed in these regions, contributing to Arctic amplification,
which has caused Arctic temperatures to increase at almost twice the rate of
the rest of the world.[46] Arctic amplification also causes methane to be
released as permafrost melts, which is expected to surpass land use changes as
the second strongest anthropogenic source of greenhouse gases by the end of
the century.[113]

Cloud cover may change in the future. To date, cloud changes have had a
cooling effect, with NASA estimating that aerosols produced by the burning of
hydrocarbons have limited warming by half from 1850 to 2010.[71] An analysis
of satellite data between 1983 and 2009 reveals that cloud tops are reaching
higher into the atmosphere and that cloudy storm tracks are shifting toward
Earth's poles, suggesting clouds will be a positive feedback in the
future.[114] A 2019 study indicates that if greenhouse gases reach three times
the current level of atmospheric carbon dioxide that stratocumulus clouds
could abruptly disperse, contributing up to 8 degrees Celsius of warming.[115]

Carbon dioxide stimulates plant growth so the carbon cycle has been a negative
feedback so far: roughly half of each year's CO2 emissions have been absorbed
by plants on land and in oceans,[116] with an estimated 30% increase in plant
growth from 2000 to 2017.[117] The limits and reversal point for this feedback
are an area of uncertainty.[118] As more CO2 and heat are absorbed by the
ocean it is acidifying and ocean circulation can change, changing the rate at
which the ocean can absorb atmospheric carbon.[119] On land, greater plant
growth will be constrained by nitrogen levels and can be reversed by plant
heat stress, desertification, and the release of carbon from soil as the
ground warms.[120]

A concern is that positive feedbacks will lead to a tipping point, where
global temperatures transition to a hothouse climate state even if greenhouse
gas emissions are reduced or eliminated. A 2018 study tried to identify such a
planetary threshold for self-reinforcing feedbacks and found that even a 2 °C
(3.6 °F) increase in temperature over pre-industrial levels, may be enough to
trigger such a hothouse Earth scenario.[121][122][123]

century to the middle 21st century, based on a medium emissions scenario (SRES

Main article: Global climate model

A climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical and biological
processes that affect the climate system.[126] Computer models are run on
supercomputers to reproduce and predict the circulation of the oceans, the
annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface
and the atmosphere.[127] There are more than two dozen scientific institutions
that develop climate models.[127] Model forecasts vary due to different
greenhouse gas inputs and different assumptions about the impact of different
feedbacks on climate sensitivity.

A subset of climate models add societal factors to a simple physical climate
model. These models simulate how population, economic growth and energy use
affect – and interact with – the physical climate. With this information,
scientists can produce scenarios of how greenhouse gas emissions may vary in
the future. Scientists can then run these scenarios through physical climate
models to generate climate change projection.[127]

Climate models include different external forcings for their models. For
different greenhouse gas inputs four RCPs (Representative Concentration
Pathways) are used: "a stringent mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), two
intermediate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0) and one scenario with very high GHG
emissions (RCP8.5).[128] Models also include changes in the Earth's orbit,
historical changes in the sun's activity and volcanic forcing.[127] RCPs only
look at concentrations of greenhouse gases, factoring out uncertainty as to
whether the carbon cycle will continue to remove about half of the carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere each year.[129]

The physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to
simulate contemporary or past climates.[130] Past models have underestimated
the rate of Arctic shrinkage[131] and underestimated the rate of precipitation
increase.[132] Sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models,
but now agrees well with observations.[133][134] The 2017 United States-
published National Climate Assessment notes that "climate models may still be
underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes".[135]

### Physical environmental

Main article: Physical impacts of climate change

The environmental effects of global warming are broad and far-reaching. They
include the following diverse effects:

                    
                                                * Arctic sea ice decline, sea level rise, retreat of glaciers: global warming has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice, making it vulnerable to atmospheric anomalies.[137] Projections of declines in Arctic sea ice vary.[138][139] Recent projections suggest that Arctic summers could be ice-free (defined as an ice extent of less than 1 million square km) as early as 2025–2030.[140] Since 1993, sea level has on average risen with 3.1 ± 0.3 mm per year. Additionally, sea level rise has accelerated from 1993 to 2017.[141] Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects (for a high emissions scenario) that global mean sea level could rise by 52–98 cm.[142] The rate of ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets in the Antarctic is a key area of uncertainty since Antarctica contains 90% of potential sea level rise.[143] Polar amplification and increased ocean warmth are undermining and threatening to unplug Antarctic glacier outlets, potentially resulting in more rapid sea level rise.[144]
                            * Extreme weather, extreme events, tropical cyclones: Data analysis of extreme events from 1960 until 2010 suggests that droughts and heat waves appear simultaneously with increased frequency.[145] Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased since 1980.[146] Projections suggest a probable increase in the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events, such as heat waves.[147] Studies have also linked the rapidly warming Arctic to extreme weather in mid-latitudes as the jet stream becomes more erratic.[148] Maximum rainfall and wind speed from hurricanes and typhoons are likely increasing.[149]
                            * Changes in ocean properties: increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations have led to an increase in dissolved CO2 and as a consequence ocean acidity.[150] Furthermore, oxygen levels decrease because oxygen is less soluble in warmer water, an effect known as _ocean deoxygenation_.[151]
                            * Long-term effects of global warming: On the timescale of centuries to millennia, the magnitude of global warming will be determined primarily by anthropogenic CO 2 emissions.[152] This is due to carbon dioxide's very long lifetime in the atmosphere.[152] Long-term effects also include a response from the Earth's crust, due to ice melting and deglaciation, in a process called _post-glacial rebound_ , when land masses are no longer depressed by the weight of ice. This could lead to landslides and increased seismic and volcanic activities. Tsunamis could be generated by submarine landslides caused by warmer ocean water thawing ocean-floor permafrost or releasing gas hydrates.[153] Sea level rise will continue over many centuries.[154]
                            * Abrupt climate change, tipping points in the climate system: Climate change could result in global, large-scale changes.[155] Some large-scale changes could occur abruptly, i.e. over a short time period, and might also be irreversible. Examples of abrupt climate change are the rapid release of methane and carbon dioxide from permafrost, which would lead to amplified global warming. Another example is the possibility for the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation to slow or to shut down (see also shutdown of thermohaline circulation).[156][157] This could trigger cooling in the North Atlantic, Europe, and North America.[158][159]
                    

### Biosphere

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Endangered_arctic_-

_starving_polar_bear.jpg/250px-Endangered_arctic_-_starving_polar_bear.jpg)

As the climate change melts sea ice, the U.S. Geological Survey projects that
two-thirds of polar bears will disappear by 2050.[160][161]

Main article: Climate change and ecosystems

Ecosystem changes: In terrestrial ecosystems, the earlier timing of spring
events, as well as poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges, have
been linked with high confidence to recent warming.[162] It is expected that
most ecosystems will be affected by higher atmospheric CO2 levels, combined
with higher global temperatures.[163] Expansion of deserts in the subtropics
is probably linked to global warming.[164] Ocean acidification threatens
damage to coral reefs, fisheries, protected species, and other natural
resources of value to society.[150][165] Without substantial actions to reduce
the rate of global warming, land-based ecosystems are at risk of major
ecological shifts, transforming composition and structure.[166]

Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of
many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems.[167] Rising temperatures
have been found to push bees to their physiological limits, and could cause
the extinction of bee populations.[168] Continued ocean uptake of CO2 may
affect the brains and central nervous system of certain fish species, and that
this impacts their ability to hear, smell, and evade predators.[169]

### Impacts on humans

security, Economics of global warming, and Climate change and agriculture

A helicopter drops water on a wildfire in California. Drought and higher
temperatures linked to climate change are driving a trend towards larger
fires.[170][171]

The effects of climate change on human systems, mostly due to warming or
shifts in precipitation patterns, or both, have been detected worldwide. The
future social impacts of climate change will be uneven across the world.[172]
All regions are at risk of experiencing negative impacts,[173] with low-
latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk.[174] Global warming
has likely already increased global economic inequality, and is projected to
do so in the future.[175][176][177]

Regional impacts of climate change are now observable on all continents and
across ocean regions.[178] The Arctic, Africa, small islands and Asian
megadeltas are regions that are likely to be especially affected by future
climate change.[179] Many risks are expected to increase with higher
magnitudes of global warming.[180]

#### Food and water

Crop production will probably be negatively affected in low latitude
countries, while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or
negative.[181] Global warming of around 4 °C relative to late 20th century
levels could pose a large risk to global and regional food security.[182] The
impact of climate change on crop productivity for the four major crops was
negative for wheat and maize, and neutral for soy and rice, in the years
1960–2013.[183] Climate variability and change is projected to severely
compromise agricultural production, including access to food, across
Africa.[184]

By 2050, between 350 million and 600 million people are projected to
experience increased water stress due to climate change in Africa.[184] Water
availability will also become more limited in regions dependent on glacier
water, regions with reductions in rainfall and small islands.[184]

#### Health and security

Aerial view over southern Bangladesh after the passage of cyclone Cyclone
Sidr. A combination of sea level rise and increased rainfall from cyclones
makes countries more vulnerable to floods, impacting people's livelihoods and
health[185]

Generally impacts on public health will be more negative than positive.[186]
Impacts include the direct effects of extreme weather, leading to injury and
loss of life;[187] and indirect effects, such as undernutrition brought on by
crop failures.[188][189] There has been a shift from cold- to heat-related
mortality in some regions as a result of warming.[178] Temperature rise has
been connected to increased numbers of suicides.[190]

Climate change has been linked to an increase in violent conflict by
amplifying poverty and economic shocks, which are well-documented drivers of
these conflicts.[191] Links have been made between a wide range of violent
behaviours including fist fights, violent crimes, civil unrest, or
wars.[192][193][194][195] The violent herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria,
Sudan and other countries in the Sahel region have been exacerbated by climate
change.[196] [197]

#### Livelihoods, industry and infrastructure

In small islands and mega deltas, inundation as a result of sea level rise is
expected to threaten vital infrastructure and human settlements.[198][199]
This could lead to issues of homelessness in countries with low-lying areas
such as Bangladesh, as well as statelessness for populations in island
nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu.[200] Climate change can be an
important driver of migration, both within and between countries.[201][202]

Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate variability and
change because of multiple existing stresses and low adaptive capacity.[184]
Existing stresses include poverty, political conflicts, and ecosystem
degradation. Regions may even become uninhabitable, with humidity and
temperature reaching levels too high for humans to survive.[203]

## Responses

Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are two complementary responses
to global warming. Successful adaptation is easier in the case of substantial
emission reduction.[204] Many of the countries that contributed least to
global greenhouse gas emissions are most vulnerable to climate change, which
raises questions about justice and fairness with regard to mitigation and
adaptation.[204]

### Mitigation

target, labelled "global technology", "decentralized solutions", and
"consumption change". Each pathway shows how various measures (e.g., improved
energy efficiency, increased use of renewable energy) could contribute to
emissions reductions. Image credit: PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment

Annual_greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_sector%2C_in_2010_%28color%29_png.png)

Annual greenhouse gas emissions attributed to different sectors as of the year
2010. Emissions are given as a percentage share of total emissions, measured
in carbon dioxide-equivalents, using global warming potentials from the IPCC
fifth Assessment Report.

Mitigation of climate change is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, or
the enhancement of the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb greenhouse gases
from the atmosphere.[206] There is a large potential for future reductions in
emissions by a combination of activities, including energy conservation and
increased energy efficiency; the use of low-carbon energy technologies, such
as renewable energy, nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage;[207][208]
decarbonizing buildings and transport; and enhancing carbon sinks through, for
example, reforestation and preventing deforestation.[207][208] A 2015 report
by Citibank concluded that transitioning to a low carbon economy would yield
positive return on investments.[209]

#### Drivers of greenhouse gas emissions

Over the last three decades of the twentieth century, gross domestic product
per capita and population growth were the main drivers of increases in
greenhouse gas emissions.[210] CO2 emissions are continuing to rise due to the
burning of fossil fuels and land-use change.[211][212] Emissions can be
attributed to different regions. Attribution of emissions due to land-use
change are subject to considerable uncertainty.[213][214]

Emissions scenarios, estimates of changes in future emission levels of
greenhouse gases, have been projected that depend upon uncertain economic,
sociological, technological, and natural developments.[215] In most scenarios,
emissions continue to rise over the century, while in a few, emissions are
reduced.[216][217] Fossil fuel reserves are abundant, and will not limit
carbon emissions in the 21st century.[218] Emission scenarios, combined with
modelling of the carbon cycle, have been used to produce estimates of how
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the
future.[219] Using the six IPCC SRES "marker" scenarios, models suggest that
by the year 2100, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 could range between 541
and 970 ppm.[220]

#### Reducing greenhouse gases

Near- and long-term trends in the global energy system are inconsistent with
limiting global warming at below 1.5 or 2 °C, relative to pre-industrial
levels.[221][222] Current pledges made as part of the Paris Agreement would
lead to about 3.0 °C of warming at the end of the 21st century, relative to
pre-industrial levels.[223] In limiting warming at below 2 °C, more stringent
emission reductions in the near-term would allow for less rapid reductions
after 2030,[224] and be cheaper overall.[225] Many integrated models are
unable to meet the 2 °C target if pessimistic assumptions are made about the
availability of mitigation technologies.[226]

Co-benefits of climate change mitigation may help society and individuals more
quickly. For example, cycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions[227] while
reducing the effects of a sedentary lifestyle at the same time[228] The
development and scaling-up of clean technology, such as cement that produces
less CO2.[229] is critical to achieve sufficient emission reductions for the
Paris agreement goals.[230]

The most effective and comprehensive policy to reduce carbon emissions is a
carbon tax[231] or the closely related emissions trading.[232] Mitigation at
an individual level is also possible. The most significant action individuals
could make to mitigate their own carbon footprint is to have fewer children,
followed by living car-free, forgoing air travel, and adopting a plant-based
diet.[233][234] Some argue that allocating emissions to one's ancestors is a
category mistake and that children "embody a profound hope for the future",
and that more emphasis should be placed on overconsumption, lifestyle choices
of the world's wealthy, fossil fuel companies and government
inaction.[235][236] Sill others, such as Mayer Hillman, contend that both
individual action and political action by national governments will not be
enough, and only a global transition to zero GHG emissions throughout the
entire economy and a reduction in human population growth will be sufficient
enough to mitigate global warming.[237]

### Adaptation

Main article: Climate change adaptation

Climate change adaptation is the process of adjusting to actual or expected
climate change and its effects.[238] Humans can strive to moderate or avoid
harm due to climate change and exploit opportunities.[238] Examples of
adaptation are improved coast-line protection, better disaster management and
the development of crops that are more resistant.[239] The adaptation may be
planned, either in reaction to or anticipation of global warming, or
spontaneous, i.e., without government intervention.[240]

The public section, private sector and communities are all gaining experience
with adaptation and adaptation is becoming embedded within certain planning
processes.[241] While some adaptation responses call for trade-offs, others
bring synergies and co-benefits.[241] Environmental organizations and public
figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail,
while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions
reductions.[242]

Adaptation is especially important in developing countries since those
countries are predicted to bear the brunt of the effects of global
warming.[243] That is, the capacity and potential for humans to adapt, called
_adaptive capacity_ , is unevenly distributed across different regions and
populations, and developing countries generally have less capacity to
adapt.[244]

### Climate engineering

Main article: Climate engineering

Climate engineering (sometimes called _geoengineering_ or _climate
intervention_ ) is the deliberate modification of the climate. It has been
investigated as a possible response to global warming, e.g. by NASA[245] and
the Royal Society.[246] Techniques under research fall generally into the
categories solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal, although
various other schemes have been suggested. A study from 2014 investigated the
most common climate engineering methods and concluded they are either
ineffective or have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped
without causing rapid climate change.[247][248]

## Society and culture

### Political response

Stabilizing_the_atmospheric_concentration_of_carbon_dioxide_at_a_constant_level_would_require_emissions_to_be_effectively_eliminated_%28vertical%29_1.svg.png)

Article 2 of the UN Framework Convention refers explicitly to "stabilization
of greenhouse gas concentrations".[249] To stabilize the atmospheric
concentration of CO  
2, emissions worldwide would need to be dramatically reduced from their
present level.[250]

As of 2019[update] all countries in the world are parties to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), but 12 countries have
not ratified it,[251] which means they are not legally bound by the
agreement.[252] The ultimate objective of the Convention is to prevent
dangerous human interference to the climate system.[253] As stated in the
Convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in
the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate
change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be
sustained.[254] The Framework Convention was agreed on in 1992, but global
emissions have risen since then.[255] Its yearly conferences are the stage of
global negotiations.[256]

During these negotiations, the G77 (a lobbying group in the United Nations
representing developing countries)[257] pushed for a mandate requiring
developed countries to "[take] the lead" in reducing their emissions.[258]
This was justified on the basis that the developed countries' emissions had
contributed most to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,
per-capita emissions (i.e., emissions per head of population) were still
relatively low in developing countries, and the emissions of developing
countries would grow to meet their development needs.[259]

This mandate was sustained in the 2005 Kyoto Protocol to the Framework
Convention.[259][260] In ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, most developed
countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions. These
first-round commitments expired in 2012.[260] United States President George
W. Bush rejected the treaty on the basis that "it exempts 80% of the world,
including major population centres such as China and India, from compliance,
and would cause serious harm to the US economy".[261]

In 2009 several UNFCCC Parties produced the Copenhagen Accord,[262][263] which
has been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals, leading
poor nations to reject it.[264][265] Parties associated with the Accord aim to
limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below 2 °C.[266] In
2015 all UN countries negotiated the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep
climate change well below 2 °C. The agreement replaced the Kyoto protocol.
Unlike Kyoto, no binding emission targets are set in the Paris agreement.
Instead, the procedure of regularly setting ever more ambitious goals and
reevaluating these goals every five years has been made binding.[267][268] The
Paris agreement reiterated that developing countries must be financially
supported.[267]

### Scientific discussion

Main article: Scientific opinion on climate change

Scientific discussion takes place in articles that are peer-reviewed and
assessed by scientists who work in the relevant fields and participate in the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The scientific consensus as of
2013[update] stated in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report is that it "is
extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the
observed warming since the mid-20th century".[269]

A 2008 report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences stated that most
scientists by then agreed that observed warming in recent decades was
primarily caused by human activities increasing the amount of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere.[211][270] National science academies have called on world
leaders for policies to cut global emissions.[271]

In 2018 the IPCC published a Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C which
warned that, if the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions is not mitigated,
global warming is likely to reach 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) between 2030 and 2052
causing major crises. The report said that preventing such crises will require
a swift transformation of the global economy that has "no documented historic
precedent".[272]

In the scientific literature, there is an overwhelming consensus that global
surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is
caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.[273] No
scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this
view.[274][275] In November 2017, a second warning to humanity signed by
15,364 scientists from 184 countries stated that "the current trajectory of
potentially catastrophic climate change due to rising greenhouse gases from
burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural production -
particularly from farming ruminants for meat consumption" is "especially
troubling".[276]

### Position of oil and gas companies

See also: Fossil fuels lobby

In the 20th century and early 2000s some companies, such as ExxonMobil,
challenged IPCC climate change scenarios, funded scientists who disagreed with
the scientific consensus, and provided their own projections of the economic
cost of stricter controls.[277] [278][279] [280] In general, since the 2010s,
global oil companies do not dispute that climate change exists and is caused
by the burning of fossil fuels.[281] As of 2019[update], however, some are
lobbying against a carbon tax and plan to increase production of oil and
gas[282] but others are in favour of a carbon tax in exchange for immunity
from lawsuits which seek climate change compensation.[283]

### Public opinion and disputes

_Spring_2007.jpg/170px-Ms._magazine_Cover_-_Spring_2007.jpg)

Global warming was the cover story in this 2007 issue of _Ms._ magazine

The global warming problem came to international public attention in the late
1980s and polling groups began to track opinions on the subject.[284] The
longest consistent polling, by Gallup in the US, found relatively small
deviations of 10% or so from 1998 to 2015 in opinion on the seriousness of
global warming, but with increasing polarization between those concerned and
those unconcerned.[285] By 2010 in the US, just a little over half the
population (53%) viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their
families. Latin America and developed Asia saw themselves most at risk at 73%
and 74%.[286] In the assessed 111 countries, people were more likely to
attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes, except in
the US where nearly half (47%) of the population attributed global warming to
natural causes.[287] Public reactions to global warming and concern about its
effects have been increasing, while many perceiving it as the worst global
threat.[288] A 2015 global survey showed that a median of 54% of respondents
consider it "a very serious problem", with significant regional differences:
Americans and Chinese (whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual
CO2 emissions) are among the least concerned.[22]

From about 1990 onward, American conservative think tanks had begun
challenging the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem. They
challenged the scientific evidence, argued that global warming would have
benefits, and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than
good.[289] Organizations such as the libertarian Competitive Enterprise
Institute, conservative commentators have challenged IPCC climate change
scenarios, funded scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus, and
provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter controls.[277]

Global warming has been the subject of controversy, substantially more
pronounced in the popular media than in the scientific literature,[290][291]
with disputes regarding the nature, causes, and consequences of global
warming. The disputed issues include the causes of increased global average
air temperature, especially since the mid-20th century, whether this warming
trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations, whether humankind
has contributed significantly to it, and whether the increase is completely or
partially an artifact of poor measurements. Additional disputes concern
estimates of climate sensitivity, predictions of additional warming, what the
consequences of global warming will be, and what to do about it.

Due to confusing media coverage in the early 1990s, issues such as ozone
depletion and climate change were often mixed up, affecting public
understanding of these issues.[292] According to a 2010 survey of Americans, a
majority thought that the ozone layer and spray cans contribute to global
warming.[293] Although there are a few areas of linkage, the relationship
between the two is not strong. Reduced stratospheric ozone has had a slight
cooling influence on surface temperatures, while increased tropospheric ozone
has had a somewhat larger warming effect.[294] However, chemicals causing
ozone depletion are also powerful greenhouse gases, and as such the Montreal
protocol against their emissions may have done more than any other measure to
mitigate climate change.[295]

In a response to perceived inaction on climate change, a climate movement is
protesting in various ways, such as fossil fuel divestment,[296] worldwide
demonstrations[297] and the school strike for climate.[298]

## History

The history of climate change science began in the early 19th century when ice
ages and other natural changes in paleoclimate were first suspected and the
natural greenhouse effect first identified.[299] In the late 19th century,
scientists first argued that human emissions of greenhouse gases could change
the climate. In the 1960s, the warming effect of carbon dioxide gas became
increasingly convincing.[300] By the 1990s, as a result of improving fidelity
of computer models and observational work confirming the Milankovitch theory
of the ice ages, a consensus position formed: greenhouse gases were deeply
involved in most climate changes, and human-caused emissions were bringing
discernible global warming. Since then, scientific research on climate change
has expanded.[301] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, set up in
the 1990s to provide formal advice the world's governments, spurred
unprecedented levels of exchange between different scientific
disciplines.[302]

The greenhouse effect was proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824, discovered in
1856 by Eunice Newton Foote,[303][304] expanded upon by John Tyndall,[305]
investigated quantitatively by Svante Arrhenius in 1896,[299] and the
hypothesis was reported in the popular press as early as 1912.[306][307] The
scientific description of global warming was further developed in the 1930s
through the 1960s by Guy Stewart Callendar.[308][309]

## Terminology

Research in the 1950s suggested increasing temperatures, and a 1952 newspaper
reported "climate change". This phrase next appeared in a November 1957 report
in _The Hammond Times_ which described Roger Revelle's research into the
effects of increasing human-caused CO  
2 emissions on the greenhouse effect "a large scale global warming, with
radical climate changes may result". Both phrases were used only occasionally
until 1975, when Wallace Smith Broecker published a scientific paper on the
topic, "Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?"
The phrase began to come into common use, and in 1976 Mikhail Budyko's
statement that "a global warming up has started" was widely reported.[300]
Other studies, such as a 1971 MIT report, referred to the human impact as
"inadvertent climate modification", but an influential 1979 National Academy
of Sciences study headed by Jule Charney followed Broecker in using _global
warming_ to refer to rising surface temperatures, while describing the wider
effects of increased CO  
2 as _climate change_.[310]

In 1986 and November 1987, NASA climate scientist James Hansen gave testimony
to Congress on global warming. There were increasing heatwaves and drought
problems in the summer of 1988, and when Hansen testified in the Senate on 23
June he sparked worldwide interest.[301] He said "global warming has reached a
level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and
effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed
warming".[311] Public attention increased over the summer, and _global
warming_ became the dominant popular term, commonly used both by the press and
in public discourse.[310]

Since 2018 terms such as _global heating_ , the _climate crisis_ , and
_climate emergency_ are increasingly being used instead of _global warming_ or
_climate change_ , in order to emphasis its seriousness and urgency.[312]

Analysis of two available global ocean evaporation datasets confirms this observed intensification of the atmospheric water cycle.
