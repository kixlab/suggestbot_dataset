# Is There a Shortage of Adoptive Families in the United States?

When talking about U.S. families adopting U.S. children, there are essentially
two options. Hopeful parents can pursue a domestic infant adoption, which
typically involves an adoption agency and a birth mother who chooses the
adoptive family. Or, hopeful parents can pursue foster care adoption, which
involves becoming foster parents and being placed with a child who needs to be
adopted.

Each year, thousands of hopeful parents pursue each type of adoption. When an
adoption is completed, it changes the lives of everyone involved in a
beautiful way. But there are still many children who are waiting for a family.

Is there a shortage of adoptive families in the United States? It depends
which type of adoption you’re talking about.

### Domestic Infant Adoption

The domestic infant adoption process is a common way for hopeful parents to
adopt in the U.S. Parents will work with an adoption agency to be placed with
a child. The agency also works with prospective birth mothers who are
considering adoption for their baby. A birth mother will select the adoptive
family she thinks is best for her child, and the adoption will moved forward
from there.

In domestic infant adoption, there is not a shortage of adoptive families.
Typically, a birth mother will have several adoptive family profiles to choose
from. This results in the majority of adoptive parents experiencing an
extended waiting period. For some families, the waiting period can be as short
as a couple months, while others will wait much longer for their adoptive
family profile to be chosen by a prospective birth mother.

While it can be difficult to nail down exactly how many parents seek adoption
each year, it is safe to say that in domestic infant adoption, there are more
hopeful adoptive parents than children in need of adoption. Several estimates
put the number of families who want to adopt each year in the millions,
although not all of these families follow through and actually begin the
adoption process.

In many ways, this is good news. Although the wait times can be difficult for
hopeful parents, these numbers show that babies who need loving families are
finding them through the domestic infant adoption process. The situation in
foster care adoption, however, is much bleaker.

### Foster Care Adoption

There are more than 400,000 children currently in the U.S. foster care system.
The majority of these children are not in need of adoption, because their
biological parents’ rights are still intact. This means that their goal is
reunification — being reunited with their parents after a time apart in foster
care.

However, there are more than 100,000 children in need of adoption from foster
care. And according to reports from the Children’s Bureau, the number of
children waiting for adoption has increased by nearly 17,000 since 2012. In
this situation, when asking if there is a shortage of adoptive families in the
United States, the answer is yes.

Several important numbers help paint a picture of the current situation.

        
                  * More than 60 percent of children in foster care spend two to five years in foster homes before being adopted
          * The average age of children waiting for adoption is 7 years old
          * More than half of the children in need of adoption are over 6 years old
          * There are more boys than girls waiting to be adopted
          * 22 percent of children who need adoption are Hispanic, and 23 percent are black
        

Many reports have detailed a lack of foster parents in the U.S. This need for
parents, paired with increasing numbers of children entering the system, have
led many to call this situation a crisis. Even though more than 50,000
children are adopted from foster care each year, the number of children in
need of adoption is still growing.

An especially vulnerable group in this situation is older children. The
majority of children who need to be adopted are older than 6, but reports have
found that older children are less likely to be adopted. Adopting an older
child can bring unique challenges, such as behavioral issues, developmental
delays or special needs, into your family. Parenting in these circumstances
isn’t always easy, but regardless of how difficult it may be, every child
needs a family. The impact of never finding permanency for children has been
found to be very detrimental.

Anyone who finds themselves disturbed and moved by this information can
contact their local department of children’s services to see how they may be
able to help children in foster care. Even if becoming a foster parent isn’t
right for you, there are still ways to assist your local foster care
community.
