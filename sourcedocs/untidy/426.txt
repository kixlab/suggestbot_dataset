10 Early Signs and Symptoms of Alzheimer's

10 Early Signs and Symptoms of Alzheimer's

Share or Print this page ______

Memory loss that disrupts daily life may be a symptom of Alzheimer's or other
dementia. Alzheimer's is a brain disease that causes a slow decline in memory,
thinking and reasoning skills. There are 10 warning signs and symptoms. If you
notice any of them, don't ignore them. Schedule an appointment with your
doctor.

1

## Memory loss that disrupts daily life

One of the most common signs of Alzheimer's disease, especially in the early
stage, is forgetting recently learned information. Others include forgetting
important dates or events, asking for the same information over and over, and
increasingly needing to rely on memory aids (e.g., reminder notes or
electronic devices) or family members for things they used to handle on their
own.

**What 's a typical age-related change?**  
Sometimes forgetting names or appointments, but remembering them later.

2

## Challenges in planning or solving problems

Some people may experience changes in their ability to develop and follow a
plan or work with numbers. They may have trouble following a familiar recipe
or keeping track of monthly bills. They may have difficulty concentrating and
take much longer to do things than they did before.

**What 's a typical age-related change?**  
Making occasional errors when balancing a checkbook.

####

3

## Difficulty completing familiar tasks at home, at work or at leisure

People with Alzheimer's often find it hard to complete daily tasks. Sometimes,
people may have trouble driving to a familiar location, managing a budget at
work or remembering the rules of a favorite game.

**What 's a typical age-related change?**  
Occasionally needing help to use the settings on a microwave or to record a
television show.

4

## Confusion with time or place

People with Alzheimer's can lose track of dates, seasons and the passage of
time. They may have trouble understanding something if it is not happening
immediately. Sometimes they may forget where they are or how they got there.

**What 's a typical age-related change?**  
Getting confused about the day of the week but figuring it out later.

5

## Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships

For some people, having vision problems is a sign of Alzheimer's. They may
have difficulty reading, judging distance and determining color or contrast,
which may cause problems with driving.

**What 's a typical age-related change?**  
Vision changes related to cataracts.

6

## New problems with words in speaking or writing

People with Alzheimer's may have trouble following or joining a conversation.
They may stop in the middle of a conversation and have no idea how to continue
or they may repeat themselves. They may struggle with vocabulary, have
problems finding the right word or call things by the wrong name (e.g.,
calling a "watch" a "hand-clock").

**What 's a typical age-related change?**  
Sometimes having trouble finding the right word.

7

## Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps

A person with Alzheimer's disease may put things in unusual places. They may
lose things and be unable to go back over their steps to find them again.
Sometimes, they may accuse others of stealing. This may occur more frequently
over time.

**What 's a typical age-related change?**  
Misplacing things from time to time and retracing steps to find them.

8

## Decreased or poor judgment

People with Alzheimer's may experience changes in judgment or decision-making.
For example, they may use poor judgment when dealing with money, giving large
amounts to telemarketers. They may pay less attention to grooming or keeping
themselves clean.

**What 's a typical age-related change?**  
Making a bad decision once in a while.

9

## Withdrawal from work or social activities

A person with Alzheimer's may start to remove themselves from hobbies, social
activities, work projects or sports. They may have trouble keeping up with a
favorite sports team or remembering how to complete a favorite hobby. They
also may avoid being social because of the changes they have experienced.

**What 's a typical age-related change?**  
Sometimes feeling weary of work, family and social obligations.

10

## Changes in mood and personality

The mood and personalities of people with Alzheimer's can change. They can
become confused, suspicious, depressed, fearful or anxious. They may be easily
upset at home, at work, with friends or in places where they are out of their
comfort zone

**What 's a typical age-related change?**  
Developing very specific ways of doing things and becoming irritable when a
routine is disrupted.
