## ABSTRACT

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to achieve and maintain an erection
sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual intercourse. Approximately 23% of men
aged 40-80 years worldwide have symptoms of ED. The prevalence of ED is higher
in older men but can occur at any age. In men with diabetes, the prevalence of
ED ranges between 30-90% and may be the presenting symptom for the disease in
almost a third of cases. In this chapter, we review the physiology of penile
erection and pathophysiology of ED. We review contemporary medical treatments
for ED, surgical options for patients that fail medical management, and novel
therapies in development. We also briefly review priapism, the condition of
prolonged penile erection not associated with sexual desire. For complete
coverage of all related areas of Endocrinology, please visit our on-line FREE

## INTRODUCTION

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to achieve and maintain
an erection sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual intercourse (1). ED may
result from psychological, neurologic, hormonal, arterial, or medication-
induced causes. Approximately 23% of men aged 40-80 years worldwide have
symptoms of ED (2). The prevalence of ED is higher in older men but can occur
at any age (3, 4). In men with diabetes, the prevalence of ED ranges between
30-90% and may be the presenting symptom for the disease in almost a third of
cases (5).

## PHYSIOLOGY OF PENILE ERECTIONS

Penile erection is a neurovascular event modulated by psychological and
hormonal status. The penis is innervated by autonomic and somatic nerves. The
autonomic nervous innervation of the penis consists of sympathetic fibers
(derived from the T11-L2 spinal cord level) and parasympathetic fibers
(derived from the S2-4 spinal cord level) which merge to form the cavernous
nerves in the pelvis. The autonomic nervous innervation of the penis regulates
corporal smooth muscle and arterial contraction and relaxation, which are the
primary drivers of penile tumescence. The somatic innervation of the penis is
controlled by the pudendal nerve, which is responsible for penile sensation
and the contraction and relaxation of the bulbocavernosus and ischiocavernosus
striated muscles. These muscles are relevant to penile tumescence during
maximal penile erection and for expulsion of semen during ejaculation (6, 7).

The penis is flaccid in the resting state. Suppression of penile erection and
maintenance of the flaccid state is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system
and adrenergic nerve terminals. Vascular factors such as endothelin may also
contribute to resting smooth muscle tone in the penis. Smooth muscle tone is
ultimately mediated by activation of the Myosin Light Chain, which tends to
increase contraction. The RhoA/Rho Kinase pathway also plays a critical role
in smooth muscle contraction by suppressing Myosin Light Chain Phosphotase. A
depiction of contractile molecules which mediate penile flaccidity is
presented in Figure 1.

Erection.](/books/NBK278925/bin/male_medical-and-surgical-therapy-of-erectile-

dysfunction-Image001.jpg)

### Figure 1.

Pathways that Promote Contraction and Oppose Erection.

Penile erection is induced in part by suppression of sympathetic tone. A
number of brain center integrate erotic stimuli and contribute to erection by
suppressing the sympathetic nervous system. The neurotransmitter dopamine
appears to play a critical role in central nervous system based stimulation of
erection whereas serotonin plays a mostly (but not universally) inhibitory
role (8, 9).

Erection also requires activation of the parasympathetic nervous system; this
is mediated in large part by release of nitric oxide (NO) from nonadrenergic-
noncholinergic cavernous nerve terminals in the genital vascular system. NO is
produced in nerve tissue by neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase (nNOS). NO
activates soluble guanylyl cyclase, which cleaves guanosine triphosphate (GTP)
to produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP in turn activates cGMP-
specific protein kinases, which phosphorylates certain proteins and ion
channels, resulting in: opening of the potassium channels and
hyperpolarization; sequestration of intracellular calcium by the endoplasmic
reticulum; and inhibition of calcium channels, blocking calcium influx. The
consequence is a drop in cytosolic calcium content.(10) Decline in calcium
content results in smooth muscle relaxation via relaxation of the actin myosin
cross-bridges. There is resultant vasodilation in the arteries and arterioles
supplying the erectile tissue. A several-fold increase in blood flow occurs,
with a concomitant increase in compliance of the corporeal sinusoids from
relaxed cavernous smooth muscle. The increase in blood flow triggers
activation of endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS), the net result of
which is further increase in NO and maintenance/enhancement of
vasodilation(11). A graphical depiction of the NO/cGMP relaxant pathway is
depicted in Figure 2. Additional vasodilation may be accomplished through the
cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate pathway, depicted in Figure 3.

### Figure 3.

The cAMP Pathway in Erection.

With enhancement of corporal blood flow there is rapid filling and expansion
of the corporal sinusoidal system against the tunica albuginea. The subtunical
venular plexuses are compressed between the corporeal sinusoids and the tunica
albuginea, resulting in almost total occlusion of venous outflow (12, 13).
With trapping of blood within the corpora cavernosa the flaccid penis becomes
erect; during the full erection phase intracavernous pressures increases to
approximately 100 mm Hg. With increasing sexual arousal, the bulbocavernosus
reflex is triggered, causing the ischiocavernosus muscles to forcefully
compress the base of the blood-filled corpora cavernosa and the penis. During
this rigid erection phase the penis (including the corpus spongiosum and
glans) becomes very hard, with intracavernous pressure reaching several
hundred mm Hg in some cases. During this phase, arterial inflow and outflow
temporarily cease (14).

With sexual climax or cessation of arousal, the penis returns to the flaccid
state. Flaccidity is initiated in large part by hydrolysis of cGMP to
guanosine monophosphate by phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Other
phosphodiesterases are found in the corpus cavernosum, but they do not appear
to play a major role in detumescence. Detumescence is also mediated by
sympathetic discharge during ejaculation, leading to vasoconstriction and
cessation of NO release from the cavernous nerves and corporal endothelium.
The sub-tunical venous channels open with contraction of the trabecular smooth
muscle, permitting egress of trapped blood and restoring flaccidity (10).

## CLASSIFICATION OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION

ED may be classified as psychogenic, organic (neurogenic, hormonal, arterial,
cavernosal and drug-induced) and mixed. Mixed ED is the most common
encountered having both a psychogenic and organic component (Table 1). Note
that some disease states (e.g. diabetes) may cause ED via multiple mechanisms.

Sexual function progressively declines as men age, although this decline need
not be considered any more "natural" than the development of diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, or any other disease state more common in
the aged. With age, the latency period between sexual stimulation and erection
increases, erections are less turgid, ejaculation is less forceful,
ejaculatory volume decreases, and the refractory period between erections
lengthens (15). In most cases aging is also associated with a decrease in
penile sensitivity to tactile stimulation, a decrease in serum testosterone
concentration, and an increase in cavernous muscle tone (16-18).

Erectile dysfunction is more common in patients with neurologic disorders such
as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, stroke and cerebral trauma (19-21).
This may be due to both a decrease in libido and/or inability to initiate the
erectile process. Spinal cord injury patients have varying degrees of erectile
dysfunction largely dependent on the location and extent of the lesion. Men
with lesions of the sacral spine may have disruption of the sacral reflex arc
and may not respond to genital stimulation. Men with thoracic spinal lesions
may retain reflexogenic erections but lose psychogenic erections which are
generated by suppression of sympathetic penile tone in response to erotic
stimuli. Although erections of some form are often possible in men with spinal
cord injury, they are typically less rigid and of shorter duration compared to
erections in men without spinal cord injury. Even in men without spinal cord
injury, sensory input from the genitalia remains essential to achieving and
maintaining reflexogenic erection. This input may be compromised due to
peripheral neuropathy in men with diabetes (22).

About 50 percent of men with chronic diabetes mellitus are reported to have
ED, although this number dramatically increases with age. In addition to the
disease's effect on small vessels, it may also affect the cavernous nerve
terminals and endothelial cells, resulting in deficiency of neurotransmitters
(10). Additionally, in diabetics, corporal smooth muscle relaxation in
response to neuronal- and endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) is impaired,
possibly due to the accumulation of glycosylation products (23-25).

Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) has frequently been associated with
diminished erectile function, impaired libido and infertility (26, 27).The
mechanism of ED in CRI is likely multifactorial and includes low serum
testosterone, vascular insufficiency, medication-related, depressed libido and
autonomic and somatic neuropathy (28-30). Diabetes is a major risk factor for
CRI and hence CRI is a relevant consideration in diabetic men.

Psychogenic ED may relate to performance anxiety, strained relationship, lack
of sexual arousability, and overt psychiatric disorders such as depression and
schizophrenia (31). The strong relationship between psychogenic stress and
sexual dysfunction is well established (32).

Androgen deficiency is associated with diminished libido and less frequent
nocturnal erections (33). However, erection response is preserved in many men
with low serum testosterone, suggesting that androgens are beneficial but not
essential for erection (34). Men with diabetes are at increased risk of
androgen deficiency and hence serum testosterone testing may be warranted in
diabetic men with or without ED (33). Prolactin is another pituitary hormone
that has inhibitory activity on central dopaminergic activity and
gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion. Hyperprolactinemia has been linked
to reproductive and sexual dysfunction.

Vascular disease is a common and important cause of ED (35). Common vascular
risk factors associated with generalized penile arterial insufficiency include
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, trauma,
and pelvic irradiation (36). Focal stenosis of the common penile artery is not
common but can be a cause of ED in men who have sustained repetitive and/or
severe pelvic or perineal trauma (e.g. biking accidents, pelvic fractures)
(37).

Veno-occlusive dysfunction (VOD) results from disruption of the blood trapping
capacity of the tunica albuginea of the corpora. In this situation there may
be inadequate compression of the subtunical venules during the full erection
phase (38). Venous leak impotence may also be the result of degenerative
changes that affect the penis including Peyronie's disease, penile scarring,
and diabetes mellitus. A patient may develop VOD from traumatic injury to the
tunica albuginea such as a penile fracture. Venous leak can also be seen in
anxious men with excessive adrenergic tone causing structural alterations of
the cavernous smooth muscle and endothelium and insufficient trabecular smooth
muscle relaxation (16).

Virtually all drugs have been associated with ED although some classes are
more prone to sexual side effects than others. Central neurotransmitter
pathways, including serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways
involved in sexual function, may be disturbed by antipsychotics and
antidepressants (39). Although any antihypertensive agent could theoretically
cause ED by decreasing the availability of blood to the corporal arteries
(i.e. a pressure-head phenomenon), differences are noted between various
classes of medications (40). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and
angiotensin receptor blockers are relatively less likely to cause ED. Beta-
adrenergic blocking drugs may lead to erectile dysfunction by potentiating a-1
adrenergic activity in the penis, although more modern beta blockers with eNOS
activity (such as nebivolol) may help minimize this effect (41). Thiazide
diuretics have been reported to cause erectile dysfunction by an unknown
mechanism (42). Anti-androgens are another common drug type that may
contribute to ED (43).

Recreational drugs including cigarettes and alcohol also affect erectile
function. Cigarette smoking may induce vasoconstriction and penile venous
leakage because of its contractile effect on the cavernous smooth muscle. More
importantly, chronic use may accelerate atherosclerotic changes in penile
microvasculature (44). Alcohol in small amounts may improve erections and
increase libido because of its vasodilatory effect and the suppression of
performance anxiety. However, large amounts of alcohol can cause central
sedation, decreased libido and transient erectile dysfunction. Chronic
alcoholism may cause hypogonadism and polyneuropathy; this may in turn affect
penile nerve function (45).

## EVALUATION OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION

Erectile dysfunction may be the first manifestation of many disease states,
including diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia,
hypertension, spinal-cord compression, pituitary tumors, and pelvic
malignancies. ED is a sentinel event for major adverse cardiac events and is
therefore an indication for formal cardiovascular evaluation (35). The
evaluation of a patient with ED requires a thorough history (medical, sexual
and psycho-social), physical examination and appropriate laboratory tests
(creatinine, fasting glucose, lipid profile, total testosterone, and
bioavailable or free testosterone) aimed at detecting underlying metabolic
disease states (46, 47). If the man's testosterone concentration (free, total,
or bioavailable) is low, serum prolactin and luteinizing hormone should be
assayed to detect abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (33).

After assessing the therapeutic needs and goals of the patient and his
partner, further diagnostic and treatment options can be offered. There should
be an inquiry on the patient's sexual partner; the partner should be involved
in treatment planning and decision making (47). In men who do not have a
sexual partner, there should be discussion about goals in terms of future
sexual relationships. Decisions on treatment should be based on patient (and
partner) goals and level of risk tolerance.

The patient's performance status and cardiovascular health should be
evaluated, in consultation with a cardiologist if necessary, in order to
assess the patient's ability to tolerate sexual activity (48). Patients who
have poor exercise tolerance should consider physical conditioning prior to
resuming sexual activity (48). Exercise, healthy diet and weight loss may be
sufficient to partially restore erection response in some men (49).

Men with complex ED may benefit from a referral for further testing and
treatment (Table 2). The indications for specialty referral include complex
gonadal or other endocrine disorders, neurologic deficit suggestive of brain
or spinal cord disease, deep-seated psychologic or psychiatric problems, post-
traumatic or lifelong erectile dysfunction and unstable cardiovascular
disease.

Peyronie's Disease (PD) is an acquired fibrotic disorder of the penis that
merits specific mention in the context of managing ED (50). The condition
remains poorly understood but is thought to involve a genetic predisposition
to collagen deposition and inflammation in connective tissues. Men with PD are
at increased risk of other fibrotic conditions including Dupuytren's
Contractures and tympanosclerosis (50).

PD was once thought to be quite rare; with the introduction of highly
effective therapy for ED many cases of PD that might have once gone
unrecognized are now diagnosed. Prevalence estimates vary but signs of PD may
be detected by experienced examiners in approximately 9% of men presenting for
evaluation by a urologist (51).

The classical manifestation of PD is penile curvature but the disorder may
also be associated with pain, narrowing, corporal fibrosis and hinging (50).
The single US FDA approved medical therapy for PD is penile injections of
Clostridial collagenase with penile modeling; this therapy has been associated
with modest but significant improvements in penile curvature compared to
placebo injections (52, 53). In cases of severe deformity and/or failure of
medical therapy, surgical intervention may be required. Surgery for PD can
take the form of 1) plication of the convex side of the penis with sutures to
induce straightening, 2) incision with grafting of the concave or narrowed
portion of the corpora, or 3) placement of a penile prosthetic device in cases
where there is concomitant severe ED (54, 55).

### Androgens

Historically, androgens were thought to enhance male sexual function. However,
androgen therapy has only been shown to be of clinical benefit in men with low
serum testosterone and symptoms potentially referable to hypogonadism (33).
There is some controversy over what constitutes a "low" level of testosterone
but a cut off for total testosterone between 300 and 400 ng/dL and free
testosterone less than 65 pg/mL has general support (56). The benefit of
supplementation in men with low serum testosterone primarily pertains to
libido but improvements in erectile function (57, 58) as well as improvements
in response to PDE5I have been reported in select populations (59).

Testosterone cypionate and enanthate are often used for intramuscular
replacement therapy; a standard dosing regimen is 200 mg intramuscularly
although different dosing regimens have been described. Lower doses at shorter
intervals may produce less pronounced variation in serum testosterone levels
between doses.

Several daily transdermal testosterone preparations (testosterone patches or
gels) are available. Daily application of these preparations raises serum
testosterone concentrations to within the normal range in over 90 percent of
men. The most common adverse effects of testosterone patches are skin
irritation and contact dermatitis. Gel formulations are less prone to skin
irritation but care must be taken to avoid skin-to-skin contact and transfer
of testosterone to others (e.g. spouse, children) for at least 2 hours post
dosing (33).

Recent refinements in testosterone supplementation include novel testosterone
pellets, which are implanted in a minor office procedure and provide 2-4
months of therapeutic testosterone levels (60). A ten week depot testosterone
preparation was recently approved for use in the United States; this long
acting formulation may obviate the need for frequent injections (61). These
long acting formulations may be considered for patients who have tolerated
shorter acting formulations and reported significant benefit.

Testosterone treatment may contribute to polycythemia, acne, edema, and
decreased HDL cholesterol. Testosterone may also lead to estrogen by
aromatization in adipose tissue; this may lead to gynecomastia and
theoretically to higher risk of deep venous thrombosis. Men receiving androgen
replacement therapy require routine follow up appointments with measurement of
hematocrit, serum testosterone and PSA. It is prudent to have more frequent
checks in the early phase after initiation of therapy (33).

Due to the well-established benefits of surgical or medical castration for the
management of advanced prostate cancer there has been a long-standing concern
that testosterone supplementation may increase the risk of prostate cancer.
This relationship is based primarily on conjecture; there is an emerging body
of literature which suggests that testosterone supplementation does not
materially alter the risk of prostate cancer development (62). There is
limited evidence that men with low serum testosterone may be at greater risk
of aggressive prostate cancer (63), although there is currently no evidence
that supplementation moderates this risk. In several small case series, men
with successfully treated prostate cancer have been reported to have used
testosterone supplements with no increase in risk for PSA recurrence. Some
authors have also reported continued testosterone supplementation in men with
untreated prostate cancer; until more data are available providers in general
practice should exercise caution with respect to testosterone supplementation
in men with untreated prostate cancer (64, 65).

The issue of cardiac safety and testosterone has received a great deal of
media attention over the past several years. High profile publications in
prestigious journals have reported increased rates of cardiovascular events
and mortality in men using testosterone supplements (66, 67). Testosterone is
known to exert several effects that may increase cardiac risk. At the same
time, the known benefits of testosterone include increased lean body mass,
decreased adiposity, and improved insulin sensitivity (68, 69). Men with low
serum testosterone are known to be at greater risk of all-cause mortality
(70). Higher rates of cardiac events in men taking testosterone supplement may
be due to baseline risk rather than additional risk from supplementation.

### Type 5 Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors (PDE5I)

Oral therapy with a type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDE5I, e.g.sildenafil,
vardenafil, tadalafil, and avanafil) is considered first line therapy in men
with ED (71). PDE5I block the inactivation of cGMP and result in increased
smooth muscle relaxation and penile arterial blood flow. In the absence of
sexual stimulation these medications have no effect on the penis. Numerous
placebo-controlled studies have been conducted on the safety and efficacy of
sildenafil since it was approved for clinical use in 1998 (72). Sildenafil has
been consistently show to increase number of erections, penile rigidity,
orgasmic function, and overall sexual satisfaction compared to placebo in men
with ED of every etiology, including diabetes (73, 74). Similar data exist for
the other drugs in this class.

Most clinical trials of PDE-5 inhibitors show only mild to moderate, self-
limited adverse events associated with all of the PDE-5 inhibitors (75). The
most common complaints in men using PDE-5 inhibitors are headache (16
percent), flushing (10 percent), dyspepsia (7 percent), nasal congestion (4
percent), and visual disturbances/ color sensitivity (3 percent). Tadalafil
distinguishes itself from vardenafil and sildenafil by the relative lack of
visual side effects. It does however have the possible adverse effect of back
pain and/or myalgia (76).

PDE5I have an excellent track record of cardiac safety (77). To date, tens of
millions of men in over 100 countries have used sildenafil (75). Since the
release of the drug, over 200 deaths temporally associated with sildenafil
therapy were reported to the Food and Drug Administration in the United States
of America. Sexual activity was thought to be a likely contributor to
myocardial infarction, with sildenafil acting to enable men not previously
active to engage in sexual activity (78, 79). PDE5I therapy is safe for most
men, although men with cardiovascular disease should consult with their
cardiologist prior to engaging in sexual activity. The Princeton III
guidelines provide recommendations for management of ED in men with
cardiovascular disease. Princeton III recommends risk stratification before
initiation of therapy; men at low-risk may be treated whereas men with high-
risk (e.g. recent MI, unstable angina, NYHA Class III or IV heart failure,
unstable arrythmia) should not be treated until their situation stabilizes.
Men who do not fall neatly into low- or high-risk categories should undergo
cardiac evaluation (48).

A lower starting dose (25 mg of sildenafil, 5 mg of vardenafil or tadalafil,
50 mg of avanafil) is recommended in patients who may attain and maintain
higher plasma levels of PDE5I. These include patients who are older than 65,
have severe renal impairment, or take potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors. Patients
who take ritonavir should not take more than 25 mg of Sildenafil in a 48-hour
period.

Patients using PDE5I and requiring alpha-blocker therapy for hypertension or
benign prostate hyperplasia should start at low doses of PDE5 inhibitor, which
can be titrated to affect. To avoid symptomatic hypotension, PDE5 inhibitors
should not be taken within 4 hours of an alpha-blocker. One study found a
significant rate of hypotension (28% versus 6% with placebo) in patients
taking concomitant doxazosin and tadalafil (80). The rate of hypotension
matched that seen in placebo-treated patients in patients taking tamsulosin
and tadalafil, and some studies suggest that the interaction has less clinical
relevance in patients who have undergone long-term alpha-blocker therapy. It
is likely that all four PDE5I commercially available in the US interact to
some degree with alpha-blockers and that concurrent use of alpha-blockers and
PDE5I may cause patients to develop orthostatic hypotension. Other
antihypertensive agents appear to be well tolerated by men concurrently taking
PDE5I.

Non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) and PDE5I use has garnered a
great deal of attention in both scientific and lay publications. Spontaneous
NAION is the most common acute optic neuropathy and ranks second only to
glaucoma as a cause of acquired optic neuropathy for men aged 50 and older.
Estimated annual incidence is 2.3 to 10.3 per 100,000 and is more common in
Caucasians than African Americans, Asians, or Hispanics. Most patients do not
become legally blind, but the degree of visual acuity and visual field loss is
typically significant. Risk factors common to NAION and ED include
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, age over 50 years,
coronary artery disease, and smoking (81, 82). A large review of ophthalmology
records in the United States and Europe reported a very slight but
statistically significant relationship between NAION and PDE5I use within the
last 30 days. The authors concluded that use of PDE5I may be associated with
an increase of approximately three NAION cases per 100,000 men over the age of
50 (83, 84). Men using PDE5I should be counseled to stop treatment and contact
their physician immediately should visual changes or loss occur. Men with a
history of NAION should not use PDE5 inhibitors (85).

PDE5I have also been implicated in several cases of hearing loss. Several
dozen cases of PDE5 inhibitor associated hearing loss have been reported and
some research has indicated mechanisms by which hearing loss may be
attributable to action of these drugs (86, 87). Men who experience hearing
impairment while using PDE5 inhibitors should halt treatment until they are
able to speak with their doctors regarding long-term risk of hearing loss.

1.

Men using nitrate drugs should not use PDE5I. If a man develops angina and has
taken a PDE5I he should present to the ER rather than taking a short acting
nitrate drug (e.g. nitroglycerin).

* * *

2.

Men with stable coronary disease not needing nitrates on a consistent basis
may take PDE5I if the risks of the medication have been carefully discussed
with the patients by their physician. If the patient routinely requires
nitrates for mild or moderate exercise induced angina, PDE5I should not be
prescribed.

3.

All men taking an organic nitrate (including recreational amyl nitrate) should
be informed about the nitrate/PDE5I hypotensive interaction.

4.

Men must be warned of the danger of taking PDE5I in the 24-hour period before
or after taking a nitrate preparation.

5.

Pre-PDE5I stress testing may be indicated in some men with cardiac disease to
assess the risk of cardiac ischemia during sexual intercourse.

6.

Initial monitoring of blood pressure after taking PDE5I may be indicated in:
men with congestive heart failure who have borderline low blood pressure and
low volume status; and men being treated with a complicated, multidrug
antihypertensive regimen.

#### SILDENAFIL

Sildenafil (Viagra®, Pfizer) works best when taken on an empty stomach and
reaches maximum plasma concentrations within 30 to 120 minutes (mean 60
minutes). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism, and the
terminal half-life is about 4 hours. The recommended starting dose is 50 mg
taken one hour before sexual activity. The maximal recommended frequency is
once per day. Absorption of sildenafil is impaired by high fat foods. The
efficacy of sildenafil has been extensively studied in patients with other
coexisting diseases (89). No significant difference in response rate was noted
comparing a normal cohort of patients with patients with hypertension (80),
spinal cord injury (90), depression (91), prostate surgery (92), diabetes (93)
and the elderly (94). Patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy have a
lower response rate to sildenafil compared to a cohort of patients who had ED
unrelated to pelvic surgery (92) (Table 5).

#### VARDENAFIL

Vardenafil (Levitra® and Staxyn®, Bayer/GSK) is a potent and highly selective
PDE5I. Its chemical structure is quite similar to sildenafil however in _in
vitro_ studies the selectivity and potency of vardenafil are superior. The
medication can be given in either 10 or 20 mg oral dosage (Levitra ®) or a 10
mg sublingual dissolving lozenge (Staxyn®). The time to peak plasma
concentration is 40-55 minutes. Vardenafil has been shown to be highly
efficacious in a wide range of clinical indications (95, 96). In one
multicenter phase III trial patients with diabetes (type I and II) were found
to respond to 20 mg dosage of vardenafil significantly better than a similar
control group. The effect also seemed to improve after 12 weeks of treatment
(97). Although similar in chemical structure, the _in vitro_ potency and
selectivity of vardenafil are superior to that of sildenafil. Robust evidence
that these _in vitro_ effects translate to superior results _in vivo_ are
lacking.

Several newer studies have demonstrated vardenafil to have a faster onset of
action than seen with other medications of the same class. In particular, one
study (ONTIME) found that 21% of men with moderate to severe erectile
dysfunction obtained erections of sufficient firmness for sexual intercourse
at 11 minutes after using 20 mg of Vardenafil. At 25 minutes, 53% of patients
obtained erections sufficient enough for penetration as compared to placebo
(26%). The statistically superior response to vardenafil versus placebo was
observed in all times from 11-25 minutes (98). Like sildenafil, absorption of
vardenafil is impaired when the medication is taken after a high fat meal
(99). The side effects most frequently seen with vardenafil include flushing,
dyspepsia, headache and visual disturbances (100). Adverse events reported in
men taking vardenafil closely resemble those in men taking sildenafil and
tadalafil. Headache (21%), flushing (13%), dyspepsia (6%) are seen at various
frequencies depending on dosages used.

#### TADALAFIL

Tadalafil (Cialis®, Eli Lilly, USA) is a PDE5I which has a distinctly
different chemical structure from vardenafil and sildenafil (76). Because
tadalafil has lower affinity for PDE-6 (localized to the eye) it is associated
with a low incidence of visual side effects. Tadalafil is dosed at 5, 10,and
20 mg on demand and is also available as a daily dose medication at 2.5 and 5
mg. Tadalafil's erection potentiating effect may onset within 30-45 minutes of
dosing but may last as long as 24-48 hours (101). As with the other PDE5I the
side effect profile of this medication is quite mild. In addition to the lack
of visual side effects, it also tends to have a reduced incidence of facial
flushing compared to the other PDE5I. The incidence of back/muscle pain is
generally higher with tadalafil as compared to other PDE5I. Absorption of
tadalafil is minimally impacted upon by food intake. An integrated analysis
from five randomized control double blind placebo trials revealed that men
with varying severities of ED significantly improved with Tadalafil therapy at
10 and 20 mg dosages. The mean IIEF score (International Index of Erectile
Dysfunction score) increased by 6.5 and 7.9 at the 10 and 20 mg dosage of
tadalafil. This increase was statistically significant compared to placebo
(102). In pharmacological studies tadalafil appears to be rapidly absorbed and
reaches a peak serum concentration by 2 hours. The uniqueness of tadalafil
appears to be in that its half-life is approximately 17.5 hours. The
absorption and excretion of tadalafil does not appear to be affected by food
or alcohol. With a 17.5 hour half-life tadalafil has a period of
responsiveness of up to 36 hours. In a study of the delayed efficacy of
tadalafil, at 36 hours post dose 62% of men taking the 20 mg treatment dose
reported successful sexual intercourse compared to 33% of men who had taken
placebo (103).

Like sildanafil and vardenafil, tadalafil potentiates the hypotensive effects
of nitric oxide and it is therefore contraindicated in patients taking nitrate
medications. Tadalafil appears to be very well tolerated in most studies. The
most frequently reported adverse events are headache and dyspepsia. Back pain,
nasal congestion, myalgia and nasal congestion have also been reported but
tend to be mild. The rate of treatment discontinuation from adverse events is
low at 2.2% compared with the placebo discontinuation rate of 1.3% (102).

#### AVANAFIL

A fourth PDE5 inhibitor called avanafil (stendra®, Vivus) was approved for use
in the United States in May of 2012 and became commercially available in 2014
(104). The chemical structure of avanafil differs from that of the three other
drugs from the PDE5 inhibitor class. Avanafil is available in 50, 100, and 200
mg dosing and is efficacious in men with diabetes related ED (104). Avanafil
is distinguished by having a rapid onset of action and a half-life of
approximately 5-10 hours (105). The side effect profile is relatively similar
to other drugs from the PDE5 inhibitor class (106).

#### PDE-5 INHIBITORS AND CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY

Controlled and post-marketing studies of the four FDA-approved PDE-5
inhibitors have demonstrated no increase in myocardial infarction or death
rates in either double-blind, placebo-controlled trials or open-label studies
when compared with expected rates in the study populations. Patients with
known coronary artery disease or heart failure receiving PDE-5 inhibitors did
not exhibit worsening ischemia, coronary vasoconstriction, or worsening
hemodynamics on exercise testing or cardiac catheterization (48). PDE-5
inhibitors have a minimal effect on QTc interval. However, caution should be
exercised in patients who take type-1A antiarrhythmics (such as quinidine or
procainamide), type-3 antiarrhythmics (such as sotalol or amiodarone), or in
patients with congenital prolonged QT syndrome (107).

The vasodilator effects of PDE5 inhibitors may be more marked in patients with
hypertension or coronary artery disease. As with all vasodilators, caution is
advised in certain conditions: aortic stenosis, left ventricular outflow
obstruction, hypotension and hypovolemia (48, 88). Caution is advised when an
alpha-blocker and a PDE-5 inhibitor are taken within a close time frame, as a
drug interaction can lead to excessive vasodilation and hypotension (80).

Nitrates are absolutely contraindicated in patients taking PDE5I (88). These
include organic nitrates, including sublingual nitroglycerin, isosorbide
mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate and other nitrate preparations used to treat
angina, as well as amyl nitrite or amyl nitrate (so-called "poppers," a
recreational drug). Past use of nitrates, e.g. more than two weeks before the
use of PDE5I, is not considered a contraindication. Patients who develop
angina during sexual activity with a PDE5I should be instructed to discontinue
sexual activity and seek emergency medical care if the pain persists. The
patient should inform emergency medical personnel that a PDE5I was taken.
Sublingual nitroglycerin should not be taken in this context as this may lead
to serious hypotension.

Several strategies may salvage men who report failure with PDE5 inhibitors. An
important first step is re-education on the correct use of the medications.
Many patients need to be reminded that these medications are reliant on
central mechanisms and that they will not work well without erotic
stimulation. Up to 55% of sildenafil initial non-responders will respond after
education (108). Dose titration may be necessary. Sildenafil, vardenafil, and
avanafil tend to absorb more slowly (and hence have lower efficacy) after a
high fat meal; tadalafil absorption is less dependent on timing of meals.
Assay of serum testosterone should also be considered in PDE5 inhibitor
failures as these medications are at least partially androgen-dependent;
improved efficacy after testosterone replacement in hypogonadal men has been
observed in numerous studies (59, 109) and a meta-analysis of testosterone
trials (110). A randomized controlled trial of testosterone therapy in men
with ED did not show additive benefit from supplementation. However, this
study was limited in that, during the pre-testosterone treatment run-in phase
of the trial with administration of a PDE5I drug, mean serum testosterone
levels improved to above the enrollment criterion of 330 mg/dL in both the
placebo and testosterone treatment arms (111). The mechanism of the
testosterone increase during the run-in in these cohorts is unclear but
complicates interpretation of these data.

### Other Treatments of Erectile Dysfunction

In patients for whom PDE5I or are contraindicated, alternative management
options include the vacuum constriction device (VCD), trans-urethral
suppositories (MUSE®) and intra-cavernous injection (ICI) therapy (71).

#### VACUUM CONSTRICTION DEVICES (VCD)

VCD produces erection via vacuum suctioning of venous blood into the corporal
spaces. Blood is subsequently trapped with a constriction device placed at the
base of the phallus. Its potential side effects include discomfort, petechiae,
numbness, and interference with ejaculation (71). The erection induced by the
VCD is based on trapping of venous blood and therefore the erection may be
colder and less firm than natural erections. Some men also experience pain
and/or difficulty with operating the device. No constrictive device should be
left on the penis for more than 30 minutes and the device should be promptly
removed if there are signs of numbness or ischemia.

#### MUSE

The Medicated Urethral Suppository for Erections (MUSE®) is a transurethral
prostaglandin suppository that has several advantages including local
application, minimal systemic effects, and the rarity of drug interaction.
However, this type of secondary treatment has failed to gain popularity due to
its major drawbacks including moderate to severe penile pain, low response
rate and inconsistent efficacy (112). It has been extensively studied in
Europe and the United States and was found to be effective in 43 percent of
men with erectile dysfunction of various organic causes. The most common side
effects were penile pain (32 percent) and urethral pain or burning (12
percent) (113). Using an adjustable constriction device placed at the base of
the penis after MUSE administration resulted in an increase in successful
sexual intercourse in 69 percent of men (114). The standard starting dose for
MUSE® is 500-μg dosed in the office. Depending on the patient's response, this
dose can be titrated from 250-1000 μg. It is important to administer the test
dose in the office due to the risks of urethral bleeding, vasovagal reflex,
hypotension, and priapism that can occur with this medication.

#### INTRACAVERNOUS MEDICATIONS

There are several intracavernous medications available for the treatment of ED
including papaverine, alprostadil, phentolamine and atropine (71, 115). Men
must receive appropriate training and education by medical personnel before
beginning home injections. The goal is to achieve an erection that is adequate
for sexual intercourse but does not last for more than four hours. The two
major side effects of intracavernous injection are priapism and fibrosis
(penile deviation, nodules or plaque). Priapism is preventable through careful
dose titration. Post-injection compression is recommended to reduce the
likelihood of bleeding or bruising.

In the U.S., the most commonly used (and only FDA approved) intracavernous
drug is alprostadil. Alprostadil's efficacy is superior to papaverine alone
and it results in erections in more than 70 percent of treated men.(115) The
usual dose ranges from 5 to 40 μg. The most frequent side effect is painful
erections that occur in 17 to 34 percent of men (115, 116). This hyperalgesic
effect is most prominent in men with partial nerve injury, such as those with
diabetic neuropathy and those who have undergone radical pelvic surgery.
Alprostadil has a relatively low incidence of priapism (0.35 to 4 percent) and
fibrosis (1 to 23 percent) (117, 118).

Papaverine is a non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases cAMP
and cGMP concentrations in penile erectile tissue (119). It is usually dosed
at 15 to 60 mg. It is more effective in psychogenic and neurogenic erectile
dysfunction (up to 80 per cent) compared to vasculogenic (36-50 per cent). Its
advantages include low cost and stability at room temperature. Its major
disadvantages are priapism (up to 35 percent when taken in large doses),
corporal fibrosis (up to 33 percent although the clinical relevance of mild
fibrosis is debatable) and occasional perturbations in serum liver enzyme
levels.

Phentolamine is a competitive alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist. It is most
often used in combination with papaverine to produce rigid erections (63-87%
success rates) (119, 120). Most urologists recommend a combination of 30 mg
papaverine and 0.5 to 1 mg phentolamine. The potential side effects of
phentolamine include hypotension and reflex tachycardia.

Combinations of injectable medications may be superior to single medications
in terms of efficacy and side effect profile. The most common intracavernous
therapies used in the U.S. are two or three-drug mixtures containing
papaverine, phentolamine and/or alprostadil (typically known as Bimix or
Trimix) in varying concentrations. The usual dose of mixed solution ranges
from 0.1 to 0.5 ml. Although widely used in the U.S., these solutions are not
approved by the FDA. Some experts also promote the addition of a fourth drug
(often atropine) to trimix to create "quadmix"; the efficacy of this
formulation has not been extensively studied.

Although the response rate to injection therapy is high, in long-term studies
38 to 80 percent of men cease to use the treatment over time (121, 122). To
avoid the cumbersome nature of injection therapy, some men alternate injection
therapy with sildenafil or MUSE®, preferring injection in circumstances when
an erection of longer duration is desired. Alternatively, in men whom
injection therapy alone fails or is insufficient, we recommend the use of
injection therapy in combination with a vacuum constriction device.

#### OTHER DRUGS

Yohimbine (alpha 2-adrenetric receptor antagonist) (123), apomorphine
(dopmaniergic agonist) (124), and bremelanotide (a melanocortin analog) (125,
126) have been investigated for ED but are not currently accepted standard
treatments for ED.

## SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION

Surgery is indicated for the management of ED refractory to medical
management. One of the earliest contemporary surgical approaches to ED was
described by Wooten in 1902, who recommended ligation of the dorsal vein of
the penis as a means for restoring erections (127). The superficially placed
rigid prosthesis made from synthetic material soon followed (128). These early
prostheses tended to shift under the penile skin and were generally
unsatisfactory.

The modern penile prosthesis originated in the 1970s; these devices were
revolutionary in that they were designed to be placed within the corpora
cavernosa. Although early models had substantial limitations, these devices
were the first penile prosthetics to provide good functional and cosmetic
results (129, 130). Penile arterial bypass surgery was also first reported as
a treatment for ED in the 1970s (131). Venous surgery for ED was re-introduced
with modifications in the early 1980s to treat corporal veno-occlusive
dysfunction (132).

While penile prosthetic devices are generally effective for a wide range of
patients, vascular surgery (both arterial and venous) for ED has been
effective only in very select patients, typically healthy young men with
either congenital or traumatic ED. Penile prosthesis placement is the standard
surgical treatment for ED.

### Arterial Revascularization

Arterial revascularization offers patients the possibility of restoration of
normal erectile function without the necessity of medications, injections or
devices. Penile arterial bypass surgery was first described in the early 1970s
(131) and has undergone many modifications since its early description. Penile
arterial insufficiency is most frequently the result of general
arteriosclerosis associated with medical conditions such as
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus.
In patients with arterial insufficiency from these entities, penile
revascularization is unlikely to be of benefit as penile small vessel disease
is likely to be present. Healthy young men with traumatic disruption of a
discrete segment of the penile vasculature are the population who has the
greatest chance of benefit from penile arterial revascularization (133).

Penile arterial insufficiency is diagnosed by performing an intracavernous
injection test followed by self-stimulation (audiovisual or manual). Duplex
ultrasonography of the penis performed during injection and stimulation test
can help delineate echogenicity of corporal tissues, peak flow velocity of
cavernosal arteries, thickness of tunica albuginea and cavernosal arteries,
diameter and wave form of arteries. If arterial insufficiency is confirmed,
selective penile/pudendal arteriogram is necessary to identify penile vascular
anatomy, demonstrate communication between cavernosal and dorsal arteries and
confirm location of obstructive/traumatized arterial lesion (134).

Several techniques of revascularization have been described (135). Anastomosis
of the epigastric artery to the dorsal penile artery (revascularization) or
the deep dorsal vein (arterialization) is a common approach. Long term results
in these patients is highly variable. Careful selection and refinements in
technique can improve success rates. Young men with arterial insufficiency
secondary to pelvic trauma are the ideal patients for this procedure (136).
The most frequent side effect with penile arterialization is glans hyperemia.
This can occur in up to 13% of patients who have undergone epigastric artery-
deep dorsal vein anastomosis. Other potential complications include infection,
hematoma and thrombosis of anastomosis.

### Venous Surgery

Venogenic dysfunction is often suspected during evaluation by the finding of a
sub-optimal erectile response to intracavernosal injection despite a normal
arterial response on duplex Doppler sonography (134). The presence of
persistent end-diastolic flow of greater than 5 cm/sec on duplex sonography
may signify venous leak ED. Appropriate conduct of duplex sonography requires
repeat dosing of erectogenic agents; this is omitted by some practitioners and
may contribute to a false positive finding of venous leak in a patient who
would have a normal response to repeat dosing (134).

The gold standard confirmatory test for the diagnosis of venous leak ED is
dynamic infusion cavernosometry and cavernosography (DICC). Cavernosometry and
cavernosography can be used to document the severity of venous leakage as well
as visualize the sites of leakage (137). Like duplex Doppler ultrasound of the
penis, these procedures require administration of an erectogenic agent. An
abnormal cavernosometry result is 1) an intracavernosal infusion rate of
greater than 10cc/minute of saline to maintain the erection or 2) a drop of
intracavernosal pressure of greater than 50 mmHg within 30 seconds of
terminating the saline infusion (138, 139). An abnormal cavernosogram
(performed immediately after cavernosometry) shows visualization of penile
veins or venous leakage from the crura on films taken immediately after
intracavernous injection of diluted contrast.

The results of penile venous surgery are mixed and many experts recommend
against it. There is wide spread agreement that only young patients with
clearly defined and visualized venous leakage on cavernosogram should be
offered venous surgery for ED. Patients with generalized penile venous disease
should be offered penile prostheses as it is unlikely that adequate ligation
can be accomplished in these men without obliterating arterial inflow (133).

### Prosthetic Surgery

When there is lack of efficacy or dissatisfaction with medical management of
ED, penile prosthesis placement is the procedure of choice for restoration of
penile rigidity (55). Penile prosthesis surgery is irreversible in that
corporal tissue is permanently altered such that physiologic erections are no
longer possible. Contemporary prostheses include two or three- piece hydraulic
pumps and semi-rigid/malleable rods.

Most malleable prostheses are made of silicone rubber with a central
intertwined metallic core. The advantages of malleable devices are that they
are easy to implant, easy to operate, and have few mechanical parts with
minimal risk for mechanical failure. The major disadvantage of the semi-rigid
devices is that the penis is never fully rigid nor fully flaccid. These
devices may interfere with urination, are difficult to conceal, and have a
higher likelihood of device erosion. Malleable prosthesis is most commonly
utilized in resource poor settings or for patients who want a device of
minimal complexity (55). Examples of malleable prostheses are presented in
Figures 4 and 5.

### Figure 5.

Two-piece inflatable prostheses consist of a pair of cylinders attached to a
scrotal pump. The reservoir is in the proximal portion of the cylinders. The
prosthesis can be deflated by bending the penis at mid-shaft. While these
devices permit some appearance of flaccidity, the lack of a separate reservoir
does limit the amount of detumescence that can be attained. These devices
represent a compromise between ease of use/placement and potential for
expansion (55). A two-piece penile prosthesis is shown in Figure 6.

### Figure 6.

Three-piece inflatable prostheses are the gold standard for treatment of
medically refractory ED. These devices consist of paired penile cylinders, a
scrotal pump, and a reservoir for saline that is placed in the suprapubic
space or posterior to the rectus fascia. Three-piece prostheses provide
excellent rigidity when erect and a more natural appearance when flaccid. When
fully erect, they are as rigid as the two-piece device. In the flaccid state,
they surpass flaccidity of two-piece prostheses (55). Hydraulic three-piece
penile implants account for about 85% of the US market. Examples of three-
piece penile prosthesis are presented in Figures 7 and 8.

Prostheses have very high satisfaction rates (>90%) in management of ED and
modern prosthetics are very durable with mean lifespans of 10-15 years
(140-143). This high satisfaction rate is likely due to the capacity of
prostheses to allow for spontaneous and repeated reliable erections without
external medications or devices. However, men willing to undergo implantation
of a penile prosthetic are a self-selecting group and may not be
representative of the general male population with ED.

Infection remains the most devastating and feared complication of penile
implant surgery. Modern prostheses allow for antibiotic impregnation and
elution (144). In the setting of high volume surgeons, infection rates are
less than 2% for first-time prosthesis (145). Although some studies suggest
that elevated HbA1c levels may predict a higher rate of infections in
diabetics having penile prosthesis surgery, more recent studies refute this.
Elevated HbA1c may not be a risk factor for infection but poor short-term
blood sugar control (defined by morning fasting glucose levels >200 ng/ml) was
associated with higher infection risk (146).

Patients must be counseled that it may take a significant amount of time to
become comfortable operating penile implants. Many men express dissatisfaction
with penile length after prosthesis placement; careful counseling and setting
reasonable expectations may help mitigate post-operative concerns.

## PRIAPISM

Priapism is a prolonged penile erection in the absence of sexual stimulation.
Two subtypes of priapism have been described; current nomenclature
differentiates these as non-ischemic and ischemic (147, 148).

### Non-Ischemic Priapism

Non-ischemic (formerly known as high-flow) priapism, is relatively rare. In
this scenario, injury to a cavernosal artery, usually after perineal or direct
penile trauma, results in uncontrolled high arterial inflow within the corpora
cavernosa. Non-ischemic priapism is typically painless and the penis only
semi-erect (149). Patients with arterial priapism typically seek medical
attention later than those with ischemic priapism, due to the fact that non-
ischemic priapism causes less pain and discomfort (147, 148).

Non-ischemic priapism is not considered a medical emergency. In some series
men have lived for many years with the condition (150). In such cases men
obtain additional tumescence with sexual arousal. In the setting where
treatment is desired, conservative management (e.g. observation, ice packs,
etc) may allow the injured cavernous artery to seal off and restore normal
blood flow to the corporal bodies. Androgen blockade with ketoconazole or
Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone agonists have been reported as successful in
management of non-ischemic priapism, possibly by reducing spontaneous
erections and enabling healing of the fistula tract (151). In refractory
cases, super selective arteriography allows for the exact determination of the
site of injury and treatment through embolization (152). Surgical exploration
and ligation of the fistula tract may also be considered by experienced
surgeons. There is a risk of ED associated with aggressive treatment of high
flow priapism (especially with the use of permanent embolic agents) (153).

### Ischemic Priapism

Ischemic (formerly known as low-flow) priapism is much more common and is
characterized by inadequate venous outflow from the penis; this restricts
arterial inflow and creates an acidotic hypoxic environment leading to a
painful prolonged erection (147, 148). This more common type of priapism has
become a well-recognized clinical entity because of the widespread use of
intracavernous agents for erections. Ischemic priapism is also commonly
associated with blood dyscrasias (e.g. Sickle Cell Disease, thalassemia,
leukemia), advanced pelvic malignancies, and medications such as trazodone
(154, 155).

Ischemic priapism is a serious medical condition and can lead to permanent
penile fibrosis and ED. When effectively treated early (within 6-12 hours of
onset) little risk of permanent injury exists. Tissue injury is visible after
12 hours of ischemia, characterized as interstitial edema. Within 24 hours,
there is destruction of the sinusoidal endothelium and adherence (147, 148,
155). All men using vasoactive drugs for penile self-injection should be
instructed to seek medical attention if they experience an erection persisting
longer than 3-4 hours.

The agent of choice for the treatment of ischemic priapism is phenylephrine at
a dosage of 100-250 ug, injected into the cavernous body each 2 minutes until
the penis is no longer rigid (147, 148, 156). At this concentration, little
impact on the systemic BP is seen in most men although blood pressure and
heart rate should be monitored. Detumescence is often within 2-5 minutes and
will first be noted with return of the arterial pulsations of the penis. In
some cases, aspiration of blood of the fully rigid penis may be needed to
attain detumescence. Once the rigidity is decreased, a more effective delivery
of the alpha-agonist is possible. Cases refractory to conservative management
(typically those of longer duration) may require surgical shunting procedures
to return the penis to a flaccid state (157, 158).

Although exchange transfusion and oxygenation is recommended by some for
management of sickle cell related ischemic priapism (159), definitive
management by phenylephrine irrigation with or without aspiration should not
be delayed (160).

The long-term sequelae of ischemic priapism may include penile scarring and
fibrosis, penile deformity and ED. Strategies to avoid these complications
include education in men using erectogenic agents and rapid treatment of
priapism as it occurs. Some highly reliable patients with recurrent priapism
related to Sickle Cell or other blood dyscrasia can be instructed on self-
administration of phenylephrine.

## CONCLUSIONS

As our understanding of the basic mechanisms of erectile function continues to
grow, new and improved therapies for the management of ED will continue to
emerge. We have witnessed a dramatic change in the treatment of men with
erectile dysfunction over the past 30 years. Treatment options have progressed
from psychosexual therapy and penile prostheses in the 1970s, through arterial
revascularization, vacuum constriction devices, and intracavernous injection
therapy in the 1980s, to transurethral and oral drug therapy in the 1990s and
the new millennium. Future interventions in development for ED include new and
improved drug therapy. Attention and interest has also been directed to gene
and stem cell therapy for this condition. Regardless of modality utilized,
restoration of erectile capacity and facilitation of satisfying sexuality will
remain an important goal for men and their sexual partners in the future.
