By Stephen Dinan - The Washington Times - Tuesday, June 10, 2014

Less than half of immigrants speak English very well and about 13 percent
don't speak it at all, according to new numbers the U.S. Census Bureau
released Tuesday.

Immigrants who have been here for more than three decades, however, do better
-- 63 percent report having English-speaking abilities and just 6 percent
don't speak English at all.

"In general, people who migrated to the United States a long time ago speak
English better today than those who migrated recently, and those with more
education have higher English-speaking ability than those with less
education," said demographer Christine Gambino, who was one of the authors of
the new Census report.

* * *

**SPECIAL COVERAGE: Immigration Reform**

* * *

The report also found that immigrants are less likely to speak English at home
now than they were in 1980. Then, about 70 percent of them spoke another
language at home. The rate is now 85 percent.

The new numbers come from the 2012 American Community Survey, which asks
respondents whether they speak only English at home, or speak another
language. If they spoke another language at home they are asked whether they
speak English "very well," "well," "not well," or "not at all."

* * *

* * *

The census says there are 40.6 million immigrants aged five and older in the
U.S.

Mexicans, who are the most numerous and account for more than a quarter of
those immigrants, rank particularly low -- 29 percent say they don't speak
English well, and another 18 percent say they don't speak it at all.

Guatemalans, who number about 852,000, rank lowest, with 31 percent saying
they don't speak English well and 18 percent saying they don't speak it at
all.

Unsurprisingly, education is a major predictor of English skills. About three-
quarters of all immigrants who have a bachelor's degree or higher speak
English very well. Just 19 percent of those with less than high school
education do so.

![Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is a family of single-seat, single-engine,

all-weather stealth multirole fighters. The fifth-generation combat aircraft

is designed to perform ground-attack and air-superiority missions. It has

three main models: the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing \(CTOL\)

variant, the F-35B short take-off and vertical-landing \(STOVL\) variant, and

the F-35C carrier-based catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery

\(CATOBAR\) variant. The F-35 descends from the Lockheed Martin X-35, the

winning design of the Joint Strike Fighter \(JSF\) program. It is built by

Lockheed and many subcontractors, including Northrop Grumman, Pratt &

Whitney, and BAE Systems. The United States plans to buy 2,663 F-35s, which

will provide the bulk of the crewed tactical airpower of the U.S. Air Force,

Navy, and Marine Corps in coming decades. Deliveries of the F-35 for the U.S.

military are scheduled until 2037 with a projected service life up to

2070](https://twt-
