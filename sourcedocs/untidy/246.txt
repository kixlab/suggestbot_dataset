Stages of Fetal Development - First Trimester

_**One - 13 Weeks**_

**FERTILIZATION**  
_(2 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period)_

Biologically speaking, fertilization (or conception) is the beginning of human
development. Fertilization normally occurs within several hours of ovulation
(some authors report up to 24 hours) when a man's sperm combines with a
woman's egg  
inside a woman's uterine tube.

                                      * Implantation begins the first week and the embryo continues to grow. The embryo is about 1/100 of an inch long at this time.

                      * Structures that will become arms and legs, called limb buds, begin to appear.
                      * The brain develops into five areas and some cranial nerves are visible.
                      * The eyes and ear begin to form.
                      * Tissue forms that develops into the vertebra and some other bones.
                      * The heart continues to develop and now beats at a regular rhythm.
                      * Rudimentary blood moves through the main vessels.

                      * The brain continues to form.
                      * The lungs begin to form.
                      * Fingers and toes begin to form, and arms and legs have grown longer.
                      * Feet and hands can be distinguished and now have fingers and toes (digits), which may still be webbed.
                      * The shell-shaped parts of the baby's ears are forming, and the baby's eyes are visible. The upper lip and nose have formed.
                      * The trunk of the baby's body is beginning to straighten.

                      * The beginnings of all key body parts are present, although they are not completely positioned in their final locations.

                      * The fetus can swallow, the kidneys make urine, and blood begins to form in the bone marrow.
                      * For females, ovarian follicles begin forming. For males, the prostate appears. A doctor may be able to identify the sex through special tests.
