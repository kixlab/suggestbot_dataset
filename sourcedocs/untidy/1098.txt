# Marijuana Possession: Laws & Penalties

## Get information on the laws and penalties for possession of marijuana, as

well as links to the law in your state.

By Stephen Stine, Attorney

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana is the most
commonly used illegal drug in America (marijuana is "illegal" in the sense
that it is a controlled substance under federal law, with no recognized
legitimate value). Despite the federal classification, some states have passed
medical marijuana laws permitting possession under certain circumstances; and
some state laws have decriminalized marijuana, making possession of small
amounts punishable by fines or treated as infractions, rather than as crimes
that carry potential jail sentences.

But in all states, it is still a violation of federal law to possess
marijuana. This conflict may someday be resolved by federal legislation that
allows for specified, legal uses, but for now, federal and state law are often
at odds with each other, as discussed below.

To get information in your state regarding marijuana laws, jump ahead to the
section on marijuana laws by state.

## Primary Factors Affecting Punishment

If you have been arrested for possession of marijuana, the key factors that
will affect the outcome of your case are as follows:

**State or federal jurisdiction.** Were you arrested by federal or state law
enforcement officials? If you were arrested for possession by state law
enforcement, you will need to review your state's laws. If you were arrested
by federal law enforcement, most likely you were targeted for arrest because
your possession was in connection with other violations such as drug
trafficking, large scale grow operations, ties to criminal enterprises, or
violent activities or unlawful possession of firearms. Under federal law,
possession by itself is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison
and up to $1,000 fine for a first offense. When possession is tied with sale
or other criminal enterprises, federal penalties are much harsher and
categorized as felonies. Federal prosecutors may also prosecute as marijuana
crimes conduct that is legal under a state's law. This is not common, but the
rise in medical marijuana laws has prompted the federal government to
periodically reevaluate its enforcement policies.

**Legalization.** In five states -- Alaska, Colorado, Washington D.C., Oregon,
and Washington -- possession by adults of small amounts for personal use is
completely legal under state law.

**Decriminalization.** Other states have classified possession of small
amounts as an infraction, including California, Connecticut, Maine,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North
Carolina, and Ohio. An infraction is a minor violation akin to a traffic
ticket; typically, violators are subject only to a small fine and first time
offenders usually have no criminal record. In states that have decriminalized
marijuana, offenders receive citations but they are not arrested unless they
possess large amounts or are repeat offenders.

State laws on marijuana change frequently. For more information, see the
decriminalization page on NORML, the organization that advocates for marijuana
reform.

**How much?** Punishment for marijuana possession typically varies according
to the quantity of marijuana possessed. Possession of marijuana almost always
constitutes a felony rather than a misdemeanor when the quantity is large
enough to indicate that it is held for sale rather than for personal use. In
almost all states, possession of amounts greater than one kilogram can result
in felony offenses, which carry a much more significant penalty. These felony
charges can also include the growing, cultivation, manufacturing or sale of
marijuana or marijuana drug paraphernalia.

**Medical marijuana**. A surprising number of states have allowed for
possession and use of specified quantities of marijuana, or its derivatives.
Some states' programs are not yet operational; other states (Texas and
Louisiana) require a physician to prescribe marijuana, which is not legal
under federal law. For a complete listing of medical marijuana states, see the
chart on the NORML medical marijuana page.

## Other Factors Enhancing Punishment

Certain additional factors may affect the punishment for possession. These
include:

  * Do you have a previous criminal record or is this a second or third offense for possession?
  * Did you sell or give marijuana to minors, or were you arrested for possession near a school, public park or similar community locale? In some states, this may results in enhanced punishment.
  * Was the arrest made in connection with a driving infraction? Many states have DUID (driving under the influence of drugs) laws that include marijuana. See Driving Under the Influence of Marijuana for more information.
  * Was the possession for plants or harvested marijuana? State laws may differ as to punishment regarding possession of plants versus possession of cut marijuana.
  * Did you have drug paraphernalia? State laws differ as to the legality of drug paraphernalia such as pipes, scales, bongs, or other devices.

## Marijuana Possession Penalties

For those charged with personal possession of marijuana (not for resale or
distribution), where decriminalization does not apply, a misdemeanor
possession charge will be lowest for first offenders. In situations where the
charge is based on sales of drug paraphernalia, the penalties can be increased
to a felony. Depending on the factors listed above, the penalties for
possession can include:

  * a fine (typically up to $2,000)
  * jail time (typically less than one year in jail)
  * mandatory drug testing
  * drug awareness classes
  * probation, and
  * electronic monitoring.

## Marijuana Possession Sentencing

Although possession of marijuana is typically not considered as serious as
possessing other types of drugs or controlled substances, judges have
sometimes imposed fairly stiff sentences even on first time offenders. As
noted, the individual's age, prior convictions and overall standing in the
community are typically taken into consideration. For those that have a
driver's license, suspension of the license can also occur and may be ordered
by judges. An attorney can assist in minimizing the sentence by working with
the prosecuting attorney to plea bargain or agree to a treatment program
rather than a conviction.
