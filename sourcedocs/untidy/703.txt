>> An example of a temperature anomaly is how much warmer or colder than the
long-term average a unit of time something is (like how much warmer than
average the most recent year was globally).

>> This graph illustrates the change in global surface temperature relative to
1951-1980 average temperatures. Eighteen of the 19 warmest years all have
occurred since 2001, with the exception of 1998. The year 2016 ranks as the
warmest on record. (Source: NASA/GISS). This research is broadly consistent
with similar constructions prepared by the Climatic Research Unit and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

>>

>> The time series below shows the five-year average variation of global
surface temperatures. Dark blue indicates areas cooler than average. Dark red
indicates areas warmer than average.
