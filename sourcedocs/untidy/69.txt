prosimians. Many of them may be familiar, but it would not be surprising if
you cannot immediately visualize prosimians (like the ring-tailed lemurs in
the picture on the right).

> How many living primate species exist today is not clear. The number varies
depending on whether closely related groups are considered to be varieties of
each other or distinct species. Some taxonomic splitters classify up to 350
species, while lumpers include as few as 190. Most estimates are in the range
of 230-270. This ambiguity may be partly resolved in the future with DNA
sequencing data. Compounding the problem is the fact that every few years new
species of primates are found. The tropical forests of South America, Africa,
and Southeast Asia may still be hiding ones that are unknown to the scientific
world. However, it is likely that all major groupings of primates have been
discovered.

>

> Many primate species are now in danger of becoming extinct. The primary
cause is deforestation, driven ultimately by human population growth.
Additional pressure is placed on primate populations by humans hunting them to
sell for food and pets. Monkeys and apes are popular sources of "bush meat" in
West Africa. At least 22 species of primates and many other kinds of wild
animals are being hunted in Africa for this purpose. Despite the fact that the
sale of "bush meat" is outlawed in most countries, it is now being sold
illegally in Europe and North America. In recent years, it could be bought at
stores that cater to African immigrants in Paris, New York, Chicago, San
Francisco, Montreal, and some other major cities.

> Today, non-human primates are limited in their natural habitats primarily to
the tropical and subtropical regions of the New and Old Worlds. They have
never lived in Australia and most of the islands in the Pacific ocean.
However, the earliest primates also lived in North America and Europe
beginning around 55-50 million years ago.

> Primates are surprisingly variable in size. They range all the way from the
pygmy mouse lemur that weighs less than 2 ounces (55 g.) and can fit in the
palm of your hand to the gorilla that grows to as much as 440 pounds (200 kg.)
in the wild and even heavier in captivity. Still larger primates existed in
the past but are now extinct.

>

> Primates are generally lively, clever, and very successful at adapting to
different environmental opportunities. Physically, however, they are
relatively unspecialized compared to animals such as birds, horses, and cats.
Primates are not particularly fast runners, they do not have the sharpest
hearing, they cannot fly, nor are they efficient hunters.

> With the exception of spider monkeys, all of the primates have retained the
ancient mammalian trait of **pentadactylism** ![click this icon to hear the

preceding term pronounced](images/horn.gif) , which is having five fingers on
each hand and five toes on each foot. An increasing refinement of the hands
and feet for grasping objects has been a hallmark of primate evolution. Their
fingers and toes are mobile and have very sensitive tactile pads at the tips,
unlike most other mammals. At least some digits on all primates also have flat
nails in place of rigid claws. This makes the manipulation of bits of food and
other objects much easier.

>

> The grasping, or **prehensile** ![click this icon to hear the preceding term

pronounced](images/horn.gif) , ability of primate hands varies significantly
also with the degree of opposability of the thumb. Partially rotating the
thumb and pressing it forcefully towards the fingers provides a secure grip
for hanging on branches and for manipulating small objects. All primates, with
the exception of humans, have prehensile feet in addition to hands. However,
few have the high degree of thumb opposability and strength typical of humans.

>

> The small New World monkeys called marmosets and tamarins usually hang onto
a tree branch by pressing against it with their palms and using all of their
bent fingers together as counter pressure in a hook-like **power grip**. The
more dexterous monkeys and apes can also use a secure power grip formed by the
partial flexion of the fingers and the palm with counter force applied by the
thumb. Humans and some apes also can employ **precision grips** formed by
pinching with the tips of their flexed forefingers and the thumb. This allows
their hands to be used effectively for manipulating small objects, such as the
fork in the hand of the chimpanzee shown below.

> All primates have a marked tendency towards erectness in their upper bodies.
This can be seen in their sitting and standing postures as well as occasional
bipedalism ![click this icon to hear the preceding term

pronounced](images/horn.gif). They also have shoulder joints that are
unusually flexible for mammals. This is due to secure ball joints and strong
**clavicles** ![click this icon to hear the preceding term

pronounced](images/horn.gif) , or collarbones, which have allowed them to use
their arms very effectively in climbing trees. Clavicles are another ancient
mammalian trait that primates have retained.

>

> In primate evolution, there was a progressive reduction in nose size and in
the olfactory ![click this icon to hear the preceding term

pronounced](images/horn.gif) areas of the brain. Lemurs are an exception. They
are very much like the early primates 50 million years ago. Note the marked
difference between lemur, monkey, and human noses in the photos below. Most
monkeys and apes have evolved relatively small noses like us, while lemurs
have retained long snouts similar to foxes and raccoons. It is not surprising
that lemurs have a comparatively good sense of smell.

> Most mammals have about the same number of genes that code for odor
receptors in their nasal tracks. However, the majority of these genes in
humans, and presumably other large primates, are no longer functional. Recent
research has shown that of the approximately 1,000 human olfactory receptor
genes, only 347 remain functional. The rest have mutations that deactivate
them. Does this really mean that people have a poor sense of smell? The answer
is both yes and no. We are poor at sensing short-chain chemical compounds but
good at discriminating between complex long-chain ones such as those of many
foods and flowers. Dogs are just the opposite in this. However, the smelling
ability of dogs is far superior to people in one way. Fewer molecules of a
substance are usually needed for dogs to detect it.

>

> As the primate nose progressively shrank in size over millions of years,
there was a corresponding increase in visual capabilities. As much as 50% of
the cerebral cortex in some species of monkeys is involved in visual
processing. Many primates have color vision comparable to our own. All have
binocular vision with fields of view that significantly overlap, resulting in
true **three dimensional (3-D) depth perception** or **stereoscopic vision**.
At the same time, the field of view for peripheral vision was reduced.

> Depth perception is an invaluable tool for animals that need to move
quickly. It allows them to judge the distances to important objects in their
environment. For monkeys jumping from branch to branch high up in the canopies
of forests, this is a matter of life and death. Likewise, accurate depth
perception is a critical capability for hunters, such as cats and hawks, who
need to accurately judge distances in the pursuit of their prey. In contrast,
it is often preferable to have greater peripheral vision if you are the prey.
Gazelles, rabbits, and chickens have nearly a 360 field of view, but
relatively little of that is stereoscopic vision.

>

> Compared to most other animals, primate brains are large relative to their
body size. Those areas of the brain that are involved with controlling manual
dexterity, eye-hand coordination, and stereoscopic vision have particularly
expanded. These traits were probably selected by nature mostly due to their
usefulness in traveling in trees, manipulating objects, and getting food.

> The more capable uterus and placenta of primates support long **gestation**
periods , or pregnancies, for animals of their size. For example, the mouse
lemur has a gestation period of 60 days, but it is only 20 days for a
comparable size rodent mouse. Macaques, which are one of the most common
groups of monkey species in the Old World, have 13.5-15.5 week gestations.
Among comparable size domesticated dogs, it is only about 9 weeks. The result
of long gestations is that offspring are born more mature and, therefore, have
a greater chance of survival. Primate mothers also are generally very
protective and nurturing with their young. Subsequently, primates do not need
to have many offspring to maintain their population numbers. Multiple births
at any one time are rare for them. The time gap between generations is
surprisingly long for the larger primates. Among humans today, parents are on
average 29 years older than their children. By comparison, chimpanzee mothers
are on average 25 years older than their offspring. Among female gorillas, it
is 19.3 years.

>

> There frequently is a correlation between body size and longevity in the
animal kingdom. Species with larger bodies generally live longer. However,
primates have unusually long natural life spans for their size. For instance,
mouse lemurs live about 8 years. Rodent mice rarely reach 2 years. Rats, which
are slightly larger than mouse lemurs, can live 3 years. Big monkeys, such as
baboons, live up to 30 years. Male baboons can weigh as much as 90 pounds.
Comparable size domesticated dogs have a life expectancy of only 10-12 years.
With good medical care, chimpanzees can live nearly as long as people (50-75+
years). This is not surprising given that they are anatomically very similar
to us. Research done by Herman Pontzer of Hunter College suggests that the
unusual longevity of primates is due to the fact that they expend only 50% as
many calories a day compared to other animals their size. Slower metabolism
rates are associated with slower rates of growth, reproduction, and aging in
mammals.

>

> Most primates have adapted to an **arboreal** , or tree living, way of life.
Even the terrestrial ![click this icon to hear the preceding term

pronounced](images/horn.gif) ones usually sleep in the trees. The most notable
exceptions are humans and gorillas. Both of these species live on the ground
with occasional tree climbing for fun, especially by children. Almost all
primates are **diurnal** , which is to say, they are active during the day and
sleep at night.

>

> Generally, primates are highly social animals. Most of their waking hours
are spent socializing with each other. This is made easier by complex
vocalizations and visual displays. In addition, they regularly groom each
other, thereby keeping clean and satisfying psychological needs at the same
time. **Grooming** is a very pleasurable activity for primates, including
humans. It is important to note that the few nocturnal ![click this icon to

hear the preceding term pronounced](images/horn.gif) primate species are the
least social.

> Primates have been very successful animals due largely to the fact that they
are intelligent and opportunistic in getting food. Most are unusually
adaptable in diet. This has tremendous evolutionarily selective value. Many
species are omnivorous ![click this icon to hear the preceding term

pronounced](images/horn.gif), though vegetable foods usually make up the bulk
of calories consumed by most primate species because they are easier to
obtain. By comparison, animals such as koalas and giant pandas are generally
less successful because they are extremely limited in the kinds of foods that
they can or will eat. Koalas subsist on the leaves of a few species of
eucalyptus, and giant pandas primarily eat the shoots of a small number of
bamboo species. If these food sources are not available, koalas and giant
pandas die. Not surprisingly, their highly limited range of foods restricts
where they can live. This is not the case with many primate species.

>

> **Are Primates Good** **Pets?**

>

> Often people who have not had the responsibility of taking care of a monkey
or ape in captivity think that they would be great pets. After all, they are
cute when they are youngsters and remarkably human-like. However, they
generally make very poor pets. As one monkey owner said "People find out when
it's too late. After six months, they're like a two year-old that can fly."
Because they are intelligent, very active, sometimes unpredictable, and easily
bored, they frequently get into trouble when left alone. In addition to being
destructive, most are as messy as human babies. Unlike humans, however, they
remain this way all of their unusually long lives. Owning large apes in
particular is a lifelong commitment that takes considerable patience, energy,
and money. Male chimpanzees can be surprisingly violent in their interactions
with each other and humans. In recent years, several people have been
extensively maimed and even killed by their pet chimpanzees in the U.S.
