# Rising Global Temperatures and CO2

__

  * **Published:** November 20th, 2018

_By Climate Central_

In 1895, Svante Arrhenius first calculated the impact that increasing carbon
dioxide could have on Earth's temperature. Since then, scientists have further
refined their understanding of the greenhouse effect and the role our rising
carbon emissions are having on it.

Chief among the impacts of our emissions is the rise in the global
temperature. That's why countries around the world have agreed to limitthat
warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures.
