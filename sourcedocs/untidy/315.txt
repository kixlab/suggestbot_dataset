**ORLANDO, Fla.** -- Kissing cousins aren't doing their children any
evolutionary favors, some preliminary data suggest.

Mating with a close relative, known as inbreeding, reduces nonhuman animals'
evolutionary fitness -- measured by the ability to produce offspring.
Inbreeding, it turns out, also puts a hit on humans' reproductive success,
David Clark of the University of Edinburgh reported October 20 at the annual
meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics.

Offspring of second cousins or closer relatives make up about 10 percent of
the world population, Clark said. He and colleagues collected data on more
than a million people from more than 100 culturally diverse populations and
calculated the effect inbreeding has on traits related to evolutionary
fitness.
