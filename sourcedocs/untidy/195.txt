Lesson Transcript

Instructor: _Dustin Parrett_

In this lesson we examine the judicial branch of the government, including the
Supreme Court and its power of judicial review. You will learn how the Supreme
Court can rule laws unconstitutional.

## Definition of the Judicial Branch

The **judicial branch** is one of three branches of the federal government.
The judicial branch includes criminal and civil courts and helps interpret the
United States Constitution.

If the federal government were like a basketball game, the judicial branch is
much like the referee that helps settle disputes. The executive branch and the
legislative branch are often like the players in the game trying to score
points against each other, and the judicial branch is there to clarify the
rules and make sure each side is acting fairly.

The judicial branch is able to do this through its special power known as
judicial review and as part of the process of checks and balances between the
three branches of government.

## The Courts and the Supreme Court

The main body of the judicial branch is the **Supreme Court**. It is the top
court in the United States, and no other court can challenge it. The main job
of the Supreme Court is to interpret the Constitution. Like being a referee
when two players cry foul, it is the Supreme Court's job to decide who is
correct.

There are nine justices who sit on the Supreme Court. The odd number of
justices is meant to reduce the chances of ties during cases, and thus for the
Supreme Court to decide a case, they simply need a majority of justices to
agree.

Being a justice on the Supreme Court is a prestigious and powerful position.
Not only is their job important, but once they are officially appointed and
confirmed, they serve for life. Supreme Court justices never have to run for
re-election or seek re-appointment. This gives them a lot of freedom to do the
job as they see fit without consequences.

In addition to the Supreme Court, the judicial branch is made up of lower
courts. These courts serve under the Supreme Court and help manage the
workload. There are simply too many cases in the court system for the Supreme
Court to hear them all, so these other courts help. The Supreme Court then
handles the most important cases.

## Checks and Balances

The three branches of the federal government each have the ability to keep the
others from getting too powerful. In other words, each branch helps balance
against the other branches by checking their powers.

The other branches of the government can check the judicial branch through the
nomination and appointment process. The actual people who make up the judicial
branch, the judges and justices, must be nominated by the executive branch and
approved by the legislative branch. This gives the other branches of
government an important say in what kind of people will work for the judicial
branch. This is a very important process, especially since these justices
serve for life.

Additionally, under extreme circumstances, the legislative branch may remove
members of the judicial branch through a process known as impeachment. While
this has only occurred rarely, and has never occurred with a Supreme Court
justice, it still represents the ability of the legislative branch to balance
against the powers of the judicial branch.

The judicial branch has a very important power it may use to keep the other
two branches in line. This power is called **judicial review**.

## Judicial Review

When the United States was just getting started as a country, the role of the
judicial branch was uncertain. It wasn't until a dispute between a president
and his predecessor reached the Supreme Court that the judicial branch's role
became defined. This case, **_Marbury v. Madison_** , held that the Supreme
Court's role was to settle questions about the interpretation of the
Constitution.

This is called **judicial review**. Judicial review means that the judicial
branch has the power to review legislation passed by the legislative branch or
policies enacted by the executive branch.

The way judicial review works is that the judicial branch interprets the
Constitution to determine if the Constitution allows these laws and policies.
Simply, the judicial branch determines whether the Constitution allows certain
laws to be passed. If the Supreme Court decides that a law passed by Congress
is not allowable, then the law is considered unconstitutional and is erased.

This gives the Supreme Court a tremendous amount of power. Imagine a law that
everyone wants, Congress passes, and the president signs, only to have the
Supreme Court determine it to be invalid and erase the whole thing.

## Lesson Summary

The judicial branch is one of three branches of the federal branch. The
judicial branch includes criminal and civil courts and helps interpret the
United States Constitution. As we learned, the most important part of the
judicial branch is the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's role is to interpret
the Constitution and limit the powers of the other branches of government. The
Supreme Court's power to do this is its power of judicial review, where it
determines which laws and policies are constitutional, or allowable, and which
are not.

## Learning Outcomes

        * Explain what the judicial branch is 
    * Identify the components of the judicial branch
