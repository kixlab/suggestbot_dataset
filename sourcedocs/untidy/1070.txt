Daily use of marijuana as well as past month rates rose for both men and women
aged 26 and older in states with medical marijuana laws in effect, according
to researchers at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.
Marijuana use among those younger than 26 years old was generally unaffected
by changes in the law. The results of the study are published online in
_Prevention Science_.

In states with medical marijuana laws, daily marijuana use for male users age
26 and older increased from 16.3 percent to 19.1 percent, and for women, from
9.2 percent to 12.7 percent. Past month use among men in the same age bracket
increased from 7.0 percent before the laws passed to 8.7 percent following
their passage, and for women rose from 3.0 percent before to 4.3 percent
after. There were no significant increases in past-year marijuana use disorder
(continuing to use despite significant behavioral or psychological changes)
for any age or gender group following passage of the laws.

The study also documents a rise in males ages 18-25 using marijuana daily
compared to females. "Among past month users, more than one in five young men
ages 18-25 living in states with medical marijuana laws said they used
marijuana every day," said Christine Mauro, PhD, assistant professor of
Biostatistics at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, and first author.

Daily use was generally higher among individuals aged 18-25 compared with
those ages 12-17 and those 26 or older, regardless of their state's laws
around marijuana. "Daily marijuana use raises health concerns as the brain
doesn't fully mature until age 25," noted Mauro.

The researchers analyzed state-level survey data from the National Survey on
Drug Use and Health for the years 2004-2013, including more than 17,500 youth
(12-17 years-old), 17,500 young adults (18-25 years-old), and 18,800 adults 26
and older per year studied.

Since 1996, more than half of the United States has passed medical marijuana
laws, with 28 states legalizing medical marijuana use as of November 2016;
eight states have legalized recreational marijuana. "As more states enact laws
and more years of data are available, future research should examine how
legalization of recreational marijuana and other local rules contribute to
changes in marijuana use," said Mauro.

Rising rates of marijuana use raises concerns regarding associated increases
in heavy use of marijuana and marijuana use disorder. Earlier research by
Columbia researchers estimated that 16.2 percent and 57.2 percent of daily
marijuana users meet criteria for DSM-IV abuse and dependence diagnosis,
respectively.

"The advent of medical marijuana laws has been proposed as one potential cause
of the increased prevalence of marijuana use, but there is now a general
consensus that passage of the laws has not affected rates of use in
adolescents," said Silvia Martins, MD, PHD, associate professor of
Epidemiology at the Mailman School, and senior author. Until this most recent
data, studies by Martins and colleagues found past-year individual use rose
among all adults 26+ in states with medical marijuana laws but had not
investigated changes in daily marijuana use and marijuana use disorder.

In fact, despite public health concerns regarding increased use of pot and
enactment of marijuana laws, some positive outcomes have been associated with
the laws, including decreased opioid use and decreased alcohol consumption --
the latter tied to declining rates of traffic injury fatalities at the state
level. "Research shows the impacts of medical marijuana law, both positive and
negative," noted Martins.

"Because most states in our sample more recently passed medical marijuana
laws, it is possible that not enough time has elapsed to observe more
significant changes in marijuana use disorder across age-gender subgroups,"
said Mauro. "Given the impact the disorder may have on individuals, families
and society, marijuana use should continue to be monitored regularly. Building
the evidence base by age and gender is critical in helping public health
professionals better understand which groups, may be most affected by medical
marijuana laws and target public health programming accordingly."
