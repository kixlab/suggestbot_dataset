![U.S. vehicle registrations

1990-2017](https://cdn.statcdn.com/Statistic/180000/183505-blank-100.png) This
graph shows the number of vehicles in the U.S. from 1990 through 2017. Some
272.48 million vehicles were registered here in 2017. The figures include
passenger cars, motorcycles, trucks, buses, and other vehicles. The number of
cars sold in the U.S. per year stood at 6.3 million in 2016.  
**U.S. vehicle registrations**

Second only to China, the United States is one of the world’s largest
automobile markets based on the number of new light vehicle registrations,
with around 17.55 million new light vehicle registrations in 2016. However, of
the 68.6 million passenger cars produced worldwide in 2016, less than four
million automobiles were produced in the U.S.

While the United States imports a significant amount of vehicles from various
countries such as Japan, Mexico and Canada, passenger car assembly within the
country increased from some 2.2 million units produced in 2009 to a little
under four million units in 2016. Toyota and BMW are the leading carmakers
selling imported cars in the United States.

The leading car manufacturers overall in the United States include the Detroit
Big Three automakers: General Motors, Ford and Chrysler; today, Chrysler is
fully owned by Fiat though. With respect to car brands, the Ford brand clocked
in at number one in 2016, selling around 2.5 million vehicles in the United
States alone. The brand's holding company is the Ford Motor Company; it was
founded by Henry Ford in 1903 in Dearborn, Michigan. The company pioneered in
large-scale car manufacturing and introduced production methods such as the
assembly line. Ford is one of the world’s largest automobile manufacturers,
with 2016 revenue of just under 152 billion U.S. dollars.
