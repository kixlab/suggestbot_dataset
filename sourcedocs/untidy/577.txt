_Homo sapiens_

**Human evolution** is the evolutionary process that led to the emergence of
anatomically modern humans, beginning with the evolutionary history of
primates—in particular genus _Homo_ —and leading to the emergence of _Homo
sapiens_ as a distinct species of the hominid family, the great apes. This
process involved the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism
and language,[1] as well as interbreeding with other hominins, which indicate
that human evolution was not linear but a web.[2][3][4][5]

The study of human evolution involves several scientific disciplines,
including physical anthropology, primatology, archaeology, paleontology,
neurobiology, ethology, linguistics, evolutionary psychology, embryology and
genetics.[6] Genetic studies show that primates diverged from other mammals
about 85 million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous period, and the earliest
fossils appear in the Paleocene, around 55 million years ago.[7]

Within the Hominoidea (apes) superfamily, the Hominidae family diverged from
the Hylobatidae (gibbon) family some 15–20 million years ago; African great
apes (subfamily Homininae) diverged from orangutans (Ponginae) about 14
million years ago; the Hominini tribe (humans, _Australopithecines_ and other
extinct biped genera, and chimpanzee) parted from the Gorillini tribe
(gorillas) between 8–9 million years ago; and, in turn, the subtribes Hominina
(humans and biped ancestors) and Panina (chimps) separated 4–7.5 million years
ago.[8]

## Anatomical changes[edit]

The hominoids are descendants of a common ancestor

Human evolution from its first separation from the last common ancestor of
humans and chimpanzees is characterized by a number of morphological,
developmental, physiological, and behavioral changes. The most significant of
these adaptations are bipedalism, increased brain size, lengthened ontogeny
(gestation and infancy), and decreased sexual dimorphism. The relationship
between these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.[9][ _page needed_ ]
Other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a power and
precision grip, a change first occurring in _H. erectus_.[10]

### Bipedalism[edit]

Bipedalism is the basic adaptation of the hominid and is considered the main
cause behind a suite of skeletal changes shared by all bipedal hominids. The
earliest hominin, of presumably primitive bipedalism, is considered to be
either _Sahelanthropus_ [11] or _Orrorin_ , both of which arose some 6 to 7
million years ago. The non-bipedal knuckle-walkers, the gorilla and
chimpanzee, diverged from the hominin line over a period covering the same
time, so either of _Sahelanthropus_ or _Orrorin_ may be our last shared
ancestor. _Ardipithecus_ , a full biped, arose approximately 5.6 million years
ago.[12]

The early bipeds eventually evolved into the australopithecines and still
later into the genus _Homo_. There are several theories of the adaptation
value of bipedalism. It is possible that bipedalism was favored because it
freed the hands for reaching and carrying food, saved energy during
locomotion,[13] enabled long distance running and hunting, provided an
enhanced field of vision, and helped avoid hyperthermia by reducing the
surface area exposed to direct sun; features all advantageous for thriving in
the new savanna and woodland environment created as a result of the East
African Rift Valley uplift versus the previous closed forest
habitat.[14][13][15] A new study provides support for the hypothesis that
walking on two legs, or bipedalism, evolved because it used less energy than
quadrupedal knuckle-walking.[16][17] However, recent studies suggest that
bipedality without the ability to use fire would not have allowed global
dispersal.[18] This change in gait saw a lengthening of the legs
proportionately when compared to the length of the arms, which were shortened
through the removal of the need for brachiation. Another change is the shape
of the big toe. Recent studies suggest that Australopithecines still lived
part of the time in trees as a result of maintaining a grasping big toe. This
was progressively lost in Habilines.

Anatomically, the evolution of bipedalism has been accompanied by a large
number of skeletal changes, not just to the legs and pelvis, but also to the
vertebral column, feet and ankles, and skull.[19] The femur evolved into a
slightly more angular position to move the center of gravity toward the
geometric center of the body. The knee and ankle joints became increasingly
robust to better support increased weight. To support the increased weight on
each vertebra in the upright position, the human vertebral column became
S-shaped and the lumbar vertebrae became shorter and wider. In the feet the
big toe moved into alignment with the other toes to help in forward
locomotion. The arms and forearms shortened relative to the legs making it
easier to run. The foramen magnum migrated under the skull and more
anterior.[20]

The most significant changes occurred in the pelvic region, where the long
downward facing iliac blade was shortened and widened as a requirement for
keeping the center of gravity stable while walking;[21] bipedal hominids have
a shorter but broader, bowl-like pelvis due to this. A drawback is that the
birth canal of bipedal apes is smaller than in knuckle-walking apes, though
there has been a widening of it in comparison to that of australopithecine and
modern humans, permitting the passage of newborns due to the increase in
cranial size but this is limited to the upper portion, since further increase
can hinder normal bipedal movement.[22]

The shortening of the pelvis and smaller birth canal evolved as a requirement
for bipedalism and had significant effects on the process of human birth which
is much more difficult in modern humans than in other primates. During human
birth, because of the variation in size of the pelvic region, the fetal head
must be in a transverse position (compared to the mother) during entry into
the birth canal and rotate about 90 degrees upon exit.[23] The smaller birth
canal became a limiting factor to brain size increases in early humans and
prompted a shorter gestation period leading to the relative immaturity of
human offspring, who are unable to walk much before 12 months and have greater
neoteny, compared to other primates, who are mobile at a much earlier age.[15]
The increased brain growth after birth and the increased dependency of
children on mothers had a big effect upon the female reproductive cycle,[24]
and the more frequent appearance of alloparenting in humans when compared with
other hominids.[25] Delayed human sexual maturity also led to the evolution of
menopause with one explanation providing that elderly women could better pass
on their genes by taking care of their daughter's offspring, as compared to
having more children of their own.[26]

### Encephalization[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Brain_size_and_tooth_size_in_hominins.jpg/370px-

Brain_size_and_tooth_size_in_hominins.jpg)

Brain size and tooth size in hominins

The human species eventually developed a much larger brain than that of other
primates—typically 1,330 cm3 (81 cu in) in modern humans, nearly three times
the size of a chimpanzee or gorilla brain.[27] After a period of stasis with
_Australopithecus anamensis_ and _Ardipithecus_ , species which had smaller
brains as a result of their bipedal locomotion,[28] the pattern of
encephalization started with _Homo habilis_ , whose 600 cm3 (37 cu in) brain
was slightly larger than that of chimpanzees. This evolution continued in
_Homo erectus_ with 800–1,100 cm3 (49–67 cu in), and reached a maximum in
Neanderthals with 1,200–1,900 cm3 (73–116 cu in), larger even than modern
_Homo sapiens_. This brain increase manifested during postnatal brain growth,
far exceeding that of other apes (heterochrony). It also allowed for extended
periods of social learning and language acquisition in juvenile humans,
beginning as much as 2 million years ago.

Furthermore, the changes in the structure of human brains may be even more
significant than the increase in size.[29][30][31][32]

![Three students hold three different skulls in front of their faces, to show

the difference in size and shape compared to the modern

head](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Students_explore_hominid_evolution.jpg/220px-

Students_explore_hominid_evolution.jpg)

The size and shape of the skull changed over time. The leftmost, and largest,
is a replica of a modern human skull.

The temporal lobes, which contain centers for language processing, have
increased disproportionately, as has the prefrontal cortex, which has been
related to complex decision-making and moderating social behavior.[27]
Encephalization has been tied to increased meat and starches in the
diet,[33][34][35] and the development of cooking,[36] and it has been proposed
that intelligence increased as a response to an increased necessity for
solving social problems as human society became more complex.[37] Changes in
skull morphology, such as smaller mandibles and mandible muscle attachments,
allowed more room for the brain to grow.[38]

The increase in volume of the neocortex also included a rapid increase in size
of the cerebellum. Its function has traditionally been associated with balance
and fine motor control, but more recently with speech and cognition. The great
apes, including hominids, had a more pronounced cerebellum relative to the
neocortex than other primates. It has been suggested that because of its
function of sensory-motor control and learning complex muscular actions, the
cerebellum may have underpinned human technological adaptations, including the
preconditions of speech.[39][40][41][42]

The immediate survival advantage of encephalization is difficult to discern,
as the major brain changes from _Homo erectus_ to _Homo heidelbergensis_ were
not accompanied by major changes in technology. It has been suggested that the
changes were mainly social and behavioural, including increased empathic
abilities,[43][44] increases in size of social groups,[45][46][47] and
increased behavioural plasticity.[48] Encephalization may be due to a
dependency on calorie-dense, difficult-to-acquire food.[49]

### Sexual dimorphism[edit]

The reduced degree of sexual dimorphism in humans is visible primarily in the
reduction of the male canine tooth relative to other ape species (except
gibbons) and reduced brow ridges and general robustness of males. Another
important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the
evolution of hidden estrus. Humans are the only hominoids in which the female
is fertile year round and in which no special signals of fertility are
produced by the body (such as genital swelling or overt changes in
proceptivity during estrus).[50]

Nonetheless, humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution
of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around
15% larger than females.[51] These changes taken together have been
interpreted as a result of an increased emphasis on pair bonding as a possible
solution to the requirement for increased parental investment due to the
prolonged infancy of offspring.[52]

### Ulnar opposition[edit]

The ulnar opposition—the contact between the thumb and the tip of the little
finger of the same hand—is unique to the genus Homo,[53] including
Neanderthals, the Sima de los Huesos hominins and anatomically modern
humans.[54][55] In other primates the thumb is short and unable to touch the
little finger.[54] The ulnar opposition facilitates the precision grip and
power grip of the human hand, underlying all the skilled manipulations.

### Other changes[edit]

A number of other changes have also characterized the evolution of humans,
among them an increased importance on vision rather than smell; a longer
juvenile developmental period and higher infant dependency; a smaller gut;
faster basal metabolism;[56] loss of body hair; evolution of sweat glands; a
change in the shape of the dental arcade from being u-shaped to being
parabolic; development of a chin (found in _Homo sapiens_ alone); development
of styloid processes; and the development of a descended larynx.

### Before Darwin[edit]

The word _homo_ , the name of the biological genus to which humans belong, is
Latin for "human". It was chosen originally by Carl Linnaeus in his
classification system. The word "human" is from the Latin _humanus_ , the
adjectival form of _homo_. The Latin "homo" derives from the Indo-European
root * _dhghem_ , or "earth".[57] Linnaeus and other scientists of his time
also considered the great apes to be the closest relatives of humans based on
morphological and anatomical similarities.

### Darwin[edit]

The possibility of linking humans with earlier apes by descent became clear
only after 1859 with the publication of Charles Darwin's _On the Origin of
Species_ , in which he argued for the idea of the evolution of new species
from earlier ones. Darwin's book did not address the question of human
evolution, saying only that "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his
history."[58]

The first debates about the nature of human evolution arose between Thomas
Henry Huxley and Richard Owen. Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by
illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes,
and did so particularly in his 1863 book _Evidence as to Man's Place in
Nature_. However, many of Darwin's early supporters (such as Alfred Russel
Wallace and Charles Lyell) did not initially agree that the origin of the
mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by
natural selection, though this later changed. Darwin applied the theory of
evolution and sexual selection to humans when he published _The Descent of
Man_ in 1871.[59]

### First fossils[edit]

A major problem in the 19th century was the lack of fossil intermediaries.
Neanderthal remains were discovered in a limestone quarry in 1856, three years
before the publication of _On the Origin of Species_ , and Neanderthal fossils
had been discovered in Gibraltar even earlier, but it was originally claimed
that these were human remains of a creature suffering some kind of
illness.[60] Despite the 1891 discovery by Eugène Dubois of what is now called
_Homo erectus_ at Trinil, Java, it was only in the 1920s when such fossils
were discovered in Africa, that intermediate species began to accumulate. [
_citation needed_ ] In 1925, Raymond Dart described _Australopithecus
africanus_.[61] The type specimen was the Taung Child, an australopithecine
infant which was discovered in a cave. The child's remains were a remarkably
well-preserved tiny skull and an endocast of the brain.

Although the brain was small (410 cm3), its shape was rounded, unlike that of
chimpanzees and gorillas, and more like a modern human brain. Also, the
specimen showed short canine teeth, and the position of the foramen magnum
(the hole in the skull where the spine enters) was evidence of bipedal
locomotion. All of these traits convinced Dart that the Taung Child was a
bipedal human ancestor, a transitional form between apes and humans.

### The East African fossils[edit]

Fossil_hominids.jpg)

Oklahoma, U.S..

During the 1960s and 1970s, hundreds of fossils were found in East Africa in
the regions of the Olduvai Gorge and Lake Turkana. The driving force of these
searches was the Leakey family, with Louis Leakey and his wife Mary Leakey,
and later their son Richard and daughter-in-law Meave—all successful and
world-renowned fossil hunters and paleoanthropologists. From the fossil beds
of Olduvai and Lake Turkana they amassed specimens of the early hominins: the
australopithecines and _Homo_ species, and even _Homo erectus_.

These finds cemented Africa as the cradle of humankind. In the late 1970s and
the 1980s, Ethiopia emerged as the new hot spot of paleoanthropology after
"Lucy", the most complete fossil member of the species _Australopithecus
afarensis_ , was found in 1974 by Donald Johanson near Hadar in the desertic
Afar Triangle region of northern Ethiopia. Although the specimen had a small
brain, the pelvis and leg bones were almost identical in function to those of
modern humans, showing with certainty that these hominins had walked
erect.[62] Lucy was classified as a new species, _Australopithecus afarensis_
, which is thought to be more closely related to the genus _Homo_ as a direct
ancestor, or as a close relative of an unknown ancestor, than any other known
hominid or hominin from this early time range; _see_ terms "hominid" and
"hominin".[63] (The specimen was nicknamed "Lucy" after the Beatles' song
"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", which was played loudly and repeatedly in the
camp during the excavations.)[64] The Afar Triangle area would later yield
discovery of many more hominin fossils, particularly those uncovered or
described by teams headed by Tim D. White in the 1990s, including
_Ardipithecus ramidus_ and _Ardipithecus kadabba_.[65]

In 2013, fossil skeletons of _Homo naledi_ , an extinct species of hominin
assigned (provisionally) to the genus _Homo_ , were found in the Rising Star
Cave system, a site in South Africa's Cradle of Humankind region in Gauteng
province near Johannesburg.[66][67] As of September 2015[update], fossils of
at least fifteen individuals, amounting to 1,550 specimens, have been
excavated from the cave.[67] The species is characterized by a body mass and
stature similar to small-bodied human populations, a smaller endocranial
volume similar to _Australopithecus_ , and a cranial morphology (skull shape)
similar to early _Homo_ species. The skeletal anatomy combines primitive
features known from australopithecines with features known from early
hominins. The individuals show signs of having been deliberately disposed of
within the cave near the time of death. The fossils were dated close to
250,000 years ago,[68] and thus are not a direct ancestor but a contemporary
with the first appearance of larger-brained anatomically modern humans.[69]

### The genetic revolution[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Louis_Leakey.jpg/150px-

The genetic revolution in studies of human evolution started when Vincent
Sarich and Allan Wilson measured the strength of immunological cross-reactions
of blood serum albumin between pairs of creatures, including humans and
African apes (chimpanzees and gorillas).[70] The strength of the reaction
could be expressed numerically as an immunological distance, which was in turn
proportional to the number of amino acid differences between homologous
proteins in different species. By constructing a calibration curve of the ID
of species' pairs with known divergence times in the fossil record, the data
could be used as a molecular clock to estimate the times of divergence of
pairs with poorer or unknown fossil records.

In their seminal 1967 paper in _Science_ , Sarich and Wilson estimated the
divergence time of humans and apes as four to five million years ago,[70] at a
time when standard interpretations of the fossil record gave this divergence
as at least 10 to as much as 30 million years. Subsequent fossil discoveries,
notably "Lucy", and reinterpretation of older fossil materials, notably
_Ramapithecus_ , showed the younger estimates to be correct and validated the
albumin method.

Progress in DNA sequencing, specifically mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and then
Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) advanced the understanding of human
origins.[71][14][72] Application of the molecular clock principle
revolutionized the study of molecular evolution.

On the basis of a separation from the orangutan between 10 and 20 million
years ago, earlier studies of the molecular clock suggested that there were
about 76 mutations per generation that were not inherited by human children
from their parents; this evidence supported the divergence time between
hominins and chimps noted above. However, a 2012 study in Iceland of 78
children and their parents suggests a mutation rate of only 36 mutations per
generation; this datum extends the separation between humans and chimps to an
earlier period greater than 7 million years ago (Ma). Additional research with
226 offspring of wild chimp populations in 8 locations suggests that chimps
reproduce at age 26.5 years, on average; which suggests the human divergence
from chimps occurred between 7 and 13 million years ago. And these data
suggest that _Ardipithecus_ (4.5 Ma), _Orrorin_ (6 Ma) and _Sahelanthropus_ (7
Ma) all may be on the hominid lineage, and even that the separation may have
occurred outside the East African Rift region.

Furthermore, analysis of the two species' genes in 2006 provides evidence that
after human ancestors had started to diverge from chimpanzees, interspecies
mating between "proto-human" and "proto-chimps" nonetheless occurred regularly
enough to change certain genes in the new gene pool:

                    
                                        A new comparison of the human and chimp genomes suggests that after the two lineages separated, they may have begun interbreeding... A principal finding is that the X chromosomes of humans and chimps appear to have diverged about 1.2 million years more recently than the other chromosomes.
                    

The research suggests:

                    
                                        There were in fact two splits between the human and chimp lineages, with the first being followed by interbreeding between the two populations and then a second split. The suggestion of a hybridization has startled paleoanthropologists, who nonetheless are treating the new genetic data seriously.[73]
                    

### The quest for the earliest hominin[edit]

In the 1990s, several teams of paleoanthropologists were working throughout
Africa looking for evidence of the earliest divergence of the hominin lineage
from the great apes. In 1994, Meave Leakey discovered _Australopithecus
anamensis_. The find was overshadowed by Tim D. White's 1995 discovery of
_Ardipithecus ramidus_ , which pushed back the fossil record to 4.2 million
years ago.

In 2000, Martin Pickford and Brigitte Senut discovered, in the Tugen Hills of
Kenya, a 6-million-year-old bipedal hominin which they named _Orrorin
tugenensis_. And in 2001, a team led by Michel Brunet discovered the skull of
_Sahelanthropus tchadensis_ which was dated as 7.2 million years ago, and
which Brunet argued was a bipedal, and therefore a hominid—that is, a hominin
( _cf_ Hominidae; terms "hominids" and hominins).

### Human dispersal[edit]

Anthropologists in the 1980s were divided regarding some details of
reproductive barriers and migratory dispersals of the genus _Homo_.
Subsequently, genetics has been used to investigate and resolve these issues.
According to the Sahara pump theory evidence suggests that genus _Homo_ have
migrated out of Africa at least three and possibly four times (e.g. _Homo
erectus_ , _Homo heidelbergensis_ and two or three times for _Homo sapiens_ ).
Recent evidence suggests these dispersals are closely related to fluctuating
periods of climate change.[76]

Recent evidence suggests that humans may have left Africa half a million years
earlier than previously thought. A joint Franco-Indian team has found human
artifacts in the Siwalk Hills north of New Delhi dating back at least 2.6
million years. This is earlier than the previous earliest finding of genus
_Homo_ at Dmanisi, in Georgia, dating to 1.85 million years. Although
controversial, tools found at a Chinese cave strengthen the case that humans
used tools as far back as 2.48 million years ago.[77] This suggests that the
Asian "Chopper" tool tradition, found in Java and northern China may have left
Africa before the appearance of the Acheulian hand axe.

#### Dispersal of modern _Homo sapiens_ [edit]

Up until the genetic evidence became available there were two dominant models
for the dispersal of modern humans. The multiregional hypothesis proposed that
the genus _Homo_ contained only a single interconnected population as it does
today (not separate species), and that its evolution took place worldwide
continuously over the last couple of million years. This model was proposed in
1988 by Milford H. Wolpoff.[78][79] In contrast the "out of Africa" model
proposed that modern _H. sapiens_ speciated in Africa recently (that is,
approximately 200,000 years ago) and the subsequent migration through Eurasia
resulted in nearly complete replacement of other _Homo_ species. This model
has been developed by Chris B. Stringer and Peter Andrews.[80][81]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Homo_sapiens_dispersal_routes.jpg/300px-

Homo_sapiens_dispersal_routes.jpg)

Known _H. sapiens_ migration routes in the Pleistocene.

Sequencing mtDNA and Y-DNA sampled from a wide range of indigenous populations
revealed ancestral information relating to both male and female genetic
heritage, and strengthened the Out of Africa theory and weakened the views of
Multiregional Evolutionism.[82] Aligned in genetic tree differences were
interpreted as supportive of a recent single origin.[83] Analyses have shown a
greater diversity of DNA patterns throughout Africa, consistent with the idea
that Africa is the ancestral home of mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam,
and that modern human dispersal out of Africa has only occurred over the last
55,000 years.[84]

"Out of Africa" has thus gained much support from research using female
mitochondrial DNA and the male Y chromosome. After analysing genealogy trees
constructed using 133 types of mtDNA, researchers concluded that all were
descended from a female African progenitor, dubbed Mitochondrial Eve. "Out of
Africa" is also supported by the fact that mitochondrial genetic diversity is
highest among African populations.[85]

A broad study of African genetic diversity, headed by Sarah Tishkoff, found
the San people had the greatest genetic diversity among the 113 distinct
populations sampled, making them one of 14 "ancestral population clusters".
The research also located a possible origin of modern human migration in
south-western Africa, near the coastal border of Namibia and Angola.[86] The
fossil evidence was insufficient for archaeologist Richard Leakey to resolve
the debate about exactly where in Africa modern humans first appeared.[87]
Studies of haplogroups in Y-chromosomal DNA and mitochondrial DNA have largely
supported a recent African origin.[88] All the evidence from autosomal DNA
also predominantly supports a Recent African origin. However, evidence for
archaic admixture in modern humans, both in Africa and later, throughout
Eurasia has recently been suggested by a number of studies.[89]

Recent sequencing of Neanderthal[90] and Denisovan[91] genomes shows that some
admixture with these populations has occurred. Modern humans outside Africa
have 2–4% Neanderthal alleles in their genome, and some Melanesians have an
additional 4–6% of Denisovan alleles. These new results do not contradict the
"out of Africa" model, except in its strictest interpretation, although they
make the situation more complex. After recovery from a genetic bottleneck that
some researchers speculate might be linked to the Toba supervolcano
catastrophe, a fairly small group left Africa and interbred with Neanderthals,
probably in the Middle East, on the Eurasian steppe or even in North Africa
before their departure. Their still predominantly African descendants spread
to populate the world. A fraction in turn interbred with Denisovans, probably
in south-east Asia, before populating Melanesia.[92] HLA haplotypes of
Neanderthal and Denisova origin have been identified in modern Eurasian and
Oceanian populations.[93] The Denisovan EPAS1 gene has also been found in
Tibetan populations.[94] Studies of the human genome using machine learning
have identified additional genetic contributions in Eurasians from an
"unknown" ancestral population potentially related to the Neanderthal-
Denisovan lineage.[95]

A map of early human migrations.

There are still differing theories on whether there was a single exodus from
Africa or several. A multiple dispersal model involves the Southern Dispersal
theory,[96] which has gained support in recent years from genetic, linguistic
and archaeological evidence. In this theory, there was a coastal dispersal of
modern humans from the Horn of Africa crossing the Bab el Mandib to Yemen at a
lower sea level around 70,000 years ago. This group helped to populate
Southeast Asia and Oceania, explaining the discovery of early human sites in
these areas much earlier than those in the Levant.[96] This group seems to
have been dependent upon marine resources for their survival.

Stephen Oppenheimer has proposed a second wave of humans may have later
dispersed through the Persian Gulf oases, and the Zagros mountains into the
Middle East. Alternatively it may have come across the Sinai Peninsula into
Asia, from shortly after 50,000 yrs BP, resulting in the bulk of the human
populations of Eurasia. It has been suggested that this second group possibly
possessed a more sophisticated "big game hunting" tool technology and was less
dependent on coastal food sources than the original group. Much of the
evidence for the first group's expansion would have been destroyed by the
rising sea levels at the end of each glacial maximum.[96] The multiple
dispersal model is contradicted by studies indicating that the populations of
Eurasia and the populations of Southeast Asia and Oceania are all descended
from the same mitochondrial DNA L3 lineages, which support a single migration
out of Africa that gave rise to all non-African populations.[97]

Stephen Oppenheimer, on the basis of the early date of Badoshan Iranian
Aurignacian, suggests that this second dispersal, may have occurred with a
pluvial period about 50,000 years before the present, with modern human big-
game hunting cultures spreading up the Zagros Mountains, carrying modern human
genomes from Oman, throughout the Persian Gulf, northward into Armenia and
Anatolia, with a variant travelling south into Israel and to Cyrenicia.[98]

## Evidence[edit]

The evidence on which scientific accounts of human evolution are based comes
from many fields of natural science. The main source of knowledge about the
evolutionary process has traditionally been the fossil record, but since the
development of genetics beginning in the 1970s, DNA analysis has come to
occupy a place of comparable importance. The studies of ontogeny, phylogeny
and especially evolutionary developmental biology of both vertebrates and
invertebrates offer considerable insight into the evolution of all life,
including how humans evolved. The specific study of the origin and life of
humans is anthropology, particularly paleoanthropology which focuses on the
study of human prehistory.[99]

### Evidence from molecular biology[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Hominidae_chart.svg/330px-

Hominidae_chart.svg.png)

Family tree showing the extant hominoids: humans (genus _Homo_ ), chimpanzees
and bonobos (genus _Pan_ ), gorillas (genus _Gorilla_ ), orangutans (genus
_Pongo_ ), and gibbons (four genera of the family Hylobatidae: _Hylobates_ ,
_Hoolock_ , _Nomascus_ , and _Symphalangus_ ). All except gibbons are
hominids.

The closest living relatives of humans are bonobos and chimpanzees (both genus
_Pan_ ) and gorillas (genus _Gorilla_ ).[100] With the sequencing of both the
human and chimpanzee genome, as of 2012[update] estimates of the similarity
between their DNA sequences range between 95% and 99%.[100][101][102] By using
the technique called the molecular clock which estimates the time required for
the number of divergent mutations to accumulate between two lineages, the
approximate date for the split between lineages can be calculated.

The gibbons (family Hylobatidae) and then orangutans (genus _Pongo_ ) were the
first groups to split from the line leading to the hominins, including
humans—followed by gorillas, and, ultimately, by the chimpanzees (genus _Pan_
). The splitting date between hominin and chimpanzee lineages is placed by
some between 4 to 8 million years ago, that is, during the Late
Miocene.[103][104][105] Speciation, however, appears to have been unusually
drawn-out. Initial divergence occurred sometime between 7 to 13 million years
ago, but ongoing hybridization blurred the separation and delayed complete
separation during several millions of years. Patterson (2006) dated the final
divergence at 5 to 6 million years ago.[106]

Genetic evidence has also been employed to resolve the question of whether
there was any gene flow between early modern humans and Neanderthals, and to
enhance our understanding of the early human migration patterns and splitting
dates. By comparing the parts of the genome that are not under natural
selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly steady rate, it
is possible to reconstruct a genetic tree incorporating the entire human
species since the last shared ancestor.

Each time a certain mutation (single-nucleotide polymorphism) appears in an
individual and is passed on to his or her descendants a haplogroup is formed
including all of the descendants of the individual who will also carry that
mutation. By comparing mitochondrial DNA which is inherited only from the
mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose
genetic marker is found in all modern humans, the so-called mitochondrial Eve,
must have lived around 200,000 years ago.

#### Genetics[edit]

Main articles: Human evolutionary genetics and Human genetic variation

Human evolutionary genetics studies how one human genome differs from the
other, the evolutionary past that gave rise to it, and its current effects.
Differences between genomes have anthropological, medical and forensic
implications and applications. Genetic data can provide important insight into
human evolution.

### Evidence from the fossil record[edit]

There is little fossil evidence for the divergence of the gorilla, chimpanzee
and hominin lineages.[107] The earliest fossils that have been proposed as
members of the hominin lineage are _Sahelanthropus tchadensis_ dating from 7
million years ago, _Orrorin tugenensis_ dating from 5.7 million years ago, and
_Ardipithecus kadabba_ dating to 5.6 million years ago. Each of these have
been argued to be a bipedal ancestor of later hominins but, in each case, the
claims have been contested. It is also possible that one or more of these
species are ancestors of another branch of African apes, or that they
represent a shared ancestor between hominins and other apes.

The question then of the relationship between these early fossil species and
the hominin lineage is still to be resolved. From these early species, the
australopithecines arose around 4 million years ago and diverged into robust
(also called _Paranthropus_ ) and gracile branches, one of which (possibly _A.
garhi_ ) probably went on to become ancestors of the genus _Homo_. The
australopithecine species that is best represented in the fossil record is
_Australopithecus afarensis_ with more than one hundred fossil individuals
represented, found from Northern Ethiopia (such as the famous "Lucy"), to
Kenya, and South Africa. Fossils of robust australopithecines such as _Au.
robustus_ (or alternatively _Paranthropus robustus_ ) and _Au./P. boisei_ are
particularly abundant in South Africa at sites such as Kromdraai and
Swartkrans, and around Lake Turkana in Kenya.

The earliest member of the genus _Homo_ is _Homo habilis_ which evolved around
2.8 million years ago.[108] _Homo habilis_ is the first species for which we
have positive evidence of the use of stone tools. They developed the Oldowan
lithic technology, named after the Olduvai Gorge in which the first specimens
were found. Some scientists consider _Homo rudolfensis_ , a larger bodied
group of fossils with similar morphology to the original _H. habilis_ fossils,
to be a separate species while others consider them to be part of _H. habilis_
—simply representing intraspecies variation, or perhaps even sexual
dimorphism. The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as
that of a chimpanzee, and their main adaptation was bipedalism as an
adaptation to terrestrial living.

During the next million years, a process of encephalization began and, by the
arrival (about 1.9 million years ago) of _Homo erectus_ in the fossil record,
cranial capacity had doubled. _Homo erectus_ were the first of the hominins to
emigrate from Africa, and, from 1.8 to 1.3 million years ago, this species
spread through Africa, Asia, and Europe. One population of _H. erectus_ , also
sometimes classified as a separate species _Homo ergaster_ , remained in
Africa and evolved into _Homo sapiens_. It is believed that these species, _H.
erectus_ and _H. ergaster_ , were the first to use fire and complex tools.

The earliest transitional fossils between _H. ergaster/erectus_ and archaic
_H. sapiens_ are from Africa, such as _Homo rhodesiensis_ , but seemingly
transitional forms were also found at Dmanisi, Georgia. These descendants of
African _H. erectus_ spread through Eurasia from ca. 500,000 years ago
evolving into _H. antecessor_ , _H. heidelbergensis_ and _H.
neanderthalensis_. The earliest fossils of anatomically modern humans are from
the Middle Paleolithic, about 200,000 years ago such as the Omo remains of
Ethiopia; later fossils from Es Skhul cave in Israel and Southern Europe begin
around 90,000 years ago ( 0.09 million years ago).

As modern humans spread out from Africa, they encountered other hominins such
as _Homo neanderthalensis_ and the so-called Denisovans, who may have evolved
from populations of _Homo erectus_ that had left Africa around 2 million years
ago. The nature of interaction between early humans and these sister species
has been a long-standing source of controversy, the question being whether
humans replaced these earlier species or whether they were in fact similar
enough to interbreed, in which case these earlier populations may have
contributed genetic material to modern humans.[109][110]

This migration out of Africa is estimated to have begun about 70,000 years BP
and modern humans subsequently spread globally, replacing earlier hominins
either through competition or hybridization. They inhabited Eurasia and
Oceania by 40,000 years BP, and the Americas by at least 14,500 years BP.[111]

### Inter-species breeding[edit]

Further information: Interbreeding between archaic and modern humans

The hypothesis of interbreeding, also known as hybridization, admixture or
hybrid-origin theory, has been discussed ever since the discovery of
Neanderthal remains in the 19th century.[112] The linear view of human
evolution began to be abandoned in the 1970s as different species of humans
were discovered that made the linear concept increasingly unlikely. In the
21st century with the advent of molecular biology techniques and
computerization, whole-genome sequencing of Neanderthal and human genome were
performed, confirming recent admixture between different human species.[90] In
2010, evidence based on molecular biology was published, revealing unambiguous
examples of interbreeding between archaic and modern humans during the Middle
Paleolithic and early Upper Paleolithic. It has been demonstrated that
interbreeding happened in several independent events that included
Neanderthals and Denisovans, as well as several unidentified hominins.[113]
Today, approximately 2% of DNA from most Europeans and Asians is Neanderthal,
with traces of Denisovan heritage.[114] Also, 4–6% of modern Melanesian
genetics are Denisovan.[114] Comparisons of the human genome to the genomes of
Neandertals, Denisovans and apes can help identify features that set modern
humans apart from other hominin species. In a 2016 comparative genomics study,
a Harvard Medical School/UCLA research team made a world map on the
distribution and made some predictions about where Denisovan and Neanderthal
genes may be impacting modern human biology.[115][116]

For example, comparative studies in the mid-2010s found several traits related
to neurological, immunological,[117] developmental, and metabolic phenotypes,
that were developed by archaic humans to European and Asian environments and
inherited to modern humans through admixture with local hominins.[118][119]

Although the narratives of human evolution are often contentious, several
discoveries since 2010 show that human evolution should not be seen as a
simple linear or branched progression, but a mix of related
species.[91][3][4][5] In fact, genomic research has shown that hybridization
between substantially diverged lineages is the rule, not the exception, in
human evolution.[2] Furthermore, it is argued that hybridization was an
essential creative force in the emergence of modern humans.[2]

## Before _Homo_ [edit]

For evolutionary history before primates, see Evolution of mammals,
Evolutionary history of life, and Timeline of human evolution.

### Early evolution of primates[edit]

See also: Evolution of primates

The evolutionary history of the primates can be traced back 65 million
years.[120] One of the oldest known primate-like mammal species, the
_Plesiadapis_ , came from North America;[121][122][123][124][125][126]
another, _Archicebus_ , came from China.[127] Other similar basal primates
were widespread in Eurasia and Africa during the tropical conditions of the
Paleocene and Eocene.

New York, US.

David R. Begun [128] concluded that early primates flourished in Eurasia and
that a lineage leading to the African apes and humans, including to
_Dryopithecus_ , migrated south from Europe or Western Asia into Africa. The
surviving tropical population of primates—which is seen most completely in the
Upper Eocene and lowermost Oligocene fossil beds of the Faiyum depression
southwest of Cairo—gave rise to all extant primate species, including the
lemurs of Madagascar, lorises of Southeast Asia, galagos or "bush babies" of
Africa, and to the anthropoids, which are the Platyrrhines or New World
monkeys, the Catarrhines or Old World monkeys, and the great apes, including
humans and other hominids.

The earliest known catarrhine is _Kamoyapithecus_ from uppermost Oligocene at
Eragaleit in the northern Great Rift Valley in Kenya, dated to 24 million
years ago.[129] Its ancestry is thought to be species related to
_Aegyptopithecus_ , _Propliopithecus_ , and _Parapithecus_ from the Faiyum, at
around 35 million years ago.[130] In 2010, _Saadanius_ was described as a
close relative of the last common ancestor of the crown catarrhines, and
tentatively dated to 29–28 million years ago, helping to fill an 11-million-
year gap in the fossil record.[131]

Reconstructed tailless _Proconsul_ skeleton

In the Early Miocene, about 22 million years ago, the many kinds of arboreally
adapted primitive catarrhines from East Africa suggest a long history of prior
diversification. Fossils at 20 million years ago include fragments attributed
to _Victoriapithecus_ , the earliest Old World monkey. Among the genera
thought to be in the ape lineage leading up to 13 million years ago are
_Proconsul_ , _Rangwapithecus_ , _Dendropithecus_ , _Limnopithecus_ ,
_Nacholapithecus_ , _Equatorius_ , _Nyanzapithecus_ , _Afropithecus_ ,
_Heliopithecus_ , and _Kenyapithecus_ , all from East Africa.

The presence of other generalized non-cercopithecids of Middle Miocene from
sites far distant— _Otavipithecus_ from cave deposits in Namibia, and
_Pierolapithecus_ and _Dryopithecus_ from France, Spain and Austria—is
evidence of a wide diversity of forms across Africa and the Mediterranean
basin during the relatively warm and equable climatic regimes of the Early and
Middle Miocene. The youngest of the Miocene hominoids, _Oreopithecus_ , is
from coal beds in Italy that have been dated to 9 million years ago.

Molecular evidence indicates that the lineage of gibbons (family Hylobatidae)
diverged from the line of great apes some 18–12 million years ago, and that of
orangutans (subfamily Ponginae) diverged from the other great apes at about 12
million years; there are no fossils that clearly document the ancestry of
gibbons, which may have originated in a so-far-unknown South East Asian
hominoid population, but fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by
_Sivapithecus_ from India and _Griphopithecus_ from Turkey, dated to around 10
million years ago.[21]

### Divergence of the human clade from other great apes[edit]

A reconstruction of "Lucy", a female _Australopithecus afarensis_ on exhibit

Species close to the last common ancestor of gorillas, chimpanzees and humans
may be represented by _Nakalipithecus_ fossils found in Kenya and
_Ouranopithecus_ found in Greece. Molecular evidence suggests that between 8
and 4 million years ago, first the gorillas, and then the chimpanzees (genus
_Pan_ ) split off from the line leading to the humans. Human DNA is
approximately 98.4% identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single
nucleotide polymorphisms (see human evolutionary genetics). The fossil record,
however, of gorillas and chimpanzees is limited; both poor preservation—rain
forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone—and sampling bias probably
contribute to this problem.

Other hominins probably adapted to the drier environments outside the
equatorial belt; and there they encountered antelope, hyenas, dogs, pigs,
elephants, horses, and others. The equatorial belt contracted after about 8
million years ago, and there is very little fossil evidence for the
split—thought to have occurred around that time—of the hominin lineage from
the lineages of gorillas and chimpanzees. The earliest fossils argued by some
to belong to the human lineage are _Sahelanthropus tchadensis_ (7 Ma) and
_Orrorin tugenensis_ (6 Ma), followed by _Ardipithecus_ (5.5–4.4 Ma), with
species _Ar. kadabba_ and _Ar. ramidus_.

It has been argued in a study of the life history of _Ar. ramidus_ that the
species provides evidence for a suite of anatomical and behavioral adaptations
in very early hominins unlike any species of extant great ape.[132] This study
demonstrated affinities between the skull morphology of _Ar. ramidus_ and that
of infant and juvenile chimpanzees, suggesting the species evolved a
juvenalised or paedomorphic craniofacial morphology via heterochronic
dissociation of growth trajectories. It was also argued that the species
provides support for the notion that very early hominins, akin to bonobos (
_Pan paniscus_ ) the less aggressive species of the genus _Pan_ , may have
evolved via the process of self-domestication. Consequently, arguing against
the so-called "chimpanzee referential model"[102] the authors suggest it is no
longer tenable to use common chimpanzee ( _Pan troglodytes_ ) social and
mating behaviors in models of early hominin social evolution. When commenting
on the absence of aggressive canine morphology in _Ar. ramidus_ and the
implications this has for the evolution of hominin social psychology, they
wrote:

> Of course _Ar. ramidus_ differs significantly from bonobos, bonobos having
retained a functional canine honing complex. However, the fact that _Ar.
ramidus_ shares with bonobos reduced sexual dimorphism, and a more
paedomorphic form relative to chimpanzees, suggests that the developmental and
social adaptations evident in bonobos may be of assistance in future
reconstructions of early hominin social and sexual psychology. In fact the
trend towards increased maternal care, female mate selection and self-
domestication may have been stronger and more refined in _Ar. ramidus_ than
what we see in bonobos.[132] :128

The authors argue that many of the basic human adaptations evolved in the
ancient forest and woodland ecosystems of late Miocene and early Pliocene
Africa. Consequently, they argue that humans may not represent evolution from
a chimpanzee-like ancestor as has traditionally been supposed. This suggests
many modern human adaptations represent phylogenetically deep traits and that
the behavior and morphology of chimpanzees may have evolved subsequent to the
split with the common ancestor they share with humans.

### Genus _Australopithecus_ [edit]

Main article: Australopithecus

The genus _Australopithecus_ evolved in eastern Africa around 4 million years
ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming extinct
2 million years ago. During this time period various forms of australopiths
existed, including _Australopithecus anamensis_ , _Au. afarensis_ , _Au.
sediba_ , and _Au. africanus_. There is still some debate among academics
whether certain African hominid species of this time, such as _Au. robustus_
and _Au. boisei_ , constitute members of the same genus; if so, they would be
considered to be _Au. robust australopiths_ whilst the others would be
considered _Au. gracile australopiths_. However, if these species do indeed
constitute their own genus, then they may be given their own name, the
_Paranthropus_.

                    
                                                * _Australopithecus_ (4–1.8 Ma), with species _Au. anamensis_ , _Au. afarensis_ , _Au. africanus_ , _Au. bahrelghazali_ , _Au. garhi_ , and _Au. sediba_ ;
                            * _Kenyanthropus_ (3–2.7 Ma), with species _K. platyops_ ;
                            * _Paranthropus_ (3–1.2 Ma), with species _P. aethiopicus_ , _P. boisei_ , and _P. robustus_
                    

A new proposed species _Australopithecus deyiremeda_ is claimed to have been
discovered living at the same time period of _Au. afarensis_. There is debate
if Au. deyiremeda is a new species or is _Au. afarensis._ [133]
_Australopithecus prometheus_ , otherwise known as Little Foot has recently
been dated at 3.67 million years old through a new dating technique, making
the genus _Australopithecus_ as old as _afarensis_.[134] Given the opposable
big toe found on Little Foot, it seems that he was a good climber, and it is
thought given the night predators of the region, he probably, like gorillas
and chimpanzees, built a nesting platform at night, in the trees.

It has been suggested that this section be split out into another article
titled _Homo_. (Discuss) _(April 2018)_

---|--- 

The earliest documented representative of the genus _Homo_ is _Homo habilis_ ,
which evolved around 2.8 million years ago,[108] and is arguably the earliest
species for which there is positive evidence of the use of stone tools. The
brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a
chimpanzee, although it has been suggested that this was the time in which the
human SRGAP2 gene doubled, producing a more rapid wiring of the frontal
cortex. During the next million years a process of rapid encephalization
occurred, and with the arrival of _Homo erectus_ and _Homo ergaster_ in the
fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled to 850 cm 3.[135] (Such an
increase in human brain size is equivalent to each generation having 125,000
more neurons than their parents.) It is believed that _Homo erectus_ and _Homo
ergaster_ were the first to use fire and complex tools, and were the first of
the hominin line to leave Africa, spreading throughout Africa, Asia, and
Europe between 1.3 to 1.8 million years ago.

A model of the phylogeny of _H. sapiens_ during the Middle Paleolithic. The
horizontal axis represents geographic location; the vertical axis represents
time in thousands of years ago.[136] _Homo heidelbergensis_ is shown as
diverging into Neanderthals, Denisovans and _H. sapiens_. With the expansion
of _H. sapiens_ after 200 kya, Neanderthals, Denisovans and unspecified
archaic African hominins are shown as again subsumed into the _H. sapiens_
lineage. In addition, admixture events in modern African populations are
indicated.

According to the recent African origin of modern humans theory, modern humans
evolved in Africa possibly from _Homo heidelbergensis_ , _Homo rhodesiensis_
or _Homo antecessor_ and migrated out of the continent some 50,000 to 100,000
years ago, gradually replacing local populations of _Homo erectus_ , Denisova
hominins, _Homo floresiensis_ , _Homo luzonensis_ and _Homo
neanderthalensis_.[137][138][139][140][141] Archaic _Homo sapiens_ , the
forerunner of anatomically modern humans, evolved in the Middle Paleolithic
between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago.[142][143][144] Recent DNA evidence
suggests that several haplotypes of Neanderthal origin are present among all
non-African populations, and Neanderthals and other hominins, such as
Denisovans, may have contributed up to 6% of their genome to present-day
humans, suggestive of a limited inter-breeding between these
species.[91][145][93] The transition to behavioral modernity with the
development of symbolic culture, language, and specialized lithic technology
happened around 50,000 years ago according to some anthropologists[146]
although others point to evidence that suggests that a gradual change in
behavior took place over a longer time span.[147]

_Homo sapiens_ is the only extant species of its genus, _Homo_. While some
(extinct) _Homo_ species might have been ancestors of _Homo sapiens_ , many,
perhaps most, were likely "cousins", having speciated away from the ancestral
hominin line.[148][149] There is yet no consensus as to which of these groups
should be considered a separate species and which should be a subspecies; this
may be due to the dearth of fossils or to the slight differences used to
classify species in the genus _Homo_.[149] The Sahara pump theory (describing
an occasionally passable "wet" Sahara desert) provides one possible
explanation of the early variation in the genus _Homo_.

Based on archaeological and paleontological evidence, it has been possible to
infer, to some extent, the ancient dietary practices[35] of various _Homo_
species and to study the role of diet in physical and behavioral evolution
within _Homo_.[32][150][151][152][153]

Some anthropologists and archaeologists subscribe to the Toba catastrophe
theory, which posits that the supereruption of Lake Toba on Sumatran island in
Indonesia some 70,000 years ago caused global consequences,[154] killing the
majority of humans and creating a population bottleneck that affected the
genetic inheritance of all humans today.[155] The genetic and archaeological
evidence for this remains in question however.[156]

### _H. habilis_ and _H. gautengensis_ [edit]

_Homo habilis_ lived from about 2.8[108] to 1.4 Ma. The species evolved in
South and East Africa in the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene, 2.5–2 Ma,
when it diverged from the australopithecines. _Homo habilis_ had smaller
molars and larger brains than the australopithecines, and made tools from
stone and perhaps animal bones. One of the first known hominins was nicknamed
'handy man' by discoverer Louis Leakey due to its association with stone
tools. Some scientists have proposed moving this species out of _Homo_ and
into _Australopithecus_ due to the morphology of its skeleton being more
adapted to living on trees rather than to moving on two legs like _Homo
sapiens_.[157]

In May 2010, a new species, _Homo gautengensis_ , was discovered in South
Africa.[158]

### _H. rudolfensis_ and _H. georgicus_ [edit]

These are proposed species names for fossils from about 1.9–1.6 Ma, whose
relation to _Homo habilis_ is not yet clear.

                    
                                                * _Homo rudolfensis_ refers to a single, incomplete skull from Kenya. Scientists have suggested that this was another _Homo habilis_ , but this has not been confirmed.[159]
                            * _Homo georgicus_ , from Georgia, may be an intermediate form between _Homo habilis_ and _Homo erectus_ ,[160] or a sub-species of _Homo erectus_.[161]
                    

### _H. ergaster_ and _H. erectus_ [edit]

The first fossils of _Homo erectus_ were discovered by Dutch physician Eugene
Dubois in 1891 on the Indonesian island of Java. He originally named the
material _Anthropopithecus erectus_ (1892–1893, considered at this point as a
chimpanzee-like fossil primate) and _Pithecanthropus erectus_ (1893–1894,
changing his mind as of based on its morphology, which he considered to be
intermediate between that of humans and apes).[162] Years later, in the 20th
century, the German physician and paleoanthropologist Franz Weidenreich
(1873–1948) compared in detail the characters of Dubois' Java Man, then named
_Pithecanthropus erectus_ , with the characters of the Peking Man, then named
_Sinanthropus pekinensis_. Weidenreich concluded in 1940 that because of their
anatomical similarity with modern humans it was necessary to gather all these
specimens of Java and China in a single species of the genus _Homo_ , the
species _Homo erectus_. [ _citation needed_ ] _Homo erectus_ lived from about
1.8 Ma to about 70,000 years ago—which would indicate that they were probably
wiped out by the Toba catastrophe; however, nearby _Homo floresiensis_
survived it. The early phase of _Homo erectus_ , from 1.8 to 1.25 Ma, is
considered by some to be a separate species, _Homo ergaster_ , or as _Homo
erectus ergaster_ , a subspecies of _Homo erectus_.

In Africa in the Early Pleistocene, 1.5–1 Ma, some populations of _Homo
habilis_ are thought to have evolved larger brains and to have made more
elaborate stone tools; these differences and others are sufficient for
anthropologists to classify them as a new species, _Homo erectus_ —in
Africa.[163] The evolution of locking knees and the movement of the foramen
magnum are thought to be likely drivers of the larger population changes. This
species also may have used fire to cook meat. Richard Wrangham suggests that
the fact that Homo seems to have been ground dwelling, with reduced intestinal
length, smaller dentition, "and swelled our brains to their current,
horrendously fuel-inefficient size",[164] suggest that control of fire and
releasing increased nutritional value through cooking was the key adaptation
that separated Homo from tree-sleeping Australopithecines.[165]

See also: Control of fire by early humans

A famous example of _Homo erectus_ is Peking Man; others were found in Asia
(notably in Indonesia), Africa, and Europe. Many paleoanthropologists now use
the term _Homo ergaster_ for the non-Asian forms of this group, and reserve
_Homo erectus_ only for those fossils that are found in Asia and meet certain
skeletal and dental requirements which differ slightly from _H. ergaster_.

### _H. cepranensis_ and _H. antecessor_ [edit]

These are proposed as species that may be intermediate between _H. erectus_
and _H. heidelbergensis_.

                    
                                                * _H. antecessor_ is known from fossils from Spain and England that are dated 1.2 Ma–500 ka.[166][167]
                            * _H. cepranensis_ refers to a single skull cap from Italy, estimated to be about 800,000 years old.[168]
                    

### _H. heidelbergensis_ [edit]

Main article: Homo heidelbergensis

_H. heidelbergensis_ ("Heidelberg Man") lived from about 800,000 to about
300,000 years ago. Also proposed as _Homo sapiens heidelbergensis_ or _Homo
sapiens paleohungaricus_.[169]

### _H. rhodesiensis_ , and the Gawis cranium[edit]

                    
                                                * _H. rhodesiensis_ , estimated to be 300,000–125,000 years old. Most current researchers place Rhodesian Man within the group of _Homo heidelbergensis_ , though other designations such as archaic _Homo sapiens_ and _Homo sapiens rhodesiensis_ have been proposed.
                            * In February 2006 a fossil, the Gawis cranium, was found which might possibly be a species intermediate between _H. erectus_ and _H. sapiens_ or one of many evolutionary dead ends. The skull from Gawis, Ethiopia, is believed to be 500,000–250,000 years old. Only summary details are known, and the finders have not yet released a peer-reviewed study. Gawis man's facial features suggest its being either an intermediate species or an example of a "Bodo man" female.[170]
                    

### Neanderthal and Denisovan[edit]

Homo_heidelbergensis_%2810233446%29.jpg)

Reconstruction of _Homo heidelbergensis_ which may be the direct ancestor of
both _Homo neanderthalensis_ and _Homo sapiens_.

_Homo neanderthalensis_ , alternatively designated as _Homo sapiens
neanderthalensis_ ,[171] lived in Europe and Asia from 400,000[172] to about
28,000 years ago.[173] There are a number of clear anatomical differences
between anatomically modern humans (AMH) and Neanderthal populations. Many of
these relate to the superior adaptation to cold environments possessed by the
Neanderthal populations. Their surface to volume ratio is an extreme version
of that found amongst Inuit populations, indicating that they were less
inclined to lose body heat than were AMH. From brain Endocasts, Neanderthals
also had significantly larger brains. This would seem to indicate that the
intellectual superiority of AMH populations may be questionable. More recent
research by Eiluned Pearce, Chris Stringer, R.I.M. Dunbar, however, have shown
important differences in Brain architecture. For example, in both the orbital
chamber size and in the size of the occipital lobe, the larger size suggests
that the Neanderthal had a better visual acuity than modern humans. This would
give a superior vision in the inferior light conditions found in Glacial
Europe. It also seems that the higher body mass of Neanderthals had a
correspondingly larger brain mass required for body care and control.[174]

The Neanderthal populations seem to have been physically superior to AMH
populations. These differences may have been sufficient to give Neanderthal
populations an environmental superiority to AMH populations from 75,000 to
45,000 years BP. With these differences, Neanderthal brains show a smaller
area was available for social functioning. Plotting group size possible from
endocrainial volume, suggests that AMH populations (minus occipital lobe
size), had a Dunbars number of 144 possible relationships. Neanderthal
populations seem to have been limited to about 120 individuals. This would
show up in a larger number of possible mates for AMH humans, with increased
risks of inbreeding amongst Neanderthal populations. It also suggests that
humans had larger trade catchment areas than Neanderthals (confirmed in the
distribution of stone tools). With larger populations, social and
technological innovations were easier to fix in human populations, which may
have all contributed to the fact that modern Homo sapiens replaced the
Neanderthal populations by 28,000 BP.[174]

Dermoplastic reconstruction of a Neanderthal

Earlier evidence from sequencing mitochondrial DNA suggested that no
significant gene flow occurred between _H. neanderthalensis_ and _H. sapiens_
, and that the two were separate species that shared a common ancestor about
660,000 years ago.[175][176][177] However, a sequencing of the Neanderthal
genome in 2010 indicated that Neanderthals did indeed interbreed with
anatomically modern humans _circa_ 45,000 to 80,000 years ago (at the
approximate time that modern humans migrated out from Africa, but before they
dispersed into Europe, Asia and elsewhere).[178] The genetic sequencing of a
40,000 year old human skeleton from Romania showed that 11% of its genome was
Neanderthal, and it was estimated that the individual had a Neanderthal
ancestor 4–6 generations previously,[179] in addition to a contribution from
earlier interbreeding in the Middle East. Though this interbred Romanian
population seems not to have been ancestral to modern humans, the finding
indicates that interbreeding happened repeatedly.[180]

Nearly all modern non-African humans have 1% to 4% of their DNA derived from
Neanderthal DNA,[178] and this finding is consistent with recent studies
indicating that the divergence of some human alleles dates to one Ma, although
the interpretation of these studies has been questioned.[181][182]
Neanderthals and _Homo sapiens_ could have co-existed in Europe for as long as
10,000 years, during which human populations exploded vastly outnumbering
Neanderthals, possibly outcompeting them by sheer numerical strength.[183]

In 2008, archaeologists working at the site of Denisova Cave in the Altai
Mountains of Siberia uncovered a small bone fragment from the fifth finger of
a juvenile member of Denisovans.[184] Artifacts, including a bracelet,
excavated in the cave at the same level were carbon dated to around 40,000 BP.
As DNA had survived in the fossil fragment due to the cool climate of the
Denisova Cave, both mtDNA and nuclear DNA were sequenced.[91][185]

While the divergence point of the mtDNA was unexpectedly deep in time,[186]
the full genomic sequence suggested the Denisovans belonged to the same
lineage as Neanderthals, with the two diverging shortly after their line split
from the lineage that gave rise to modern humans.[91] Modern humans are known
to have overlapped with Neanderthals in Europe and the Near East for possibly
more than 40,000 years,[187] and the discovery raises the possibility that
Neanderthals, Denisovans, and modern humans may have co-existed and interbred.
The existence of this distant branch creates a much more complex picture of
humankind during the Late Pleistocene than previously thought.[185][188]
Evidence has also been found that as much as 6% of the DNA of some modern
Melanesians derive from Denisovans, indicating limited interbreeding in
Southeast Asia.[92][189]

Alleles thought to have originated in Neanderthals and Denisovans have been
identified at several genetic loci in the genomes of modern humans outside of
Africa. HLA haplotypes from Denisovans and Neanderthal represent more than
half the HLA alleles of modern Eurasians,[93] indicating strong positive
selection for these introgressed alleles. Corinne Simoneti at Vanderbilt
University, in Nashville and her team have found from medical records of
28,000 people of European descent that the presence of Neanderthal DNA
segments may be associated with a likelihood to suffer depression more
frequently.[190]

The flow of genes from Neanderthal populations to modern human was not all one
way. Sergi Castellano of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, has in 2016 reported that while Denisovan
and Neanderthal genomes are more related to each other than they are to us,
Siberian Neanderthal genomes show similarity to the modern human gene pool,
more so than to European Neanderthal populations. The evidence suggests that
the Neanderthal populations interbred with modern humans possibly 100,000
years ago, probably somewhere in the Near East.[191]

Studies of a Neanderthal child at Gibraltar show from brain development and
teeth eruption that Neanderthal children may have matured more rapidly than is
the case for Homo sapiens.[192]

### _H. floresiensis_ [edit]

Main article: Homo floresiensis

_H. floresiensis_ , which lived from approximately 190,000 to 50,000 years
before present (BP), has been nicknamed _hobbit_ for its small size, possibly
a result of insular dwarfism.[193] _H. floresiensis_ is intriguing both for
its size and its age, being an example of a recent species of the genus _Homo_
that exhibits derived traits not shared with modern humans. In other words,
_H. floresiensis_ shares a common ancestor with modern humans, but split from
the modern human lineage and followed a distinct evolutionary path. The main
find was a skeleton believed to be a woman of about 30 years of age. Found in
2003, it has been dated to approximately 18,000 years old. The living woman
was estimated to be one meter in height, with a brain volume of just 380 cm3
(considered small for a chimpanzee and less than a third of the _H. sapiens_
average of 1400 cm3).[ _citation needed_ ]

However, there is an ongoing debate over whether _H. floresiensis_ is indeed a
separate species.[194] Some scientists hold that _H. floresiensis_ was a
modern _H. sapiens_ with pathological dwarfism.[195] This hypothesis is
supported in part, because some modern humans who live on Flores, the
Indonesian island where the skeleton was found, are pygmies. This, coupled
with pathological dwarfism, could have resulted in a significantly diminutive
human. The other major attack on _H. floresiensis_ as a separate species is
that it was found with tools only associated with _H. sapiens_.[195]

The hypothesis of pathological dwarfism, however, fails to explain additional
anatomical features that are unlike those of modern humans (diseased or not)
but much like those of ancient members of our genus. Aside from cranial
features, these features include the form of bones in the wrist, forearm,
shoulder, knees, and feet. Additionally, this hypothesis fails to explain the
find of multiple examples of individuals with these same characteristics,
indicating they were common to a large population, and not limited to one
individual.[ _citation needed_ ]

### _H. luzonensis_ [edit]

Main article: Homo luzonensis

A small number of specimens from the island of Luzon, dated 50,000 to 67,000
years ago, have recently been assigned by their discoverers, based on dental
characteristics, to a novel human species, _H. luzonensis_.[196]

### _H. sapiens_ [edit]

Main articles: Archaic humans, Anatomically modern humans, Archaic human
admixture with modern humans, and Homo sapiens § Recent evolution

_H. sapiens_ (the adjective _sapiens_ is Latin for "wise" or "intelligent")
emerged around 300,000 years ago, likely derived from _Homo
heidelbergensis_.[197] Between 400,000 years ago and the second interglacial
period in the Middle Pleistocene, around 250,000 years ago, the trend in
intra-cranial volume expansion and the elaboration of stone tool technologies
developed, providing evidence for a transition from _H. erectus_ to _H.
sapiens_. The direct evidence suggests there was a migration of _H. erectus_
out of Africa, then a further speciation of _H. sapiens_ from _H. erectus_ in
Africa. A subsequent migration (both within and out of Africa) eventually
replaced the earlier dispersed _H. erectus_. This migration and origin theory
is usually referred to as the "recent single-origin hypothesis" or "out of
Africa" theory. _H. sapiens_ interbred with archaic humans both in Africa and
in Eurasia, in Eurasia notably with Neanderthals and Denisovans.[91][92]

The Toba catastrophe theory, which postulates a population bottleneck for _H.
sapiens_ about 70,000 years ago,[198] was controversial from its first
proposal in the 1990s and by the 2010s had very little support.[199]
Distinctive human genetic variability has arisen as the result of the founder
effect, by archaic admixture and by recent evolutionary pressures.

## Use of tools[edit]

See also: Hunting hypothesis

The use of tools has been interpreted as a sign of intelligence, and it has
been theorized that tool use may have stimulated certain aspects of human
evolution, especially the continued expansion of the human brain.[200]
Paleontology has yet to explain the expansion of this organ over millions of
years despite being extremely demanding in terms of energy consumption. The
brain of a modern human consumes about 13 watts (260 kilocalories per day), a
fifth of the body's resting power consumption.[201] Increased tool use would
allow hunting for energy-rich meat products, and would enable processing more
energy-rich plant products. Researchers have suggested that early hominins
were thus under evolutionary pressure to increase their capacity to create and
use tools.[202]

Precisely when early humans started to use tools is difficult to determine,
because the more primitive these tools are (for example, sharp-edged stones)
the more difficult it is to decide whether they are natural objects or human
artifacts.[200] There is some evidence that the australopithecines (4 Ma) may
have used broken bones as tools, but this is debated.[203]

Many species make and use tools, but it is the human genus that dominates the
areas of making and using more complex tools. The oldest known tools are
flakes from West Turkana, Kenya, which date to 3.3 million years ago.[204] The
next oldest stone tools are from Gona, Ethiopia, and are considered the
beginning of the Oldowan technology. These tools date to about 2.6 million
years ago.[205] A _Homo_ fossil was found near some Oldowan tools, and its age
was noted at 2.3 million years old, suggesting that maybe the _Homo_ species
did indeed create and use these tools. It is a possibility but does not yet
represent solid evidence.[206] The third metacarpal styloid process enables
the hand bone to lock into the wrist bones, allowing for greater amounts of
pressure to be applied to the wrist and hand from a grasping thumb and
fingers. It allows humans the dexterity and strength to make and use complex
tools. This unique anatomical feature separates humans from apes and other
nonhuman primates, and is not seen in human fossils older than 1.8 million
years.[207]

Bernard Wood noted that _Paranthropus_ co-existed with the early _Homo_
species in the area of the "Oldowan Industrial Complex" over roughly the same
span of time. Although there is no direct evidence which identifies
_Paranthropus_ as the tool makers, their anatomy lends to indirect evidence of
their capabilities in this area. Most paleoanthropologists agree that the
early _Homo_ species were indeed responsible for most of the Oldowan tools
found. They argue that when most of the Oldowan tools were found in
association with human fossils, _Homo_ was always present, but _Paranthropus_
was not.[206]

In 1994, Randall Susman used the anatomy of opposable thumbs as the basis for
his argument that both the _Homo_ and _Paranthropus_ species were toolmakers.
He compared bones and muscles of human and chimpanzee thumbs, finding that
humans have 3 muscles which are lacking in chimpanzees. Humans also have
thicker metacarpals with broader heads, allowing more precise grasping than
the chimpanzee hand can perform. Susman posited that modern anatomy of the
human opposable thumb is an evolutionary response to the requirements
associated with making and handling tools and that both species were indeed
toolmakers.[206]

### Stone tools[edit]

Main article: Stone tool

Stone tools are first attested around 2.6 Million years ago, when hominins in
Eastern Africa used so-called core tools, choppers made out of round cores
that had been split by simple strikes.[208] This marks the beginning of the
Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age; its end is taken to be the end of the last Ice
Age, around 10,000 years ago. The Paleolithic is subdivided into the Lower
Paleolithic (Early Stone Age), ending around 350,000–300,000 years ago, the
Middle Paleolithic (Middle Stone Age), until 50,000–30,000 years ago, and the
Upper Paleolithic, (Late Stone Age), 50,000–10,000 years ago.

Archaeologists working in the Great Rift Valley in Kenya have discovered the
oldest known stone tools in the world. Dated to around 3.3 million years ago,
the implements are some 700,000 years older than stone tools from Ethiopia
that previously held this distinction.[204][209][210][211]

The period from 700,000–300,000 years ago is also known as the Acheulean, when
_H. ergaster_ (or _erectus_ ) made large stone hand axes out of flint and
quartzite, at first quite rough (Early Acheulian), later "retouched" by
additional, more-subtle strikes at the sides of the flakes. After 350,000 BP
the more refined so-called Levallois technique was developed, a series of
consecutive strikes, by which scrapers, slicers ("racloirs"), needles, and
flattened needles were made.[208] Finally, after about 50,000 BP, ever more
refined and specialized flint tools were made by the Neanderthals and the
immigrant Cro-Magnons (knives, blades, skimmers). In this period they also
started to make tools out of bone.

## Transition to behavioral modernity[edit]

Further information: Behavioral modernity

Until about 50,000–40,000 years ago, the use of stone tools seems to have
progressed stepwise. Each phase ( _H. habilis_ , _H. ergaster_ , _H.
neanderthalensis_ ) started at a higher level than the previous one, but after
each phase started, further development was slow. Currently
paleoanthropologists are debating whether these _Homo_ species possessed some
or many of the cultural and behavioral traits associated with modern humans
such as language, complex symbolic thinking, technological creativity etc. It
seems that they were culturally conservative maintaining simple technologies
and foraging patterns over very long periods.

Around 50,000 BP, modern human culture started to evolve more rapidly. The
transition to behavioral modernity has been characterized by most as a
Eurasian "Great Leap Forward",[212] or as the "Upper Palaeolithic
Revolution",[213] due to the sudden appearance of distinctive signs of modern
behavior and big game hunting[98] in the archaeological record. Some other
scholars consider the transition to have been more gradual, noting that some
features had already appeared among archaic African _Homo sapiens_ since
200,000 years ago.[214][215] Recent evidence suggests that the Australian
Aboriginal population separated from the African population 75,000 years ago,
and that they made a sea journey of up to 160 km 60,000 years ago, which may
diminish the evidence of the Upper Paleolithic Revolution.[216]

Modern humans started burying their dead, using animal hides to make clothing,
hunting with more sophisticated techniques (such as using trapping pits or
driving animals off cliffs), and engaging in cave painting.[217] As human
culture advanced, different populations of humans introduced novelty to
existing technologies: artifacts such as fish hooks, buttons, and bone needles
show signs of variation among different populations of humans, something that
had not been seen in human cultures prior to 50,000 BP. Typically, _H.
neanderthalensis_ populations do not vary in their technologies, although the
Chatelperronian assemblages have been found to be Neanderthal innovations
produced as a result of exposure to the Homo sapiens Aurignacian
technologies.[218]

Among concrete examples of modern human behavior, anthropologists include
specialization of tools, use of jewellery and images (such as cave drawings),
organization of living space, rituals (for example, burials with grave gifts),
specialized hunting techniques, exploration of less hospitable geographical
areas, and barter trade networks. Debate continues as to whether a
"revolution" led to modern humans ("the big bang of human consciousness"), or
whether the evolution was more "gradual".[147]

## Recent and current human evolution[edit]

Main article: Recent human evolution

Evolution has continued in anatomically modern human populations, which are
affected by both natural selection and genetic drift. Although selection
pressure on some traits, such as resistance to smallpox, has decreased in
modern human life, humans are still undergoing natural selection for many
other traits. Some of these are due to specific environmental pressures, while
others are related to lifestyle changes since the development of agriculture
(10,000 years ago), urban civilization (5,000), and industrialization (250
years ago). It has been argued that human evolution has accelerated since the
development of agriculture 10,000 years ago and civilization some 5,000 years
ago, resulting, it is claimed, in substantial genetic differences between
different current human populations.[219]

Particularly conspicuous is variation in superficial characteristics, such as
Afro-textured hair, or the recent evolution of light skin and blond hair in
some populations, which are attributed to differences in climate. Particularly
strong selective pressures have resulted in high-altitude adaptation in
humans, with different ones in different isolated populations. Studies of the
genetic basis show that some developed very recently, with Tibetans evolving
over 3,000 years to have high proportions of an allele of EPAS1 that is
adaptive to high altitudes.

Other evolution is related to endemic diseases: the presence of malaria
selected for sickle cell trait (the heterozygote form of sickle cell gene),
while the absence of malaria and the health effects of sickle-cell anemia
select against this trait. For example, the population at risk of the severe
debilitating disease kuru has significant over-representation of an immune
variant of the prion protein gene G127V versus non-immune alleles. The
frequency of this genetic variant is due to the survival of immune
persons.[220][221]

Recent human evolution related to agriculture includes genetic resistance to
infectious disease that has appeared in human populations by crossing the
species barrier from domesticated animals,[222] as well as changes in
metabolism due to changes in diet, such as lactase persistence.

In contemporary times, since industrialization, some trends have been
observed: for instance, menopause is evolving to occur later.[223] Other
reported trends appear to include lengthening of the human reproductive period
and reduction in cholesterol levels, blood glucose and blood pressure in some
populations.[223]
