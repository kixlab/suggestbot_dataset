# Number of Americans Without Health Insurance Rose by 3 Million in 2017:

Gallup

The number of Americans without healthcare insurance rose by 3.2 million
people between 2016 and 2017, or 1.3 percentage points to 12.2 percent,
according to a Gallup poll released on Tuesday, the biggest jump in the
uninsured rate in nearly a decade.

Several factors likely contributed to the jump, Gallup said, including
attempts by Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress and the White
House, to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly called
Obamacare. The law extended health insurance to 20 million Americans.

Republicans have so far failed to make good on President Donald Trump's
campaign promise to end Obamacare, but they repealed the so-called individual
mandate, or requirement that most Americans purchase health insurance or else
pay a fine, in a tax bill that passed in December. The jump in uninsured
followed a consistent decline between 2014 and 2016, the time period when much
of Obamacare was being implemented, after peaking at 18 percent in 2013,
Gallup said. With the repeal of the individual mandateand insurance premiums
that are likely to continue rising, the uninsured rate will likely increase
further in coming years, the pollster said.

The Trump administration has said it was wrong to force Americans to sign up
for healthcare, as Obamacare did. It did not immediately respond to a request
for comment.

The uninsured rate rose among all demographic groups in 2017, except those 65
and older, who qualify for Medicare, the government health insurance program
for the elderly. But young adults, blacks, Hispanics and low-income Americans
saw the biggest rise in the uninsured rate, Gallup found. Young and healthy
consumers, in particular, are needed to help offset the costs of older, sicker
and more expensive patients.

The overall jump in uninsured was the biggest since Gallup began the poll in
2008.

Gallup said media coverage of repeated attempts to repeal and replace
Obamacare, former President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy
achievement, may have caused confusion among consumers. It also pointed to
health insurers who pulled out of the Obamacare individual market due to
uncertainty, leaving consumers with fewer and more expensive choices, which
may have prompted some to forego coverage.

Trump administration decisions to slash the Obamacare advertising budget by 90
percent and cut the sign-up period in half also likely played a role in the
rise of uninsured Americans, Gallup said.

This is largely due to CHOICE, not government removing coverage that some
think is a right.

The choice is partially affected by the Death Spiral of ACA, which was
INTENTIONALLY caused by architects of that disaster… to lead to Single Slayer,
er, Single Delayer, er, Single Payer Socialistic Health Insurance.

(Anticipated) Removal of the mandate is the key reason some choose to not
insure. Hooray for freedom to chose under the current administration rather
than the out of control Federal Government acting in a manner that violated
the US Constitution!
