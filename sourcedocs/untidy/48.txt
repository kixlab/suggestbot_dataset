From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to navigation Jump to search

The U.S. Supreme Court has issued numerous rulings on the use of capital
punishment (the death penalty). While some rulings applied very narrowly,
perhaps to only one individual, other cases have had great influence over wide
areas of procedure, eligible crimes, acceptable evidence and method of
execution.

Year | Case | Ruling | Vote  
---|---|---|---  
1879 | _Wilkerson v. Utah_ | Firing squad is constitutional. | 9-0  
1890 | _In reKemmler_ | Electrocution is constitutional. | 9-0  
1905 | _Rooney v. North Dakota_ | Adoption of private execution versus public
execution after sentence does not violate the Ex post facto clause. | 9-0  
1915 | _Malloy v. South Carolina_ | Retroactively changing the execution
method does not violate the Ex post facto clause. | 9-0  
1932 | _Powell v. Alabama_ | Courts are required to ensure that, in capital
cases, indigent defendants who do not represent themselves must be appointed
counsel. | 7-2  
1947 | _Francis v. Resweber_ | Re-execution after a failed attempt does not
constitute cruel and unusual punishment nor double jeopardy. | 5-4  
1968 | _Witherspoon v. Illinois_ | A state may not have unlimited challenge
for cause of jurors who might have any objection to the death penalty. (See
also _Morgan v. Illinois_ (1992)) | 6-3  
1971 | _McGautha v. California_ | The death penalty can be imposed by a jury
without standards to govern its imposition, and a unitary guilt and punishment
trial is constitutional. (Overruled in _Furman v. Georgia_ , 1972, and _Gregg
v. Georgia_ , 1976) | 6-3  
1972 | _Furman v. Georgia_ | Death sentences in these cases were
unconstitutional. There were no opinion of the court nor even a plurality—each
justice of the five-member majority issued his own concurrence without joining
any other. The ruling caused all death sentences pending at the time to be
reduced to life imprisonment and made all previous capital punishment statutes
void. | 5-4  
1976 | _Gregg v. Georgia_ | Post- _Furman_ death penalty statutes providing a
bifurcated trial in capital cases to decide guilt and punishment are
constitutional. | 7-2  
1976 | _Woodson v. North Carolina_ | Statutes providing mandatory imposition
of the death penalty are unconstitutional. | 5-4  
1977 | _Coker v. Georgia_ | The death penalty is an unconstitutional
punishment for rape of an adult woman when the victim is not killed. | 6-3  
1978 | _Lockett v. Ohio_ | Sentencing authorities must have the discretion to
consider every possible mitigating factor, rather than being limited to a
specific list of factors. | 6-2  
1980 | _Beck v. Alabama_ | Jury must be allowed to consider lesser included
offense, not just capital offense or acquittal. | 7-2  
1980 | _Godfrey v. Georgia_ | Murder must involve a narrow and precise
aggravating factor to be punishable by death. | 6-3  
1982 | _Enmund v. Florida_ | Death penalty is unconstitutional for a person
who is a minor participant in a felony and does not kill, attempt to kill, or
intend to kill. | 5-4  
1984 | _Pulley v. Harris_ | There is no constitutional requirement for a
proportionality review of sentences in comparable cases throughout a state. |
7-2  
1984 | _Spaziano v. Florida_ | It is constitutional for a judge rather than
jury to decide aggravating factors. (Overruled by _Ring v. Arizona_ , 2002). |
6-3  
1986 | _Ford v. Wainwright_ | Execution of an insane convict is
unconstitutional. | 5-4  
1987 | _Tison v. Arizona_ | Death penalty may be imposed on a felony-murder
defendant who was a major participant in the underlying felony and exhibits
extreme indifference to human life. | 5-4  
1987 | _McCleskey v. Kemp_ | Racial disparities not recognized as a
constitutional violation of "equal protection of the law" unless intentional
racial discrimination against the defendant can be shown. | 5-4  
1987 | _Sumner v. Shuman_ | A death sentence cannot be mandatory even for a
murder committed by a prisoner already serving a life sentence without the
possibility of parole. | 6-3  
1988 | _Lowenfield v. Phelps_ | The aggravating factor making the crime
punishable by death may be found in the definition of the crime itself as long
it is enough narrow and precise. | 7-2  
1988 | _Thompson v. Oklahoma_ | Capital punishment for crimes committed at 15
or less is unconstitutional. | 5-3  
1989 | _South Carolina v. Gathers_ | Admission of a victim impact statement at
the sentencing phase of a death penalty-trial is unconstitutional. (Overruled
in _Payne v. Tennessee_ , 1991) | 5-4  
1989 | _Stanford v. Kentucky_ | The death penalty for crimes committed at age
16 or 17 is constitutional. (Overruled in _Roper v. Simmons_ , 2005) | 5-4  
1989 | _Penry v. Lynaugh_ | Executing persons with mental retardation is
constitutional. (Overruled in _Atkins v. Virginia_ , 2002) | 5-4  
1990 | _Walton v. Arizona_ | Judge-finding of aggravating factors is
constitutional. The aggravating factor "especially heinous, cruel, or
depraved" is not unconstitutionally vague. (First holding overruled in _Ring
v. Arizona_ , 2002) | 5-4  
1991 | _Payne v. Tennessee_ | Victim impact statements are admissible during
the penalty phase of a capital case. | 6-3  
1992 | _Morgan v. Illinois_ | A defendant may challenge for cause a
prospective juror who would automatically vote to impose the death penalty in
every capital case. | 6-3  
1993 | _Herrera v. Collins_ | In the absence of other constitutional grounds,
federal courts have no power to rule on innocence claims based on newly
discovered evidence. | 6-3  
1995 | _Schlup v. Delo_ | A condemned man can bypass the procedural bar on
successive federal habeas petitions if he show that "a constitutional
violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually
innocent". | 5-4  
1995 | _Harris v. Alabama_ | Alabama scheme allowing the judge to impose a
death sentence and making the jury recommendation non-binding even when it
calls for life imprisonment is constitutional. | 8-1  
2002 | _Ring v. Arizona_ | A death sentence where the necessary aggravating
factors are determined by a judge violates a defendant's constitutional right
to a trial by jury, as the jury should determine if there are such factors
sufficient to allow the death penalty. | 7-2  
2002 | _Atkins v. Virginia_ | The execution of mentally retarded offenders is
unconstitutional. | 6-3  
2004 | _Schriro v. Summerlin_ | The _Ring v. Arizona_ decision does not apply
retroactively to cases already final on direct review. | 5-4  
2005 | _Roper v. Simmons_ | The death penalty for those who had committed
their crimes under 18 years of age is unconstitutional. | 5-4  
2006 | _Oregon v. Guzek_ | States may limit the evidence of innocence a
defendant may present at his sentencing hearing to evidence already presented
at his trial. | 8-0  
2006 | _Hill v. McDonough_ | Challenging constitutionality of the execution
method is a §1983 lawsuit, not a habeas corpus petition, and thus not subject
to the procedural bar on successive petitions. | 9-0  
2006 | _Kansas v. Marsh_ | Imposing the death penalty when mitigating and
aggravating factors are in equipoise is constitutional. | 5-4  
2008 | _Medellín v. Texas_ | Because the treaty was not self-executing, it was
not binding to the states without a statute adopted by Congress. | 6-3  
2008 | _Baze v. Rees_ | Kentucky's lethal injection method using sodium
thiopental is constitutional. | 7-2  
2008 | _Kennedy v. Louisiana_ | The death penalty is unconstitutional for
child rape and other non-homicidal crimes against the person. | 5-4  
2009 | _Harbison v. Bell_ | Indigent death row inmates sentenced under state
law have a right to federally funded habeas counsel in post-conviction state
clemency proceedings, when the state has denied such counsel. | 7-2  
2011 | _Leal Garcia v. Texas_ | Courts cannot stay an execution on the basis
of the future possibility that Congress enact a statute to enforce an
international law. | 5-4  
2014 | _Hall v. Florida_ | IQ tests alone can not be used as a rigid limit for
determining intellectual disability. | 5-4  
2015 | _Glossip v. Gross_ | To be unconstitutional, a method of execution must
involve any risk of harm which is substantial when compared to a _known and
available_ alternative method. The condemned has the burden of proof. | 5-4  
2016 | _Hurst v. Florida_ | Florida law giving judges the power to decide
facts related to sentencing violates the Sixth Amendment in light of _Ring_ ,
which requires a jury to determine if there are aggravating factors making the
crime punishable by death. | 8-1  
2019 | _Bucklew v. Precythe_ | _Baze v. Rees_ and _Glossip v. Gross_ govern
all Eighth Amendment challenges alleging that a method of execution inflicts
unconstitutionally cruel pain. Petitioner’s as-applied challenge to Missouri’s
single-drug execution protocol—that it would cause him severe pain because of
his particular medical condition—fails to satisfy the Baze-Glossip test. | 5-4
