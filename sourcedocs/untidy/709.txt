>> **Habibullo Ismailovich Abdussamatov** (Russian: Хабибулло Исмаилович
Абдусаматов; occasionally spelled, Abdusamatov; with initials transliterated
either H.I. or K.I; born October 27, 1940 in Samarkand, Uzbek SSR, Soviet
Union) is a Russian astrophysicist of Uzbek descent. He is the supervisor of
the Astrometria[1] project of the Russian section of the International Space
Station and the head of Space research laboratory at the Saint Petersburg-
based Pulkovo Observatory[2][3] of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He
believes that global warming is primarily caused by natural processes.[4]

>> ## Career[edit]

>>

>> Abdussamatov has worked at the Pulkovo Observatory since 1964, as a
researcher trainee, postgraduate, junior researcher, senior researcher,
leading researcher, and then head of the Space Research Laboratory.[5] He
became head of the Space Research Sector of the Pulkovo Observatory and head
of the Selenometria project on the Russian segment of the International Space
Station.

>> ## Climate views and predictions[edit]

>>

>> ### Solar variation[edit]

>>

>> Abdussamatov presented papers at the fourth and ninth International
Conference on Climate Change,[6] events sponsored by the Heartland Institute
and, according to the organiser, bringing together "think tank cosponsors and
[...] scientists who dispute the claim that _the science is settled_ ".[7]
Abdussamatov claims that "global warming results not from the emission of
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but from an unusually high level of
solar radiation and a lengthy—almost throughout the last century—growth in its
intensity."[8] This view contradicts the mainstream scientific opinion on
climate change.[9][10][11] He has asserted that "parallel global
warmings—observed simultaneously on Mars and on Earth—can only be a
straightline consequence of the effect of the one same factor: a long-time
change in solar irradiance."[12] This claim has not been accepted by the
broader scientific community. Some other scientists have stated that "the idea
just isn't supported by the theory or by the observations" and that it
"doesn't make physical sense."[13][14]

>>

>> Abdussamatov holds that Earth's atmosphere does not produce a greenhouse
effect, stating "Ascribing 'greenhouse' effect properties to the Earth's
atmosphere is not scientifically substantiated."[15] He further states that
"Heated greenhouse gases, which become lighter as a result of expansion,
ascend to the atmosphere only to give the absorbed heat away." [15]

>>

>> ### 21st Century Mini-Ice Age[edit]

>>

>> In early 2012, Abdussamatov predicted the onset of a new "mini-ice age"
commencing 2014 and becoming most severe around 2055.[16] His prediction
gained traction in the press after the harsh 2013/2014 winter, despite the
fact that winter was only harsh in eastern North America.[17] In 2012
Abdussamatov quantified declining trend Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) and
predicts further bicentennial based declining TSI.[18]
