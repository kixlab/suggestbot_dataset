# Abortion is murder

![](https://www.archbalt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/CR_Circle.jpg)Catholic
Review

__January 19, 2012

__News

No matter how one looks at it, abortion is murder.

The science of embryology states that from the moment of conception, a human
being is formed. The DNA it has is not only human DNA but the DNA of an
individual distinct from that of either parent. In forensic criminology DNA is
used to distinguish one person from another. So the DNA of an embryo indicates
that the embryo is a person.

To aid a person who engages in abortion or promotes abortion makes one an
accessory to murder.

What has been said above is science, not faith. Anyone who says that he
personally opposes abortion but will not publicly oppose it because he does
not want to impose his faith on others is talking nonsense. It is a matter of
science, not faith.

Our faith teaches us that murder is a grave sin and that one who approves of
anyoneâ€™s murder and promotes murder also commits a grave sin.

We now have politicians who approve of and support abortion, the murder of the
defenseless child. How can we say that voting for such politicians is not
grave sin? We need to keep all this in mind when we come to vote in November.
