## Math! How much CO2 is emitted by human on earth annually?

March 27, 2007 at 3:56 am (Environment, Math!)

Another math time! 🙂

And again, it is closely related to GW area.

Currently (as of year 2007), human population on earth is 6.6 billion (via
wikipedia). I went around to look for how much CO2 is exhaled out per person,
and 2 claims were found (both via wikipedia):

claim#1: an average person's respiration generates approximately 450 liters
(roughly 900 grams) of carbon dioxide per day (CO2#Human_physiology)

> I use the standard chemistry textbook theory (standard molar volume) to
check this claim, 450L for 900 grams of CO2, and it is tallied.

>

> Thus, the amount of CO2 released by human per day is 0.9 kg/day

claim#2: In an average resting adult, the lungs take up about 250ml of oxygen
every minute while excreting about 200ml of carbon dioxide.
(Respiratory_system)

> So, 200 ml per minute and thus 200 ml x 60 X 24 = 288L

>

> Or equivalent to 565.36g/per day = 0.565 kg/day (after divide with standard
molar volume constant and times with CO2 molar weight).

>

> Apparently claim#2 has lower CO2 emission compared to claim#1, but I will
use both anyway to show the comparison.

So, if there is 6.6 billion people out there and excreting CO2 at the rate of
0.9 or 0.565 kg/day, the total CO2 emission by human alone annually is:

claim#1: CO2 emission = 0.90 X 365 x 6 600 000 000

= **2.168 x 10^9 tonnes/year**

claim#2: CO2 emission = 0.565 x 365 x 6 600 000 000

= **1.362 x 10^9 tonnes/year**

But human activities, through the fossil fuel burning activities, releases
24.136 x 10^9 tonnes per year (via wikipedia).

So, **human breathing process** contribute to about 8.99% (claim#1) or 5.65%
(claim#2) compared to the fuel burning related CO2.

Conclusion? May be stop breathing does not really help in reducing CO2
emission! 😛

Your math is off in example number 1 the answer should be 2.168 x 10^12
tonnes/year.

Thats off by 1000 times do your math again.

He switched units from Kg to metric tonnes.  
It is 2.168 * 10^12 Kg.  
However, you must divide by 1,000 to derive the number of metric tonnes; thus,
2.168 * 10^9 is correct.

Hi Brian:  
0.90 kg/day x 365 days x 6 600 000 000 = 2.168×10^12 kg or 2.168×10^9
tonnes/year (1 tonne=1000 kg). I skipped the kg conversion to tonnes part.
Checked if the number is tallied with yours.

By my coarse calculation a typical car generates about as much CO2 as 12
people. That means 6.5 billion people are equivalent to 500 million cars.

Neil, how do you describe a "typical" car? half way between a real car and the
new jelly beans? miles driven per day? gas (perish the thought fossil) mileage
per gallon?

I think you figures might be the other way around if u factor in all the
variables.

Typical (average) cars mean that every car is accounted for. Just like when
average global temperatures are measured , every weather station is accounted
for. Therefore, if every car is added up, then the more efficient cars are
knocked down by less efficient cars, making Chapman's statement completely
valid. All the variables are factored in. Just accept it. The only way to stop
global warming is to stop breathing, and make all the animals, whales,
zooplankton, and bacteria to stop breathing. Have fun and let me know how it
goes.

Hi Neil:  
Well, let's say a typical car emit 200g CO2 per 1 km travelled, and for a car
to generate 12 persons CO2:12×0.9 kg = 10.8 kg CO2, that would be equivalent
to 54km travelling distance per day. Do you drive your car that much? 🙂

Very interesting stuff! Also useful for someone like myself whom is convinced
global warming isn't our fault (well, cars and CO2 anyway). My maths teacher
told me that 50% (could've misheard it, might be 15%) of CO2 emissions are
emitted by the production of concrete. Can anyone back this up? Thanks!

PS: I heard the average human emitted 400kg (0.4 tonnes) of CO2 a year so
0.4[tonnes] x 6600000000 = 2640000000 (tonnes 2.64 x 10^9 tonnes/year I think)

> 2.168 x 10^9 tonnes/year. Not sure what total CO2 emissions are and haven't
the time to work it out!

Well Ed, your average 400kg per year is definitely slightly higher than my
daily 0.9kg (less than 1 kg per day x 365 days will definitely less than
400kg/year), so your calculation would yield higher number than mine. As for
the concrete production, sorry for not hearing about that before. A quick
check at Wikipedia, I guess the CO2 was released by Portland cement component
in concrete " Portland cement, which is made primarily from limestone, certain
clay minerals, and gypsum, in a high temperature process that drives off
carbon dioxide and chemically combines the primary ingredients into new
compounds."

Thanks for the info mich.  
I checked again with my maths teacher, and she is convinced it is 51% (CO2
emitted by concrete/cement [?] production). But then again, she is just a bit
mad…  
I only got the 400kg pa figure from a letter written to the motoring magazine,
Top Gear, so I don't know how valid that is. Thanks again for the very useful
article.

The catch with cement factory emissions, is that in the hardening of the lime
(calcium oxide) back into limestone (calcium carbonate), the primary
ingredient in concrete to make it harden, the CO2 is put back in, so the net
effect is entirely from the burned fossil fuels required to heat the limestone
and cook it into lime, and not of the product itself. And that's with a
rediculously efficient process. You want to talk terrible emissions, gas
lawnmowers spit out all sorts of terrible crap and are horribly inefficient.
Even candles are horribly inefficient as a light source.  
Tell your teacher to do HER homework next time she tries to tell you to do
yours 😛

This s not really a math question, but a thought of why with technology
advancing at such a rate, hasnt anybody invented/discovered a method of
changing CO2 into base elements carbon and oxygen. Please forgive my ignorance
if there is a simple answer to this.

Plants have figured it out. It's called Photosynthesis. The energy input that
makes it expensive comes from sunlight. The problem is, if you burn the plant
or let it decay where gases can re-enter the atmosphere, the CO2 returns to
the atmosphere.

Well, the problem is breaking a stable molecule like CO2 into base C and O
requires energy (be it natural process like photosynthesis or artificial), so
it will eventually comes back to original question: where do you get the
energy from?

erh does n't

6H2O + 6CO2 -------> C6H12O6+ 6O2

six molecules of water plus six molecules of carbon dioxide produce one
molecule of sugar plus six molecules of oxygen

so basically if we breath toward a big enough sunlit plant while we water it -
that should sort our our own individual carbon offset !!!! and we get to have
some sugar for our latte too

Alot! We survive off an atmosphere that is 21% oxygen. Plants survive off of
the 0.003% of the atmosphere that is made up of carbon dioxide. They need
0.063 the amount of atmospheric gas people do.

How much carbon dioxide is contained in one cubic metre of limestone.

An average quantity would be most helpful to me as I need to kinow how much is

Human breathing process is not contributing to net gain of CO2 because:

"human exhalation of carbon dioxide is part of a closed system. There can be
no net addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere because the amount of
carbon dioxide we exhale can’t be greater than the carbon we put into our
bodies by eating plants, or eating animals that eat plants. The plants got the
carbon from the atmosphere via photosynthesis."  
http://www.gcrio.org/doctorgc/index.php/drweblog/C53/

And, yes, the solution is planting trees. In my childhood days, the mantra was
"5 trees per person and we're fine". Have no idea if this was scientifically

Wouldn't it make more sense to say that Human excrement is part of a closed
system? Human breathing is the conversion of oxygen to carbon dioxide.

Hello econerds! Does it not occur to anyone that humans are not the only
carbon dioxide emitting organisms on earth? Please try calculating CO2
emissions for all life. Eat your pets first, but only make jerky out of them
by sun drying.

I think that teacher means 51% of CO2 from manufacturing (metal refining is
another big contributor in this category). Cement accounts for more like 5 to
10% of TOTAL CO2 emissions. Even livestock contribute more CO2 emissions than
the cement industry. Beef livestock account for 9% of CO2 (but 37% of methane
and 65% of NOx, which have greater potential warming effect than CO2).  
By the way, the total amount of atmospheric CO2 only rises by about half of
the total global emissions each year. The other half gets absorbed by the
oceans. Basically, shellfish need it to make the CaCO3 for their shells.

More likely, the 51% came from a stack analysis at a cement plant.

The flue gas leaving the process would be a combination of the combustion
products, which are mostly N2 and CO2 plus excess O2 if needed to minimize CO,
plus the CO2 from the limestone calcination.

The carbon molecule you breathe out has come from a plant, or an animal that
ate a plant. While the plant was growing, it took in this carbon molecule from
the atmosphere, in the form of CO2. So the whole process is carbon neutral
obviously. The same applies for all life on earth, and there is no net effect
on global warming.

Apart from when the carbon molecules are formed with hydrogen to make methane
(think cows). Since methane is 12? times as effective a greenhouse gas than
CO2, a CO2 molecule taken up by the plant ends up as a CH4 molecule in the
atmosphere.

By the theory that the carbon we breathe came from a plant (or animal that ate
a plant), we could use the same theory that fossil fuels come from fossilised
plants or fossilised animals that ate plants and are thus carbon neutral. The
theory (whilst being technically true) is obviously flawed, not least in that
around the world, forests are being burned to make room for farmland to feed
the ever expanding population. We are thereby losing a constant in the
equation (trees).

It is true that the whole world is a closed system, with fixed amounts of
carbon, oxygen and other elements. The problem is the balance between the
forms of these elements. Currently we appear to be producing CO2 (gaseous
form) faster that it is being re-absorbed as pants and trees (solid form).  
Actually the Human Race is the problem, not only through breathing out CO2,
but by consumption too. The world would be in balance with a smaller
population. Population growth is the real problem to everything!

Has anyone considered that plant life on earth may be limited by the fact that
CO2 is less than 0.04% of the content of air. By contributing extra CO2 we
could actually be encouraging plant life to develop as there would be higher
concentrations of CO2 for the plant to breathe and thus allow to grow. Even if
we clear forests etc, the plants will still find a way to thrive as life
always has. Maybe we will see plants grow further inland thus creating more
rains (as the oxygen meets hydrogen in the air and creates clouds/rain) on
mainlands. To me this is common sense. Can anyone point out otherwise?

The problem is that you have all fallen for the construct that CO2 is bad and
causes global warming.  
ALL GASES are greenhouse gases.  
Our atmosphere is 79% Nitrogen, 20% Oxygen, 1% everything else. The everything
else makes only a small component of how radiant energy is trapped by the
atmosphere. And CO2 is only 0.2% of the atmosphere. Now, on the other hand,
Methane is MUCH more dense than O2, CO2, or N2. If you accept the great Global
Warming Religion, we should all be burning as much natural gas as possible
(currently seeping out of the ocean floor at an alarming rate) and converting
it to CO2 and H2O.  
BTW, the "Science" behind Global Warming is being proven fraudulent.  
The 1990s and 2000s were NOT the hottest period in modern history, the 1930s
were. The methodology of putting an ever increasing number of weather stations
in urban an suburban settings (heat sinks- steel, concrete, and asphalt), in
some cases next to air conditioning exhaust on rooftops, and comparing them
against different measuring devices with less accuracy and, trying to
statistically compare to within a fraction of a gradient (not possible on the
older instruments) is the very definition of UnScientific.  
The last 2 years have been frigid, just as the last 3 Atlantic Hurricane
Seasons after Algore's movie have been unusually quiet.

Oh, and the Earth is NOT a closed System. Heat from the Earth comes from The
Sun. The Sun is not a constant. Global warming Religion makes no room for
varying output from The Sun in it's models. Strange, huh.

What people don't understand is that the earth does not have a constant cycle
as you say above. They see one year and assume that's normal. Then some
politician starts using propaganda like CO2 emissions to trick people into
supporting pollution control (EPA) which in turn sets a bunch of regulations
to make us burn more fuel to benefit the oil companies with the claim that it
reduces emissions.

One claim i see all the time is that CO2 is at record highs since the
industrial revolution with a graph of carbon dioxide concentrations from 1900
until now. Yes, 1900 was a low period in concentration. Back up to 1800 and
you'll find current concentrations now are lower than they were then. In the
1700s we had severe cold. Concentrations of CO2 were not likely the cause but
more likely a result of the fluctuation in Earth's cycle.

I came to this site late. Where did we get the idea that C02 is dangerous or
that the world is in a period of man-made global warming caused by a C02
canopy around the earth which is creating a "greenhouse' in which warm
greenhouse gases from earth are trapped thereby raising earth's temperatures
ala man-made global warming???

Whew.

Talk about run-on sentences. But you get the point. I think its all a lot of
(for lack of a better word) crap. There is no man made global warming. Co2 is
not dangerous at all. In fact it is an intergral part of our life system. Al
Gore is nuts.

So how come so many scientists follow the lead of this silly pied piper? I
guess for the same reason so many experts once thought the Sun revolved around
the Earth or that the Earth was flat. Swimming with the current is always
easier than going against it.

Look. Global warming is nonsense. Any one of the people who visit a site like
this is capable of understanding this fact if they want to. So let's review:

A canopy of C02 now surrounds the earth creating a sealed-in 'greenhouse'.
Below the canopy, earth's warm greenhouse gases can not escape the earth so
they reamain raising the Earth's temperature. Each day taht the canopy stays
in place, the Earth must get warmer. Each day, warmer than the day before.
Unless we fine an escape for the trapped heat or turn off the heater (the
greenhouse gases), we are doomed to ever-increasing temperatures and
eventually DEATH FROM WARMING.

(This is terribly different from what these same guys said in 1975 when they
used all the same words except one: then they used the word COOLING, now they
use the word WARMING.

Both conclusion came from analysis of the same data.

BUT - and it's a big but -  
Last week (July 2008), the NOAA released this statement:  
"Five of the last twelve years were above the 180-year mean. This means they
were the five warmest years on record." (That's a paraphrase but that's the
gist of it.)

So, this is what the last 12 year's temperatures looked like, beginning in
1995: cooler/cooler/cooler/warmer/cooler/  
cooler/cooler/cooler/cooler/warmer/cooler/warmer (2006).

Now I ask you, what kind of greenhouse is that? Is there a leak? Did someone
turn off the greenhouse gases. Are those hot gases escaping out the hole in
the ozone layer???

Can't you see greenhouses don't work like that? If you have a sealed in area
with a constant source of heat and no way for the heat to escape, the
temperature inside that greenhouse must be as warm or warmer than the day
before. It can NEVER be cooler than the day before. And you can't have a
cooler season following a warmer season. It's downright silly.

If man-made global warming were real as Gore (the winner of the Nobel Prize -
god help us all), but if Gore was right,  
all four seasons would be merging into one. The summers would be hotter, the
springs would be hotter, the falls would be hotter and the winters would be
hotter. And since we have had the Industrial Age for over 180 years, by now
our seasons would be gone.

No, there is no man-made global warming. That's just nonsense. If some seasons
are warmer and some are cooler as shown by the NOAA statement, that's called
WEATHER. And the things that account for that are (1) Solar Activity and (2)
water vapor (or droplets) in the air. And that doesn't come from us, that
comes from nature.

So what's this all about? Blaming C02 means blaming American Industry. This
leads to taxes on industry which leads to less drilling in America which leads
to our corporations going out of business and our economy failing. Which leads
to the re-distribution of our wealth and the destruction of capitalism and the
introduction of marxist/socialism to the United States.

Far feteched? Why? The C02 scare (remember the ozone hole blamed on C02??
Remember the global cooling scare blamed on C02? Now you have the same scare
tactics with global warming.) The goal is to destroy America's wealth.

Today, because of this C02 nonsense, we don't drill for oil. But we still use
it. We HAVE to use it, there is no real alternative today. So we buy it and
send $700,000,000,000 dollars out of America to foreign countries. They are
doing very well, their econmomies are booming, and ours? Ours is collapsing.
And this is all an accident? This is all because scientists can't figure out
we do not live in a greenhouse? When its own government says each year,
temperatures alternate between warmer and cooler? They can't stand up and say
Mr. Gore, you are an idiot?

Can't or won't? If it's won't, why not? Could it be fear of reprisals?

There is no man made global warming and for now I am ont convinced there is no
ongoing warming at all. In fact, here is a prediction: if solar activity
doesn't pick up soon (in the next 3 years) we are in for a prolonged period of
GLOBAL COOLING.

Your calculations on human CO2 respiration are OK, but I couldn't confirm your
number of 24.136 X 10^9 tonnes per year at your linked Wikipedia site.
Instead, at that site the first figure has two graphs, and the lower graph has
a blue line for the total fossil fuel burning rate. At year 2000, the end of
the graph, the rate is 6.6 X 10^12 kg Carbon/year. That is 6.6 X 10^9 tonnes
Carbon/year, roughly one fourth your value.

So instead of 8.99% under claim #1 as you state, the number is 33%.

This number is significant, especially compared to the total flux from the red
line on that same Wikipedia chart. It's about 3.9 X 10^12 kg Carbon/year at
year 2000, or 3.9 X 10^9 tonnes C/yr. Now your calculation is 2.168/3.9 = 56%
of the total (net actually) atmospheric CO2 rate.

Jeff,  
Please bear in mind that the weight of CO2 is not the same as Carbon itself.  
C + O2 -> CO2 [12 + 2*16 -> 44g]. By using this equation, you will get
6.6×10^12 kg C/year is equal to 24.136 x 10^12 kg CO2.

Michelle,

Your are correct, and 8.99% it is.

Your reference to "24.136 tonnes per year (via Wikipedia)" might be better
written as "24.136 tonnes CO2 per year" especially because that number does
not appear in the reference, and because you made two unit conversions, the
explicit change from kg to tonne, but a silent one from C to CO2, to apply the
reference. The IPCC claims to have uniformly used the mass of C in CO2 to
represent the mass of CO2. In your citation, Wikipedia refers to “9.1PgC y^-1
of total anthropogenic emissions”, a carbon reference standing for CO2 mass
rate.

Still, my error.

CO2 absorbs all of the IR after just a few metres. Only when it gets into the
higher atmosphere from aircraft does it cause some mild warming, which will
taken a few thousand years to raise the temp by 6 degrees. This won't happen
because the Earth has a thermostat: its called precipitation. This is not
factored into IPCC computer sims. Also by the time CO2 really takes effect the
Earth will be in the Taurid streams cluster. By the year 3000 these will be
smashing into the atmosphere, polluting us with hydrogen cyanide (the cause of
the Black Death) and if large enough, some may even cool the global
temperature down by putting dust into the higher atmosphere.

Global warming-global cooling-there's enough math and science out  
there to prove that "global warming" does not occur by the hand of man;  
When a volcano explodes its natural gases into the upper atmosphere,  
nature deals with it.. more gases than man can produce in 500 years of  
manufacturing.. Yet we sit around and let Al Gore collect a "mammy" for  
promoting the global warming hoax on the population of the world..  
-C02-a natural and occuring gas in the creation of the earth and the production of life's forces- Maybe Obama will take up the idea of  
taxing the American people on their C02 emissions..What's next-the  
toilet tax? Aren't liberals great??

There are so many uncertainties in this topic, I don't understand how anyone
can claim that burning fossil fuels will destroy the planet. The whole
"greenhouse gas" idea is still just a theory, and it is in no way even close
to being proven to be a reality. Lets say it is a reality, and CO2 does
actually trap heat from the sun, how can we consider this to be a bad thing?
The earth has experienced much higher temperatures in the past, and life has
thrived during those times. It was even much warmer than this when human
civilization began. What if the energy from the sun becomes reduced in the
near future? We will be wishing we could trap all of the heat that we could.

Everyone is crying about the ice caps melting, but everyone forgets that they
have been melting since thousands of years before fossil fuels were ever used.
Polar animals will either adapt or go extinct, which is a process called
evolution, which has been going on for billions of years on Earth. Then again,
this global warming is supposed to put us in a new ice-age right? So the polar
bears and Eskimos outta be thinking us when that happens.

I have a little theory of my own: I think these scientists and research
organizations have bills to pay. And the only way they can make money is from
government grants. To get a grant, you have to do some convincing and
persuasive writing. The data that is PRODUCED by these organizations serves
that purpose. Their claims depend on the urgent fear of cataclysm to convince
the government that there research is important and warrant funding. Throwing
in suggestions like gas and industry taxes is like icing on the cake for
lawmakers.

At least that is my theory. Just like the theory of global warming, I can't
prove it to be real. But I can certainly prove it to be a problem for the
world, and our economy if it were in fact real.

And one more thing: Why is something that emits less CO2 considered "green"?
Really, think about it. Since there is often a little leaf or tree depicted on
a "green" product, I am guessing that the term green comes from plants. GUESS
WHAT, PLANTS LOVE CO2. I would consider the top CO2-producing machines to be
the "greenest".

As a matter of fact, the last seven years have been cooler than the previous
ones. This doesn't prove a thing except that there is a natural variation in
the climate of the earth that has been ongoing since its formation. The ice
age was over about ten thousand years ago and since then, the erarth has been
growing warmer. That statement is true by the obvious facts. Question: What
caused the warming of the earth at the end of the ice ages?

Probably the amount of hot air exhaled by liberals.

Your whole approach to calculating the human contribution to the emission of
CO2 is entirely misleading. The 0,04% CO2 is in the air we INHALE, what we
need to know is the ADDITIONAL amount of CO2 added to the exhaled air. It is
NOT your value of about 900 grams per day. Please ask your food experts for
the average daily food consumption and what percentage of carbon does it
contain that is converted to CO2 - presumably this would lead to a much lower
value.

Human respiration may rise from 8 litres/minute to as much as 100
litres/minute depending upon the level of exercise.As we are only quiescent
for about one third of the day, semi-active for one third and probably pretty
active for one third it seems that the calculations are in need of some
revision.

The extent of C02 CH4 and H2S from the earths own activities such as volcanic
action perma-frost changes etc., would appear to be far more significant than
our own activities. This is not to say that we "should mess the place up" far
from it.

Our volcanoes alone spew forth 150,000 tons of Hg. each year so that we have
evolved breathing another of the favourite "whipping Boys".

Thank you, thank you, thank you, for this site. Common sense is finally
starting to break out.

I would like to step away form CO2 for a minute and make a few quick
comments:-  
1. The sun (Sol) is a 1% variable star with cycle of 100 years this means that the Earth's temperature has to vary by 3K or 3 degrees centigrade over past 100 years.  
2. The Earth's axis precess around the galactic plane about 24500 Years.  
3. So too does the major axis of the the Earth's orbit around Sol (4 hours per year).  
4. Sol has an 11 year Sun spot cycle.  
All of these effect Global climate.

As for Global warming:-  
1. The so called increase is between .3 and .7 degrees centigrade, but the instrument only has a resolution of 1 degree, which means the measurement can only be stated at + or - 1 degree centigrade, this places global warming in the noise band of the instrument. (Why is it that none of the published data show error bands on the data)  
2. if you preform a Fast Fourier Transform on the data (I have) the result is an even distribution of frequencies and amplitudes which means the data is noise.

According to Albert Miller and Jack C. Thompson, Elements of Meteorology p.7  
there is 2300 billion tons of CO2 in the atmosphere which represents about
0.32% and we produce about 6 billion tons per year which is 0.26% of that or
0.0008% of the total atmosphere.

Perhaps we can save the planet by buying each "greenie" a pocket calculator
and teaching them how to use it!!

Yet, the general population is completely convinced by pictures of polar
bears. The greenies only need a pocket calculator to add up all of our tax
money they are getting to fund their bogus research.

Oh, and I made a snowman last week, down here on the Texas Gulf Coast, south
of Houston, one of the hottest cities in the country. And it's not even Winter
yet. It must be because SUV sales are down this year… Or the Cash-for-Clunkers
program abruptly reduced CO2 levels? I wish the Global Warming was real,
because I'm f'in cold right now.

Actually, the CO2 we breath out contributes 0% to global warming. It is
"carbon neutral," meaning it does not take carbon that has been trapped
underground for millions of years and put it into the atmosphere. Instead, we
breath in oxygen, we eat carbon-based foods, we release CO2. Plants breath in
our CO2 and use it to produce carbon-based foods. That is the natural cycle of
an ecosystem. Fossil fuels involve digging up ancients forests and spewing
billions of tons of pollutants into the air that are way beyond our
ecosystem's ability to handle.

I always believed the typical adult exhales about a kilo a day, but a lot
depends on activity. If you take CO2 seriously, you might need to tax athletes
more than lazy people! Seriously, though, the calculations are reasonably
accurate.  
The best cross-check is to look up the enthalpy of formation of CO2 (I think
some 390KJ/mol) and relate the daily energy demands of a healthy adult to the
CO2 output. If a human needs 10,000 kJ a day (in general) then daily output of
CO2 must be some 25 mole, or a little over 1000 g for a day's exhalation. But
all these figures are approximations and averages. The average American eats
almost twice the calories of the average Bangla Deshi, so that is one source
of possible error.

A good analysis except for the use of resting CO2 exchange. By definition
resting CO2 is calculated in the absence of voluntary muscle movement; a state
were are rarely if ever in. Consequently you would need to at east double
perhaps triple the exchange figure of 200ml to represent daily human
activities this would increase your final figures to 15 - 24% of annual CO2
production which is not insignificant.

Cows and soil bacteria are included in the Kyoto breif, and are considered a
source of GHG, but apparently only our cows and the fields we use?? what about
the forests. Given that methane is a common byproduct of bacterial activity
then you would have to assume many animals emit a volume of GHG besides C02,
so a forest with its high level of biodiversity will have a higher density of
living animals to a mono culture of a farming field. So which emits more GHG
forest or field. Does the US get credit for wiping out and replacing billions
of bision with a smaller number of cows??  
There was a mini Ice Age during the European dark ages, a small warming event
during the roman empire hense the human population densities (more during
Roman times).  
The Alps were created by the advance and retreat of the Glaciers, how can they
advance and retract if the temp is constant. In fact the route that Hanable
took to cross the alps is not passable today it is under Glaciers.  
There is plenty of evedence of sea levels changing hense cities underwater in
the med, this must also be global temps causing the ice caps the melt and
freeze.  
Tim Flanery (Australian Scientest into GW) claimed there was no climate
science 10 years ago and they have the models pretty much perfect now, wally
pity every other science cant get their act together 100's of year and they
still dont have it all worked out as well. He is a C#$k head.  
Wikipedia says C02 use to follow global temp, not the other way climate
scientest claim that the opisite is true based on amoung other things as
fosilised plankton values adjust for temp, all values adjust for some factor
or another.  
The real question is why anybody expect our system to be stable at all, a big
ball of rock orbited by another ball of rock, orbiting with many other ball of
rock and gas around an uncontrolled ball of fusion reactions, all of them
affecting the other causing small shifts in orbit.

Why do some of you say that human breathing is part of a closed loop system vs
cars that are not? Thats the best you've got is it? If there were no mammals,
insects etc on earth the plants would die, compress and turn into fossil
fuels. We prevent that by eating the food and releasing the co2 into the air.
The "loop" is the whole system. The planet can manage itself thanks very much,
it has before and will again. If there is a problem it is that there are TOO
MANY PEOPLE. You need a few wars, some pestilance, a plague or twenty, and
some population control - or you could just f. off to some other planets and
annoy the martians…. mars has global warming too by the way… I guess the
Martians drive SUVs too eh?

Your problem is your trying to measure a planet which functions in a scale of
events that works in millions of years with a brain that thinks ten years is a
long time. What bloody use is "five of the last 12 years have been hot or
cold"? Planets do work like that - you might as well wave at a snail. Once you
have a million years data to work with, let me know. Until then, the best
thing you can do is kill yourself - no cremation - get your body turned into a
tarmac or diamonds - or throw yourself into space. You are not a god. If God
exists, he will sort it out.

People power seems to be one of the defining trends in the 21st century.
Imagine in 20 years time when I'm about to have my heart operation, I will
read through internet blogs, decide on the technique I think is most suitable,
and inform my surgeon of how I would like him to proceed with the op. After
all, he's only a surgeon who cuts this and attaches that, how hard can it be?
As scientists are blokes in white coats with a sinister agenda, dodgy methods
and are out to scare us with distorted facts for their own gain, I am going to
put my trust in a random selection of car mechanics, oil workers and McDonalds
staff to get a balanced view of climate change. There, that'll teach those
good-for-nothing scientists. The fact that the majority of the people who look
at the numbers, the climate models, the polar ice cap melting, the species
losses and the weather patterns agree just goes to show how much of a

of training by millions to one so hell, lets rev up our cars and show 'em we

Ian,

…"I am going to put my trust in a random selection of car mechanics, oil

Ah, another one who thinks that only scientists have the mental powers to make
deductions. Great. No doubt you think poor people are a different class, rich
people are the elite of society and that women are the weaker sex too. The
thing is you forgot to add into your descriptive mix the seemingly thousands
of scientific peers, great minds and knowledgeable people who also think it's
a rubbish argument. The thing is though, from what I can see, most of the
people who are 'disbelievers' are actually open to argument, rather than the
blinkered group that are just blindly following the biggest shouters.

…"There, that’ll teach those good-for-nothing scientists"…

I don't think anybody said the scientists were good-for-nothing, the fact that
your reduced to such polarising scaremonger tactics shows how weak your
argument is.

…"The fact that the majority of the people who look at the numbers, the
climate models, the polar ice cap melting, the species losses and the weather
patterns agree just goes to show how much of a conspiracy it is."…

Assuming that your being sarcastic, you might want to consider your own
statement… all these events just happen to have also occurred at least once
before the human race even existed, I don't think we've found any fossilised
4x4s but hey, it's possible I suppose.

Quite why you compare a physical operation on human anatomy which is a well
practised art (and STILL one we don't fully understand), with speculation
about cosmic events and meteorological conditions which we plainly haven't a
scoobies about (We can't even reliably predict the local weather ffs!) I have
no idea.

There doesn’t appear to be a single fact in your argument, and not a single
fact repudiating the other facts outlined here by others: "Must try harder" is
all I can add - but perhaps you could just take up politics instead, they
mostly spout meaningless drivel too in order to score cheap points.

So according to this artical, carbon dioxide is a lie. It is said that about
24,136,000,000 kg is produced every year worldwide but the atmosphere is
5,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg of gas with a composition of 0.039% carbon
dioxide. It has been proven that the earth would still flourish at ten times
that value (0.39%) but even if we burnt fuel for a thousand years, we would
increase the level of CO2 by 4.8272 × 10-6% points (0.000004872%).

Some facts:  
You make one kg Co2 a day is if you are sitting down all day. If you do
anything, even just walk, it is significantly more.  
One kg is indeed equivalent to driving 50 km. Most people do not drive, and
even in the US most people do not drive that much every day.  
Humans are not the largest population on Earth. There is about 800 kg of
termites for every kg of human. They breathe too. There is more insects of all
kind than termites, it is just the single biggest group as one species. They
breathe too. And there is much more living stuff in the oceans than on dry
land, probably a thousand times more. They breathe too.  
And if there is a little more CO2 in the atmosphere, every tree will grow one
more leaf.

http://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/ghg_report/pdf/tbl11.pdf

From that, I get that each person in the US on average produces 17 kg of CO2
from transportation alone every day, which is a lot more than the 0.9 kg
figure cited for human respiration. And that's not counting powering homes and
buildings, manufacturing, etc.

And all the carbon in that 0.9 kg CO2 comes from food, which ultimately comes
from plants grown within a year before consumption. All the carbon in plants,
including the parts of them we eat, or that an animal ate to get all their
carbon which we then eat, comes from atmospheric CO2. So all the CO2 I emit in
a year will, on balance, be used by plants to ultimately make the food I'll
eat in the next year. It cancels out, not to mention that the US operates at a
significant grain surplus.

So that's 2 reasons why breathing isn't considered something which will
greatly increase atmospheric CO2: It's removed from the atmosphere roughly at
the rate it's put back in, and it's insignificant compared with the amount
that's put into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels.

I would also like to point out that in the last 400,000 years, over the course
of 4 ice ages and thaws, CO2 levels have fluctuated between 180 and 280 ppmv.
So in the normal cycle, it takes about 50,000 years for atmospheric CO2 to
increase by 100 ppmv. But in the last 200 years, we've gone from 280 to over
390 ppmv. We've gone up by 50 ppmv in the last 30 years alone. That's over 800
times faster than nature, and the rate that we're putting CO2 in the
atmosphere is only increasing. And we were already at peak CO2 when we
started, so all of this is on top of the highest CO2 levels the Earth has
experienced in the last 400,000 years.

Just saying, you don't have to be brainwashed to find those numbers alarming…

Turn the car off no co2, try that with a human, then try and turn them both on

factory or machine only when it is in use.

To all the naysayers of global warming: You're idiots. If you don't think the
waste and pollution being belched out by 7 billion people has no impact you're
a fool. The additional CO2 we emit by unnatural means far outweighs that of
our own exhalation. It is a significant percentage of natural emissions -
including those of volcanoes. It doesn't matter anyway. A slight increase in
overall temperature reduces the amount of gas stored in water in the oceans.
That means more CO2 being emitted now by water into the atmosphere, thus
raising the temperature even yet more and so on and so on. It has escalated
beyond the point of no return. There's a saying, "Don't shit in your own
backyard." Well, we shat and shat and the number of people made the entire
Earth our backyard and it's swamped with shit. We'll breath it until we all
die, which will be a hell of a lot sooner than we think. All pretty much due
to our lack of respect for our natural surroundings and downright greed. So
keep arguing the point, dumbshits, you should be writing your own epitaphs.

My calculations suggest 1.25 x 10^12 tonne p.a. based on my knowledge of
physiology and allowing for the variation based on distribution of body weight
and age. Almost all measurements are quoted at rest and do not allow for the
increased CO2 production with exercise or work, which can peak at 7 times base
line production.  
The amount of CO2 is very significant particularly if one is cognisant of the
time frame of the expected doubling of the world population with it's
implications for not only expired CO2 but also CO2 generated as a by product
of man's living on this planet.  
The only action that will succeed in reducing green house gasses must include
a concerted effort to end the relentless increase in world population.

Who, on this earth will be the first to die for the environment?

Humans evolved over 200,000 years or so. In the future, we might evolve like
fish where we need little oxygen, and may need to breathe in CO2 in future
years to survive.

What happens then, do we dust off our ancient coal fired stations?, do we put
plastic bags around cow's behinds so we can savour the methane?

Seriously, the doom and gloom predictors are full of crock. It's the tilting
of the earth's axis that's causing the major climate change, every 10,000 to
20,000 years. Yes at the moment, the earth is tilting slightly more towards
the horizontal, exposing more of the polar ice caps to more sunlight, wouldn't
you think this would cause the present ice melt in the Artic and Antartic. Yes
the earth wobbles as it spins. This causes huge shifts of water, hence
earthquakes, and stresse the earth's outer skin, causing volcanoes to erupt
and pour untold quantities of gases into the atmosphere! By comparison, man
made gases on the scale of global warming/coolind is like a little boy peeing
in the ocean. Or as King Canute found out, you can't empty the oceans with a
bucket.

God help us from these scientific morons.

Why don't we focus on how to remove co2 from the atmosphere. I feel the focus
of global  
Warming whether through population growth, greenhouse gas or solar activity
isn't the a solution.  
The green people want to eliminate fossil fuels which I feel currently is very
unlikely for the next 30 years or more. Money needs to be focused on research
not production of. completely inadequate solutions both from a financial and
grid parity argument. We are wasting billions subsidizing cars, solar panels
and other green energy. The billions spent in subsidize to oil is a fraction
considering the last time I was on the road most drivers seem to be using oil.

To be honest, oil is basically carbon that was removed from the atmosphere, as
is natural gas, coal, wood, charcoal and most other fuels. Plants, the ocean
and other bodies of water, certain mineral formations suck it up. The warmer
it is, the more is absorbed by through the air-water interface. If it cools,
than CO2 counes out of solution. Try pouring a carbonated drink at room
temperature and then over ice. The difference in the bubble rate demonstrates
the relationship between the saturation point for the soluent in the solvent
when solvent temperature varies.  
If the world cools off, the OCEAN releases CO2. If it warms up, it absorbs it.
That's what's called a buffering effect. And man has not a single thing to do
with it.

No one has mentioned the effect of the periodic tilting of the Earth's major
axis. This is the cyclical event that causes warming and cooling every 24,500
years or so. At the same time, the emission of CO2 is only a very small
generator of warmth, or rather, trapping of the earth's warmth, generated by
the sun.

To the polluters out there, you might be right in saying it will not cause
doomsday to appear next year, but hell, I object to breathing in all those
polluting nasties like CO, NO, SO2, CFC, ETC., which I wouldn't have a century
ago.

I also object to not seeing blue skies in places like Beijing. Don't go to
China for a holiday, you won't breathe properly, your throat will be on fire,
your eyes will weep and sting, and there's no escape. You will never see blue
skies (or stars for that matter) in Beijing. Worst experience of my 70 year
life.

These IPCC goons have you guys calculating antropogenic CO2 emmissions like
drones when that isn't even real problem. We produce 0.014% of the greenhouse
gases through fossil fuel burning and human respiration COMBINED. Furthermore
CO2 is only a mere 0.4% of the atmosphere. The majority greenhouse gas is
water vapor (85%). Neither H2O nor CO2 are poisons nor are they harmful to
life on earth. Increased CO2 levels actually causes plants to thrive more. If
you want to reverse greenhouse warming then dump 50% of the earths water on
rockets and launch em into space. Or create a huge parasol to block out the
sun.

I've heard that the act of sex is the equivalent of a 5-mile run. Whoever said

Seriously, though, the Al Gores of the world are profiting at the expense of
the rest of us. The quasi-scientists of the IPPC have been proven to be not
only wrong but dishonest. Data that did not match hypotheses were discarded.
Scientific Method requires resolution of irregularities, not "casting out
nines".  
Anthropogenic climate change is a micro-effect. I have seen it. Houston, Texas
in the early '70's built an area called Greenway Plaza. Rainfall patterns
around Houston moved northwest because the approximate area of concrete and
asphalt doubled toward the nothwest.  
It is definitely not a macro-effect. Driving a car in Sydney Australia only
affects the north pole's ice fields in chaos theory. The butterfly-hurricane
relationship. And chaos theory does not allow attribution.  
Bottom line is that the tendency of government is to expand into the available
field of "governed" is a fixed natural law. Saul Alinsky taught that the best
way to get action is to create an emergency need.  
The U.N. would very much like to become the world government. Washington will
continue to attenuate the effectiveness of State governments. Individual
rights will continue to be bypassed by a corrupt Congress (a pox on both their
houses), Executive and Judiciary.  
I do not know whether the Tree of Liberty is a net carbon dioxide asset but I
do believe that the time approaches for it to be watered with the blood of
patriots and tyrants. (Thomas Jefferson, paraphrased.)  
The Constitution's Article 1 gives the Senate the power of treaty
ratification. Article 2 gives the Executive the power to make treaties.
Article 6 states that the Constitution, laws passed consistent with it and
treaties shall be the Law of the Land. Harry Reid has a majority, RINOs could
make it a 2/3 majority and the UN can remove pieces of the Bill of Rights one
at a time.  
But Article 5 makes it possible for the States to come together and amend the
constitution. The legislatures of 2/3 of the States can agree to an Article 5
Convention, present amendments germaine to thair stated purpose and present
them for ratification. 3/4 of the States can then ratify and the Congress,
Executive and Judiciary are powerless to stop the process.  
Talk to your State legislators and get the process started before the EPA
makes a wetland out of your kid's wading pool. And don't think that's a joke.
The Clean Air Act has already been expanded by the Supreme Court to allow EPA
to declare CO2 a POLLUTANT. Want to breathe freely? Buy Carbon Credits.

Climate change is inevitable, carbon dioxide and monoxide pollution or not.
Man is only hastening the process.

Why? Because the real cause has very little to do with man. However, man can
have an effect beyond his position in scale.  
How?, It's because the earth wobbles.  
When? Over the next 10,000-25,000 years  
Where? The whole earth.  
What? Please explain!

• The sun causes heating and lack of sun causes cooling of the earth’ surface.  
• The earth’s surface exposed to the sun gets hot, the area not exposed gets
cold. Thus we have a hot equator and cold poles.  
• The earth is spinning about the north and south pole axis, as it spins about
the sun. (The actual path taken by the earth is mathematically complex, but
predictable).  
• Heating more sea area as against land area has a profound effect on air
currents as well as sea currents. In addition, the air over the equator is
moving much faster than air over the poles, so differential currents occur.
This is the main cause of wind and things like typhoons and hurricanes.  
• The “wobble” of the earth’s spin is very slight, but enough to tilt the
earth’s axis by up to 27.5 °. This cycle is around 25,000 years, tilting the
axis from minimum to maximum.  
• As the earth tilts, the cold poles are exposed to more sunlight, ice melt
occurs, conversely the equator gets a little cooler, so areas previously very
cold become warmer. As the bulk of the exposed land mass (above sea level) is
north and south of the equator, as these areas become more exposed to
sunlight, they become warmer.  
• Man’s contribution is slight, but significant, because the polluting gases
act as “thermal” blankets and insulate the earth, thus heat on the cold areas
cannot readily escape into space, and therefore the heat gained from the sun
is trapped, further increasing temperatures.  
• In the scale of things, it takes a minute unbalance to affect climate. For
example, clouds rubbing together cause static build up, sufficient to cause
lightning. This in turn causes fires to start, but also causes the formation
of nitrous compounds, essential for plant growth. The fires emit huge
quantities of Co2, much more than man is causing, yet the growing plants
absorb much of this Co2. So the question is by how much are we unbalancing the
delicate environment. Simply, a small change in the natural balance as a
result of man’s activities can cause a huge change in overall climate, it’s
that sensitive.  
• As we head towards global warming, we will eventually head towards a future
ice age, over the titling axis cycle.  
All along we are assuming this fine balance will continue. Simple alterations
like a meteor hitting the earth, if large enough, can spell the end of life as
we know it. If it wasn’t for the outer planets attracting these outer space
bodies, earth couldn’t exist. Even a meteor hitting the moon, can unbalance
it’s relation to earth, it can affect the tides for one, or cause a slight
change to the earth’s tilt. If you think this is preposterous, just look at
the moon surface and see how many meteorites have crashed on the surface in
the past.  
The whole purpose of life is to maintain this balance, and not to do anything
to upset it.

Actually, ice cores taken from Greenland show that we were already heading
towards another ice age. But the cycles that had repeated over many hundreds
of thousands of years changed "recently". These changes have an amazing
correlation with human activities, such as the spread of agriculture, the
industrial revolution, and the modern era of petroleum usage.

Man's activities have had a very large and very profound change on the
climate.

The increase of carbon dioxide have also had a profound change on the oceans,
where carbonic acid is being produced as a result of increased carbon dioxide
absorption. Man's activities have now had a profound impact on the ability of
the oceans to support life.

Dear Asian contributor.

Not exactly sure what your comment above means. Did you want to say:
"Excellent, intuitive insight, careful analysis of detail, and the foresight
to foresee issues likely to affect all people in the future".

Then my answer would be "Yes".

Cheers, Joe

Check out the composition of our air. Carbon dioxide is 0.039% not 0.39%
(397ppmv). Nature herself does a wonderful job using CO2. Aren't shells
wonderful, where do you think carbonates (cement ingredients) came from? Dont
wonder about the values - what are you doing yourself to limit your excesses
now!

Carbon dioxide is to green side of life what oxygen is to humans and oxygen
breathing animals. It is not a pollutant. it is the life breath of plant. In
the past it has been incorrectly blamed for adverse climate changes. New

I think everyone should be put to death at a certain age like 30. we could
say, put to Sleep, we could have chambers where they could give them selves
up, and have ceremonies extolling their decision. We could employ other guys
to help them find their way if they should fail to show up, or run, we'll call
them sand men, to help the old give up their life so the planet could
continue.

The Greenhouse effect has nothing to do with how a greenhouse works. A
greenhouse prevents loss of heat by preventing convection. Our atmosphere does
not prevent convection. The Greenhouse effect is best described as radiative
forcing caused by the absorption of infrared radiation from the earth. A
better analogy, IMHO, would be that the Greenhouse effect is like a radiator
used to heat a house. It certainly does not stop convection but radiates the
heat it absorbed.

Next week, Mr. Wizard will explain the silly idea of trying to calculate an
average global mean temperature with an accuracy of 3 decimal places. That is
as easy as calculating the average world phone number and just as useful. 🙂

Here are some basics of thermodynamics For a start, a green house (or
polyhouse as we know it) works on the principle of the sun's radiation heating
plants and trapping of the absorbed heat as the re-radiation outwards is
blocked to a large extent by the inward reflection by the translucent poly
film. Nothing to do with convection or conduction for that matter. Convection
only matters if there was no poly house cover at all.

The same happens on the world scale. The sun's radiation heats the earth's
surface during the day, and as the earth gives up its heat at night, this
radiated heat is partially blocked by the minute pollution particles in the
air, that is, acting as the translucent 'poly' film of greenhouses. It's like
a giant insulating blanket around the earth. As the air around the earth is
bonded to the earth by the earth's gravity, heat can never be transferred by
convection beyond the earth's air film, around 30 Km thick.

The total net heat gain/loss to outer space is purely by radiation. In your
analogy, to correct your confused mixing of radiated and convected heat, a
house radiator is heated from within (by hot water or oil) and the heat is
radiated out to the cooler outer air in the room. Also, at the radiator
surface, air in contact becomes hot by conduction and as hot air rises,
convection currents are set up, cooler air replacing the rising hot air, and
the cycle repeats.

To clarify, here are some basic facts of thermodynamics.

            1. Heat moves from a hot area to a cold area via three transfer possibilities. Radiation - no transfer medium required, the denser the material the less radiation is transmitted. Convection - requires a medium (gas or liquid) that has absorbed heat moving from a hot area to a colder one. Conduction - requires a medium, usually a solid, and the more metallic, the better the conduction, viz., gold, silver copper.

            2. Radiation is the only way heat can transfer through a vacuum, as in outer space. No medium is required.

            3. Heat transferred by convection or conduction remains earth bound, and thus cannot be lost to outer space. If radiation is blocked by the earth's air blanket, that is reflected back to earth, then the earth will gradually warm so long as the sun shines.

            4. This reflectance of heat back to earth means the more we place reflective particles in the air, the more heat we retain, and the rate of heat trapped increases at an increasing rate.

            5. It will take many billions of years before the sun collapses on itself and stops shining, so this way out of human control. The only way we can control our own heating cycle, is to allow loss of heat to space. If we gain 100 units of heat, we need to lose almost 99.99999 units of heat to space, so that we warm slowly over many thousands of years, not a few hundred. If we keep adding to the reflective air layer, we will retain more heat, enough to melt all our ice caps, and flood the earth. Beyond this, we will eventually boil the oceans, and of course, all fluids will also boil, including human blood, so we will become extinct well before this happens.

The message is clear. We must allow our trapped heat to escape to space. That
means no green house cover.

In both the greenhouse effect and an actual greenhouse, there are
similarities. Sunlight is allowed to pass through the greenhouse covering or
atmosphere relatively unimpeded. And in both cases, the sunlight is converted
into heat.

But in the atmospheric greenhouse effect, the earth warms because the solar
energy is re-radiated back towards the earth by the greenhouse gases.

While in a greenhouse, the warming of the interior is simply a result of the
heat energy from the sunlight heating the air. The covering of the greenhouse
prevents the heated air from escaping the house "Convection". And since the
air is trapped inside as additional solar radiation continues to stream into
the greenhouse, the air gradually becomes warmer and warmer.

So on one hand (the atmosphere), it’s the energy itself that is re-radiated
and prevented from escaping, and on the other hand (an actual greenhouse) air
that has been warmed by the energy is prevented from escaping.

Splitting hairs? Perhaps. But apparently not as far as physicists are
concerned! (And I am most certainly NOT a physicist!)

Sorry, but we are not splitting hairs. What you state is blatantly wrong, and
thermodynamic physics will bear me out. I will point out the errors.

Quote: " And in both cases, the sunlight is converted into heat. "

Answer: No. The sunlight infra-red spectrum is already a heat energy radiation
and thus cannot be converted into heat. (It's already heat).

Quote: " While in a greenhouse, the warming of the interior is simply a result
of the heat energy from the sunlight heating the air.

Answer: Mostly wrong! The radiated infra red spectrum heat waves from the sun
that permeate through the poly film, heat any absorbing surface: (Graduated
from black to white or silver), so the black pots, blackish soil heat first,
then the stalks then the green leaves. The air in the green house is a distant
last, (mainly because its transparent and colourless in context). This heat
given off by the warm plants of course heats the air, and yes, convection
currents are set up, but these in themselves do not increase or trap heat
energy. If you opened the doors, the hot air will escape. Note however, the
primary heat source is actually the heat absorbing plants, not the air around
them.

Quote " So on one hand (the atmosphere), it’s the energy itself that is re-
radiated and prevented from escaping, and on the other hand (an actual
greenhouse) air that has been warmed by the energy is prevented from escaping.
"

Wrong again. These may be subtle differences, but here is how it works.

During the day, heat radiation from the sun (and I mean air or no air in
between) permeates through the earth's atmosphere as infra red heat energy to
hit the most heat absorbing surfaces, from black to white. Thus black rock,
then seas, then deserts, heat up in proportion to the absorbed energy.
Everything else in-between heats up in proportion to colour. This is the
heating phase, and while the heat energy transmitted by radiation is
maintained, objects will continue to absorb heat. They can only absorb heat
energy while the radiation is transmitting from the sun and the temperature of
the net energy transmitted exceeds that of the absorbing object.

Once the sun goes into shadow (night time) as the earth rotates, the heated
objects: like mountains, green areas, seas, deserts etc., are now hotter than
the outside air temperature, so they give up their heat to warm the
surrounding air. Convection does occur, and of course this produces the severe
weather like cyclones etc., but this is not the problem, although to humans
cyclones are no mean thing to contend with. The heat is primarily radiated out
to space. When the air blanket around the earth prevents this heat from
escaping by reflecting back some of the radiation, we then start to heat the
whole earth. As trapped heat is thus maintained, extra heat by constant
radiation can only get worse. Thus we have global warming.

The buffoon sceptics and deniers like our Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who
understand nothing about basic science, let alone thermodynamics, should be
sent to La La land, where his imagination can run riot and no one pulls the
idiot up. All he can see is promoting his rich fossil fuel friends. He is not
even sure his own grandchildren will suffer any damage. Can someone gently tap
him on the shoulder and see him out the door? Please.

The sun is producing billions of watts of energy, and even if we are far away,
the energy is relatively constant (during the day of course), so we should tap
into this free source of energy.

What's that, did someone say free!

If this was the case, how can exploiters make money by selling our fossil
fuels to unsuspecting consumers. There cannot be something free if exploiters
can't make a profit. Mind you, exploiters don't own the fossil fuels, that
belongs to the inhabitants, they just dig it up and sell it at a premium. So
the smart bastards manipulating fossil fuels maintain their richness. Good
one, dickhead governments!

The problems of capturing heat energy, storing it and then making it available
at a fraction of the cost of fossil fuels is not beyond us. Someone needs the
guts to till people like Abbott to pull his head in and let the rest of us get
on with life and changing technology.

Food for thought,

Your thinking here is completely wrong. Breathing is carbon neutral -- we
breathe in CO2 that's in the air, then we exhale it, with some added carbon
from the plants we eat, or the animals we eat who eat plants. The plants take
up CO2.

Breathing merely recycles carbon, it doesn't create it.

This is why global CO2 levels were essentially constant for millennia before
the Industrial Revolution, despite lots of people and animals breathing.

We are not talking about humans or animals or even plants upsetting the fine
balance of the earth's gases. We are talking about positive generation of Co2
by fossil fuel burning industries. I've yet to hear of an industry reabsorbing
the Co2 it produces.

In response to Duda's comment re series of connected events, Dinosaurs, are
animals, and breathe all the earth's gases exactly as humans do, so they won't
survive more than humans will. It wasn't the low Co2 that killed them, it was
the catastrophic change in climate, air gas ratios, temperature and dying out
of vegetation caused by a massive meteorite hitting the earth several million
years ago. Upset the food chain, and whole species become extinct.

By the way, I should have mentioned, although the Co2 exhaled and ingested is
finely balanced between the sea, humans and plants and is basically recycled.

The digestive gases by humans and animals is unbalanced, because these gases
are primarily methane, another gas more dangerous than Co2.

Not much on earth absorbs methane, so we could fart our way to distinction.
So, everyone: stop farting!

Here is a bone I'm throwing to the sceptics who say gases in our atmosphere
don't cause global warming. Let's accept man did land on the moon in 1969.

The moon has little or no atmosphere. Why? (Gravity is 1/6th that of earth's).
Maybe the gravitational pull couldn't keep any gases bound to the moon's
surface, like it does on Earth. On earth , air weighs approximately 6.7 Kgm
per 6.25 sq. cm., let's say 1 Kgm per sq. cm. All this saying is that air
around earth is going nowhere soon and certainly not to outer space.

Because the moon has a dark side that doesn't see the sun during lunar phases,
it gets very cold. The side lit by the sun gets very hot. The cold side cannot
give off any radiated heat. The hot side can and does radiate heat out to
space because there is no air. The overall temperature reaches a balance point
over time. The point is if the moon had our atmosphere, the loss of heat to
space would be reduced, and the moon would gain heat over a long period. But
over millions of years it hasn't, because it has no atmosphere.

The air "blanket" around earth has protected us so far from extremes of heat
and cold, though this is cyclical and depends on the planar alignment of the
earth's axis in relation to the planar rotational orbit around the sun. We are
almost at the end of the heating cycle and in a few thousand years, the
earth's axis will tilt back from 27.5 degrees off "vertical" back towards near
"vertical", causing the two ice poles to move towards the "top" and "bottom"
of our planet. The sun will heat a narrow band of the near horizontal plane of
the equator to scorching heat, but the polar ice caps will be so cold, we will
generally freeze over three quarters of the earth's surface. Strangely, we
might wish we had a thicker or denser air blanket to protect us from freezing
to death. So the sceptics will be correct in one sense, the earth will
actually cool, but not so much because of increased pollution, but because the
earth's axis "wobble".

In the next thousand years or so, we will however, feel the increase in
temperature before the cooling cycle kicks in.

So what is the solution.? On the one hand, the sceptics are right in that the
increase in temperature will take hundreds of years. But should they ignore
the harm that will be done to our future generations? The human body evolved
over a few hundred thousand years to breathe the air with gases in their
present ratios. We don't have the luxury to change our body mechanisms to cope
if these ratios change in a few hundred years. On top of that, we will be
breathing in the sub-size particles that will coat our lungs, causing
emphysema and other nasty breathing diseases.

Think this is hogwash? Try flying Melbourne to Shanghai and spend a few weeks
there, there is a background smell of noxious gases in the air. Then to really
experience pollution, fly to Beijing, but take eye drops, mouth guards and
respiratory capsules, and forget about seeing a blue sky or even one star in
the sky at night.

No wonder the Chinese people are emigrating to all parts of the world. They
can't breath properly in most of the big Chinese cities. In any case, why
should we accept this pollution, just because it's cheaper than free energy?
If we put our minds to it, we can generate cheap and almost free electricity
for the rest of time.

Before the massive coal stations were built, governments had to invest heavily
to build these monsters, but soon they produced cheap electricity as there was
no alternative. You dig up all the coal that has trapped millions of years of
carbon products and derivatives, burn it, and pump the oxidised gases (yes we
use up oxygen to burn fossil fuels to produce the oxidised derivatives Co2 and
Co, So2, Hso3, Hso4 and whatever else harmful to man) it into our finite and
encasing atmosphere, then wait another billion years for it to be reabsorbed
back as coal.

Are we that stupid? Seems so, especially when there is a motive of profit
driving cheap fossil fuels. Everyone says, while I make money, pollution is
not my problem. "Dawwh" , I think cavemen had more sense. To argue the case
that pollution has no effect on global warming for the sake of debate and
argument and ignoring simple physics, is not just folly, it's criminal for our
unborn generations to come.

CO2 emissions from exhaling (respiring) doesn't increase CO2 in the atmosphere
over time only when the population is constant.  
However, we can't add 6 million people to the planet in <100 years and then
omit to factor in the CO2 emissions from respiration. The CO2 that we exhale
can only come from carbon previously sequestered by photosynthetic plants in
the biosphere, so we've effectively replaced photosynthetic biomass with
respiring biomass. We then compound the problem by removing forests through
fire and land clearing, all of which ends up in the atmosphere through
combustion or decay.

Even without fossil fuel combustion we would still be causing AGW, albeit at a
slower rate.

Well said. You never hear Global Warming alarmists stating this because it is
politically incorrect. The real problem is "us" humans. Our respiration and
consumption or resources is adding to the overall amount of CO2 (and other
greenhouse gasses). The bigger question is, "Will the earth "self-balance" or
will the ecosystems destabilize?" We always see straight line projections
(CO2, population, etc.) but in real life nothing moves in straight lines. If
ecosystems destabilize food production will drop and population will
eventually drop through competition for resources (better know as war).
'Watched a not so great movie the other night (Kingsman) and Samuel L. Jackson
played the crazy evil guy that said the same thing as a lot of people in this
blog "humans are the problem" and he was going to rid the Earth of the
majority of humans thus saving the Earth from human "virus".

How is this going to play out in the next 50-100 years? I don't think we
should just ignore the fact that human existence does have some impact on the
climate of the earth; and we should strive to minimize that effect, but earth
is such a complex system affected by the varying energy input from our sun and
the billions of things in the ecosystem inputting or subtracting greenhouse
gasses. It's just very hard to know what is causing what?

Stupid, Stupid philosophy.

Exhaled C02 in the atmosphere does increase, even if the population
stabilizes, or decreases. The oceans and trees can only absorb so much. You
see, you "non alarmists" know nothing about basic physics.

Why; because we live on a planet that has gravity (as all other non
terrestrial bodies have). If you knew any basic science any third grader would
tell you, C02 has mass and therefore bound to the earth by gravity. Therefore,
any c02 not absorbed by natural means, stays bound to the earth.

Co2 weighs more than air, that is it has more mass, so it stays low to the
ground. Even when mixed by strong winds, it is still bound to the earth.

Therefore any C02 not absorbed naturally, stays in the air and low to the
ground. Now it's fundamentally easy to prove c02 is a poor conductor of heat
Basic thermodynamics will tell you, if you trap heat, you form a thermodynamic
blanket, and the temperature of the earth surrounded by this blanket will get
hotter. The sun doesn't stop shining for at least another 3-4 billion years,
and it's rays heat the earth continuously and consistently. This heat must
dissipate out to space. Not if we have a blanket around the earth

So we will experience increased temperatures every year from now on for the
next thousand years. We are not taking into account the tilt of the earths
axis or the earth's wobble. That's another story and has 25,000 year cycles.

For the here and now, stop the stupid bullsh*t: we are not warming, and you
must accept basic science, or you become the greatest morons known to man.
Like our stupid ex prime minister who only considers big business selling
fossil fuels. No wonder he was chucked out.

Exactly what I was looking for. In my research I also learnt that the level of
carbon dioxide  
humans breathe out is consumed by plants and trees who in return give out
oxygen in the environment and the cycle is balanced in harmony. Hence chopping
down trees not just reduces the chances of lowering oxygen levels for us to
breathe in but also there will be lesser trees to consume the carbon dioxide
we humans breathe out and then we can say that we are on the verge of being
responsible for the increasing levels of co2 just by breathing.

Some "scientists" say that humans do not contribute to the CO2 problem by
exhaling it since the CO2 is part of the "close cycle" ( we are consuming
carbon that is in the food already and returning it back by exhaling) … Well
there's a "renewable energy" power plant in east TX. It burns refuse wood from
a paper mill.. It's "renewable" since it returns the same carbon that was
already contained in tree bark and such, hence: 0 emissions… "Renewable power
plant" On the same token, all natural gas and coal burners are "renewable" as
well since they are recycling the carbon that it was ALWAYS there! Hmmm .. I
guess you can always add some ideology to your environmental, global warming
"theories" as long you like the final answer…

Hi George,

Interesting proposition you propose. You miss one tiny tiny detail, blind
Freddie could have seen, and he wasn't a scientist. All solid and liquid state
carbon, ie., contained in liquid form, oil, petrol etc., and solid form,
trees, carbon etc.,are relatively harmless, even when dug up.

However, once they are turned into gaseous forms, by applying oxygen and heat
and produce the carbon monoxides, carbon dioxide and carbon trioxides, then
they become very very dangerous to breath in (monoxide gas will kill you in
two minutes) and contribute to global warming as the Co2 is an insulator.

It's not ideology but simple fact. Even I can make this statement drawing on
my chemistry lessons of 60 years ago. So please, if you want reasoned debate,
don't speak so much crap!

You missed the point entirely. It's the carbon gases, not the liquid or solid
forms.

Well I don’t know what to make of some of the discussions on this blog. People
of “Green Nazi” persuasion generally use snippets of science to try to prove
their point.  
First I will say for the record I am not a Greenie. Point one because a fuel
is renewable (trees grow back) it does not mean it does not emit pollutant gas
and particulate when burned. So moron “green” minded individuals that think
the renewable label makes something green and good and desirable are woefully
ignorant. Burning wood emits just as much carbon, (CO, CO2) and is only better
than coal because coal emits some metals and Sulfur oxides not contained in
wood. Those pollutants cause acid rain and lung irritants. Things the western
world learned in the 70’s.  
The point of this blog it seems should be about equilibrium conditions of our
atmosphere and weather it can effectively absorb the extremely small
percentage of carbon that mankind burning anything made from carbon emits.
What the un-informed fail to take into consideration is how efficiently one
can burn one form of fuel compared to others. Efficiencies in extracting
energy from the available fuels is the answer and the direction our science
should be leading.  
Solar cells have been in existence since 1954 they have improved in efficiency
from 6% to 19% for economical non exotic ($$$$$) cell technology. To power the
city of Los Angeles we would need to cover the entire state of Arizona, not a
viable solution. Heat energy Solar plants cover vast areas of land to recover
small quantities of power they are more efficient than photovoltaic because
they use a higher % of the Photon energy. Wind is viable but expensive and
ugly and unreliable.  
Until there is real un-socialist-slanted science that is able to cooperate on
development of all the improvement in all the energy technologies available,
there will be no improvement on the world carbon footprint.  
The obvious alternative is Nuclear power the only potential solution to the
entire 100% of the footprint is completely ignored by the numb brained
Greenies. No I do not propose nuclear automobiles. But Nuclear power can be
used to create H2 and O2 the H2 can power automobiles. Don’t even say the word
Hindenburg. It is a solution. ZERO CARBON. The socialists are against Nuclear
power also. They want control of the politics of the atmosphere so they can
command the masses and live in their Ivory towers.  
Do I believe it is possible for us to contribute to the greenhouse gasses in a
meaningful percentage? Not without actually trying.  
Math is a part of the solution but nowhere on this blog is there a calculation
of the volume of the earth’s atmosphere. Or a calculation of the volume of
emissions from burning one gallon of gasoline X the average mileage of the
average vehicle x the number of vehicles and dividing the total volume of
those emissions by the volume of the atmosphere. .00000something I bet. Hey I
have not done the calculation either. To my thinking the lions share of the
data for “proof” warming exists is suspect and the socialists have shutdown
further data gathering because “It is settled Science”. Be skeptical, very
skeptical.

But the CO2 emission by human breathing is from renewable source , so it does
not increase atmospheric CO2 level at all.

Plants build atmospheric carbon from CO2 into their bodies , so it decreases
CO2 level in air, then we eat the plant or the animal that has eaten the plant
,our bodies burn the carbon and we breathe it back into the atmosphere in the
form of CO2.

So our breathing is just circulation of carbon without changing the global
atmospheric CO2 level.

Global CO2 level only increases in the following cases:

            1. we burn fossil energy sources (oil, gas or coal) that have been burried deep underground. 
            2. we decrease the quantity of global biomass, so all the carbon trapped in the plants and animals will go to the atmosphere . It can happen either quickly, by burning ,or slowly , when fungi and other microorganisms decompose the body of the dead animal or plant, so all the carbon turns into CO2 and goes into the atmosphere.

Guys, ALL carbon manipulations are part of a closed system. There are X carbon
atoms associated with the planetary system, and that's not changing in any
way. All the various things are just shuffling those carbon atoms around.

The only real argument you can is that with fossil fuels we're taken carbon
that had been effectively "locked away" underground and re-introducing it to
the atmosphere. We assume it got there in the first plae in some fashion, a
long time ago, and there's no reason to think those processes no longer occur,
so carbon would be going back to those locked away places at some rate too.
But that's probably a much smaller rate than the rate at which we're unlocking
them.

So to talk intelligently about this you have to factor in the transfer rates
of ALL of the processes. To whatever extent we're accelerating an "unlocking"
process over what it would otherwise be, yes, we're going to shift the balance
of carbon in the various repositories.

I assume the general amount of carbon in my body is relatively stable; it
seems reasonable to say that once a human stops growing they cease being a net
carbon sink. So while it's true that all of us are breathing CO2 out al lthe
time, it's also true that we are consuming carbon (when we eat) and that the
net balance is zero. This would apply to all elements - a grown human being is
a chemically static entity. We take stuff in, process it to liberate energy,
and put the results back out.

Some sea life uses carbon to build shells, and when they die those shells can
fall to the ocean floor and stay there for a long time. That carbon might be
locked away long enough to consider that a real sink over the time periods
climate folk tend to discuss. That's the same sort of process that led to the
underground trapping of what eventually became fossil fuels in the first
place.

Ultimately this is all about _energy_. Carbon compounds exist which are
effective stores of energy, and we use that energy to survive (not just to
warm ourselves and move ourselves around, but also to eat). The only net
energy input in all of this is photosynthesis.

Lets consider what would happen if 7 billion people suddenly appeared on the
planet. This isn't such a silly proposition given that the worlds population
was 1 billion 200 years ago, and 200 years is a mere blip on geological time
scales.

Now, suddenly, with 7 billion people, those people need to consume food from
the biosphere, which means eating lots of plants, and of course, plants
produce O2 from CO2 during photosynthesis and store carbon.

Unlike plants, humans store a very small amount of carbon (mostly water) and
unlike plants we convert O2 into CO2.

With 7 billion people emitting about 2.5Gt CO2 per year that wasn't previously
being emitted we need to rely on the biosphere being able to sink 2.5Gt CO2
per annum more than it was before, which of course is impossible, because the
biosphere was / is already in a state of equilibrium.

Fortunately the higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere does increase the rate
of photosynthesis slightly but nonetheless there's still a net accumulation of
CO2 in the atmosphere because trees and vegetation can only store (sink) about
50% of those human emissions (from best measurements), and inevitably with a
population of 7 billion humans there's now less plants and trees to sink
carbon. Worse still is the fact that trees have been burnt and felled to make
way for human settlement and food crops.

It's theoretically possible to almost double atmospheric CO2 levels simply by
burning every plant in the biosphere, and assuming that was done it would take
the biosphere about 1200 years to sink the same amount of carbon back into
photosynthetic trees and plants.

Of course this does overlook an important external carbon sink; namely the
ocean. Without considering the ocean as a carbon sink our CO2 emissions from
humans breathing would cause atmospheric CO2 levels to double within about 60
years. But even with the presence of an ocean, CO2 levels in the atmosphere
must continue to rise slowly.

Using simplistic assumptions, even if the population used 100% renewable
energy, the potential of the biosphere to sink CO2 from the atmosphere does
limit human population to about 3 billion based purely on the added component
of human respiration and assuming infinite sustainability.

So yes, we do all contribute to the GHE by simply breathing, but it would
probably take 1000 years before it led to significant climate change, instead

The proof that you are wrong is that satellite photography has shown that
plant life is blooming and greening the Earth. Did you note that 2016 was an
all-time record for world grain production? Life will be better for everyone
when CO2 hits 2,000PPM.

Hello micpohling!

About 10 yrs ago, I came up with the same question for human C02 output!

Found your calcs on the internet which are far more mathematical than my rough
stab.

Your maths was only for normal breathing. My question is what about all the
fitness fanatics. The daily joggers, marathon runners (millions world wide),
cyclists, athletes (amateur and professional), etc., etc.?

Your calcs show outputs of approx. 9 and 5.7% of man's C02 output. If the
world got itself together and agreed that everyone on the planet (babies
excluded!) Held their breath for one minute, say, 10 times a day - well, there
has to be a saving there surely. Every little bit helps!

The reason I have only ever discussed thus with a couple of close friends for
fun, is that there is a sinister side. A country's government or regime could
easily come up with a human C02 tax. Check the capacity of each individual,
calculate their output over a year and hey presto - a measureable taxable
money maker! Of course, if your lifestyle is more energetic, active or sporty,
then the more tax you pay. Simple! I say sinister as polititians are not
generally clever nowadays. So it would only take one scientific paper to point
out to them and for them to realise the potential. Their eyes would turn into
the proverbial $ or £ signs!

Just a rambling thought train!

Cheers, Jon Stockwell

Nonsense.

Humans, like all animals, are carbon neutral. The CO2 we produce was just
recently taken out of the atmosphere by the plants we ate or the plants that
the animals we eat, ate.

CO2 from fossil fuels was taken out of the atmosphere millions of years ago
and over much longer periods than the time we take to put it back in the
atmosphere.

That's why CO2 concentrations are going up.

This provides an invaluable service to life on land, especially in mitigating
some of the effects of human driven climate change. In addition, microscopic
plants, called phytoplankton produce between half to 70% of all oxygen. To put
this into perspective, researchers have tried to calculate how much oxygen

You exhale ~ 250 ml of CO2 a breath! not a minute. Exhaled minute tidal volume
is around 8-14 liters of CO2 per minute.

CLIMATE DRIFT was its name, before the politicians dumbed it down. It started
when the molten blob cooled enough to have a climate. It drifted enough to
have, it is thought, to have 5 major Ice Ages, interspersed with 4 Warm Ages,
plus the last one now. At times there would have been very little water vapour
or CO2. At other times lots, to make trees. Hence all the coal. Don't bother
with short timescales. Life's too short.

Like I keep repeating, the major cause of climate change is the way the
earth’s axis tilts by about 25 Deg.as the earth wobbles its trajectory around
the sun. It”s simple science. Point the equator towards the sun more directly
(when the relative vertical axis is closer to 90 Deg to the equator) and it
gets hotter than the poles. When the axis tilt (to maximum 25 Deg) away from
vertical, the poles get more exposure to the sun, hence ice melts in the
Arctic and more freezing occurs in the Antarctic. After several thousands of
years, this process is reversed. Thus we have periodic ice ages and have had
them since water formed on earth..  
However, despite this unavoidable change in climate, pollution levels which
increase Co2 in the atmosphere, also affect spot areas on earth, as the winds
move this insulating “blanket” over land and sea. Thus we have severe cold
spots (viz Europe at present) and ever increasing hot spots (viz Australia).
In other words, pollution magnifies the natural process of cooling and heating
of the earth.

On top of all this, The global earth moves in oval trajectory around the sun ,
and comes close to the sun and away from the sun in one elliptical cycle once
every year. Thus we have alternating seasons. Hot, medium, cold, medium and
back to hot (read summer, autumn, winter, spring and back to summer.

Man’s interference by doing things like cutting down trees, over fishing,
increasing Co2 levels, polluting rivers, creeks and sea, only makes matters
worse and upsets the fine equilibrium our precious earth possess.

Another little known impact on the earth’s “wobble” is the increasing number
of major movements by man on the earth’s surface. For a ship of several
hundred thousand tons starting and stopping on it’s journey can affect (ever
so slightly) the earth’s rotation through action and reaction. Multiply this
by thousands of ships, trains and planes, if not millions and there might be a
case for a mathematician to examine this issue. If the earths single daily
rotation is increased or decreased, our day gets longer or shorter. Also, what
happens when we discharge a rocket of immense power. My mouth waters at this
man made phenomena.
