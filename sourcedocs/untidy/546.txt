HelpCenter FAQ

Human activities contribute to climate change by causing changes in Earth’s
atmosphere in the amounts of greenhouse gases, aerosols (small particles), and
cloudiness. The largest known contribution comes from the burning of fossil
fuels, which releases carbon dioxide gas to the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases and aerosols affect climate by altering incoming solar
radiation and out-going infrared (thermal) radiation that are part of Earth’s
energy balance. Changing the atmospheric abundance or properties of these
gases and particles can lead to a warming or cooling of the climate system.

Since the start of the industrial era (about 1750), the overall effect of
human activities on climate has been a warming influence. The human impact on
climate during this era greatly exceeds that due to known changes in natural
processes, such as solar changes and volcanic eruptions.
