# What Does Weed Cost? The Complete Weed Price Breakdown

![What Does Weed Cost](https://z3akv3i7gv-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-

content/uploads/2017/06/weed_prices_1.jpg)

For the longest time, marijuana was an under-the-table commodity. It was
talked about in hushed tones and exchanged discreetly so as to avoid
detection.

During those dark days, weed prices were largely dependent on the whims of the
person doing the selling. There was no online infographic explaining what weed
costs. You just paid what “your guy” asked because you didn’t know where else
to go.

Thankfully, those days are gone forever and the market has completely changed.
Not too far in the future, we’re likely to see a major company that grows or
sells marijuana traded on the stock market.

Ganja is now discussed openly by everyone from big-name financiers to the
average joe on the internet. In some states, you can even walk into a corner
store and purchase a bit of wacky tabacky for the weekend…legally.

That’s all well and good, but the age-old question still remains: How do you
know if you’re paying too much for a date with Mary Jane? Don’t fret! The
experts at Honest Marijuana are here to help. We’ve done the research and
gathered all the information in one place so you don’t have to spend hours
looking for the best deal.

In this article, we’ll compare weed prices across the country so you know what
the going rate is in your area. We’ll also give you some insight into what
affects the price of weed in your state and around the country.

To help you find the information you’re looking for, we’ve categorized the
pricing based on the most common quantities of cannabis: gram, eighth,
quarter, half, ounce. These are the divisions used by dispensaries from Maine
to Florida and Massachusetts to California. All you have to do is walk in and
say, “Give me a gram please,” and you’ll be on your way to flying in your very
own Blue Dream.

## Price Per Quantity

In the sections below, we’ll give you an average price for all the states
where medical and/or recreational marijuana is legal.

Currently, 29 states and the District of Columbia (a.k.a. Washington D.C.,
which isn’t technically a state) have passed laws legalizing or
decriminalizing medical and/or recreational marijuana.

Those states include:

  * Alaska
  * Arizona
  * Arkansas
  * California
  * Colorado
  * Connecticut
  * Delaware
  * Florida
  * Hawaii
  * Illinois
  * Maine
  * Maryland
  * Massachusetts
  * Michigan
  * Minnesota
  * Montana
  * Nevada
  * New Hampshire
  * New Jersey
  * New Mexico
  * New York
  * North Dakota
  * Ohio
  * Oregon
  * Pennsylvania
  * Rhode Island
  * Vermont
  * Washington
  * Washington, DC
  * West Virginia

Prices in states where medical or recreational marijuana isn’t legal could
vary considerably from this list. Also, keep in mind that the prices listed
here are for medium-quality weed. High-quality weed will cost more while low-
quality weed will cost less.

These are also just averages. Smaller quantities will likely cost more than
larger quantities. It’s also important to remember that a lot goes into
pricing marijuana for sale. We’ll delve into this toward the end of the
article. But for now, remember that actual prices in your state may vary.

For example, if the price listed here for a gram of weed is $10 or $11, it
wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility that your local dispensary might
charge $15. But when prices start approaching $20 or more for that same gram
of ganja, you have some inkling that it isn’t a good deal.

That said, use this guide as a frame of reference, not as the bottom line,
this-is-what-I’m-going-to-pay-or-else number. OK? Let’s get started!

### Gram: Price Per Gram Of Weed

![Cost Per Gram Of Weed](https://z3akv3i7gv-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-

The gram is the base unit for measuring marijuana. Technically speaking, it’s
a metric unit of mass equal to one-thousandth of a kilogram. Unfortunately,
somewhere along the line, someone decided to measure weed in larger quantities
based on the ounce.

The ounce is a unit of weight roughly equal to one-sixteenth of a pound. So
when you’re measuring cannabis, you’re mixing metric and Imperial units. It’s
unfortunate, but it’s the way of the marijuana world, so get used to it. But
back to the gram…

As you’ll see as we go along, the various ounce measurements are based on
grams, so it’s useful to know the price for this small quantity.

A great visual reference for a gram is the bottle cap. The size of one bottle
cap is roughly equivalent to one gram of marijuana. We say “roughly” because
the density of the bud can vary. Because of this variation, the size of one
gram can change. But for comparison purposes, the bottle cap makes a good
frame of reference.

Another great way to gauge these common quantities is by how many joints they
yield. This is by no means an exact science, but your average joint weighs in
at 0.7 grams of marijuana. Basically, then, a gram gives you 1.5 joints.
Again, this a very rough estimate.

As to the prices below, these are based on the average price for an ounce of
medium-quality weed. Actual prices in your area may range from $9-$15 a gram.

Alaska | $10.82

An eighth (of an ounce) is equal to 3.5 grams. With our bottle-cap comparison,
an eighth of an ounce of weed is roughly equivalent to three bottle caps. An
eighth will produce about five joints if rolled sparingly.

Blackrockog.com_

A quarter (of an ounce) is equal to 7 grams. On the visual scale, that’s about
seven bottle caps. Remember, it’s not an exact visual representation. It is,
however, a good approximation you can use to guesstimate the amount of weed
you’re getting.

A quarter of an ounce of MJ will produce about 10 joints rolled with 0.7 grams
each.

Alaska | $75.76

Blackrockog.com_

A half (of an ounce) is equal to 14 grams. You’ve probably figured out the
math by now, but just in case: a half an ounce of marijuana would likely yield
twenty joints.

Alaska | $151.52

An ounce is equal to 28 grams. A pile that weighs in at an ounce will be about
as large as twenty-eight bottle caps. This quantity of marijuana can produce
about forty joints.

Now that you’ve got an idea what weed costs in your state (or a state near
you), let’s delve into the factors that affect weed price. That way, you’ll
know why there’s such a difference between the price of marijuana in Montana
and the price of marijuana in North Dakota.

## Factors That Affect Weed Price

### Weed Prices By State

![](https://z3akv3i7gv-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-

content/uploads/2017/06/weed_prices_7.gif)_Source: _governing.com__

Where you live is probably the biggest factor affecting weed prices. And it’s
not just geography. It’s your state’s stand on legalization. In most places
where weed isn’t legal, dealers can go to jail for selling. Because of this,
their prices are often going to be higher in reflection of the risk.

Only eight states have legalized recreational marijuana use so far: Alaska,
California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.

We’re not counting Washington D.C. because, even though they’ve legalized
recreational and medical marijuana for adults, it’s still not legal to buy
there. Figure that one out.

The other twenty-one states have legalized medical marijuana use, which
requires a doctor’s recommendation to purchase. The nice thing is that more
states will be considering the question of legalization in upcoming ballots.
Should these initiatives pass, it will be much easier for more people across
the United States to purchase the green they need.

Looking a bit closer at geography, it’s easy to see why this factor can have a
large effect on the price you pay for the weed in your bong. Most weed is
grown in warmer climates with fairly stable daytime temperatures that range
from 75 to 86 ℉.

Temperatures above 88 ℉ and below 60 ℉ can decrease THC content and slow
growth. That means that ideal weed growing locations are few and far between.
The plant _can_ be grown in these less-than-ideal locations but the quality of
the strain will be affected.

What does all that mean to you, the consumer? It means that the weed you buy
has to be shipped in from somewhere else. Transportation has to be taken into
consideration, and that cost will be factored into the final price you pay for
your marijuana.

What does that look like, exactly? For starters, planes, trains, and
automobiles all run on gas, which costs money. Labor (which is also not free)
is needed to load, drive, and unload the product to its destination. The price
of fuel and labor is then included in the final price you pay. So, as you can
see, geography has a lot to do with the price you pay for your wacky weed.

### Where You Buy Weed

![Where To Buy Weed](https://z3akv3i7gv-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-

content/uploads/2016/08/What-Does-Weed-Cost_1-500x314.png)_Source:
azmarijuana.com_

Again, depending on where you live, you have two options: buying from an
individual “on the street” or buying from a registered dispensary or
storefront. Where you buy has a major effect on weed prices.

In states where the sale of marijuana is legal, registered dispensaries and
storefronts are typically cheaper than individuals selling on the street. The
nice thing is dispensaries are also more reputable. They have to follow strict
guidelines in the labeling and display of their product.

You’ll always know what you’re getting when you buy from a dispensary. The guy
on the street doesn’t have to follow those guidelines, so you never know
exactly what you might get into your dime bag.

For one thing, you might be paying a premium for what the guy on the street
claims is high-quality cannabis. In actuality, you could be getting the dregs
or leftovers (the shake). You wouldn’t want to pay $50 for something that’s
actually only worth maybe $8.

For another thing, not knowing what you’re getting when you purchase a drug
can be deadly. This is evident by the recent outbreak of overdoses caused by
carfentanil-laced heroin.

Carfentanil is an elephant tranquilizer that is between 5000 and 10,000 times
more powerful than morphine. The equivalent of a few grains of salt of
carfentanil can kill an adult human. Imagine that stuff showing up in your
eighth-ounce of Fruity Pebbles! It’s better to buy from a trusted source, like
a dispensary, and know what you’re getting than to buy from Joe Blow and risk
your life.

### Competition

![Cost Of Marijuana](https://z3akv3i7gv-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-

content/uploads/2016/08/What-Does-Weed-Cost_7-1-500x243.png)_Source:
curbed.com_

Depending on where you buy, competition may be another influential factor on
the price of weed. If there are multiple individuals or multiple dispensaries
selling in the same area, their competition for your business may cause them
to lower their prices. If no competition exists, dealers can charge more for
their product because it is a relatively scarce commodity.

A prime example of competition in action is two gas stations located on
opposite sides of the same street. To get you to pull up to their pumps, gas
station A may lower their price significantly for a few hours or an entire
day.

In response to gas station A’s price drop, gas station B may lower their
prices even more. If you’re a savvy consumer, you keep your eyes on their
signs and fill your tank with the gas that costs less.

The same “push-and-pull” reaction can happen between ganja dispensaries in the
same area. For example, dispensary A may lower the price of an eighth of
Cherry OG to pull consumers off the street. In response, dispensary B may
discount the price of a quarter of Sour Diesel.

If you know what you normally pay for these quantities — and if you’re not
picky about the strain — you can get a really great deal. All thanks to
competition and the effect it has on weed prices.

### Weed Taxes

![Taxes On Weed](https://z3akv3i7gv-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-

content/uploads/2016/08/What-Does-Weed-Cost_10-500x281.png)_Source: herb.co_

In states where marijuana is legal, the sale of the weed is always associated
with a tax or fee of some sort. Colorado, for example, includes a state tax
rate of 2.9% and a special marijuana sales tax of 10%.

And if that isn’t enough, Colorado then applies a local tax (usually 0.5% to
1%) that varies by location on every dollar spent. They also tack on a 15%
excise tax on every pound. This tax is paid by the wholesaler but can
certainly impact the cost you pay as the end user.

Just for reference, sales tax — the money tacked on to every purchase you make
— ranges from 1.69% to 9.45% in the United States. That means that you pay
anywhere from a penny to a dime extra per dollar for the things you buy.

Extending that to marijuana sales, in Colorado, you’ll pay almost $0.14 more
for every dollar you spend. So if you buy a half an ounce for $100.00, you’re
going to pay almost $14 in sales tax.

And even if the tax rate paid by you, the end user, is fairly low, there may
be taxes on production, transportation, and packaging (just to name a few)
that can have a dramatic effect on the final price of cannabis products in
your state.

As you can see, how much of a tax is charged at any point in the supply chain
can have a dramatic effect on the price you pay for your fix.

### Quality Of Weed

![quality of weed](https://z3akv3i7gv-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-

content/uploads/2016/08/What-Does-Weed-Cost_12-500x335.png)_Source:
cannador.com_

Quality is another major variable that affects weed prices. High-quality ganja
is obviously going to cost more than medium- or low-quality stuff. We’re all
familiar with this when it comes to gas for our car. Premium-grade gasoline
costs more than regular unleaded.

You may not have much control over the quality of the weed being sold in your
area, but when prices fluctuate from one week to the next for the same type
and quantity, quality may have a lot to do with it.

### When You Buy

Cannabis that’s grown outside is usually ready for harvest by September. In
the weeks and months following a successful harvest, prices may decrease as
the supply available increases.

If you’ve got the money to spend, buying a larger quantity once — instead of a
smaller quantity multiple times — may be a way to take advantage of the price
drop that comes with a supply increase.

Whether or not you choose to go that route depends on marijuana perishability
and preservation. If you can keep your cannabis fresh longer, you’re better
off buying in bulk when the time is right in order to save money.

### How Your Marijuana Is Grown

Another component that influences the price you pay for weed is how that weed
is grown. Cannabis that is grown outdoors is much less expensive to produce.
This is because light, water, soil, and temperature are regulated by nature
and don’t require a lot of extra money, time, and effort from the growers.

Indoor-grown cannabis, on the other hand, requires special lights, climate
control, watering, feeding, and the electricity that makes it all possible.
Maintaining and regulating these components can be very labor-intensive, not
to mention being expensive to set up and operate.

But while outdoor-grown marijuana may be less expensive to produce, indoor-
grown marijuana can be produced at a higher standard. This is because all the
elements that nature usually takes care of can be tweaked to perfection by man
and his technology.

Indoor-growers can isolate specific wavelengths of light to give the cannabis
plant the nourishment it needs. Indoor-growers can control the humidity and
precisely manage watering and fertilization. They can also almost completely
eliminate insects and other pests that plague the cannabis plant without the
need for pesticides.

That means you, the consumer, receive a healthier, natural product and don’t
have to worry about toxins in your marijuana. That premium on health and
safety can mean a big difference in price between organic, indoor-grown ganja
and the same strain of outdoor-grown cannabis.

## Putting It All Together

Though amounts may vary widely from state to state, and even city to city,
weed prices are beginning to approach some semblance of fair-market value. As
more and more states legalize recreational marijuana, more and more
storefronts will appear to sell it.

As the marijuana industry continues to grow, prices will eventually become
fairly consistent across the country. You’ll never pay the same everywhere you
go, but prices will be fairly consistent throughout the country. When that
time arrives, you’ll be able to know for sure, wherever you are, whether
you’re getting a good deal on the weed you need.
