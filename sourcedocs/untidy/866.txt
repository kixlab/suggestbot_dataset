The world is getting warmer. Whether the cause is human activity or natural
variability--and the preponderance of evidence says it's humans--thermometer
readings all around the world have risen steadily since the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution. (Click on bullets above to step through the decades.)

According to an ongoing temperature analysis conducted by scientists at NASA's
Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on
Earth has increased by about 0.8° Celsius (1.4° Fahrenheit) since 1880. Two-
thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly
0.15-0.20°C per decade.

But why should we care about one degree of warming? After all, the temperature
fluctuates by many degrees every day where we live.

The global temperature record represents an average over the entire surface of
the planet. The temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can
fluctuate significantly due to predictable cyclical events (night and day,
summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But
the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives
from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space--quantities that change
very little. The amount of energy radiated by the Earth depends significantly
on the chemical composition of the atmosphere, particularly the amount of
heat-trapping greenhouse gases.

A one-degree _global_ change is significant because it takes a vast amount of
heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a
one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little
Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America
under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.

The maps above show temperature anomalies, or changes, not absolute
temperature. They depict how much various regions of the world have warmed or
cooled when compared with a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface
air temperature for that period was estimated to be 14°C (57°F), with an
uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.) In other words, the maps show how
much warmer or colder a region is compared to the norm for that region from
1951-1980.

Global temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not
sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The period of
1951-1980 was chosen largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a
three-decade period to define "normal" or average temperature. The GISS
temperature analysis effort began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was
1951-1980. It is also a period when many of today's adults grew up, so it is a
common reference that many people can remember.

The line plot below shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2014 as
recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Japan Meteorological Agency, and the Met Office
Hadley Centre (United Kingdom). Though there are minor variations from year to
year, all four records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All
show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as
the warmest.

To conduct its analysis, GISS uses publicly available data from 6,300
meteorological stations around the world; ship- and buoy-based observations of
sea surface temperature; and Antarctic research station measurements. These
three data sets are loaded into a computer analysis program--available for
public download from the GISS web site--that calculates trends in temperature
anomalies relative to the average temperature for the same month during
1951-1980.

The objective, according to GISS scientists, is to provide an estimate of
temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate
change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in
solar activity.

As the maps show, global warming doesn't mean temperatures rose everywhere at
every time by one degree. Temperatures in a given year or decade might rise 5
degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. Exceptionally cold
winters in one region might be followed by exceptionally warm summers. Or a
cold winter in one area might be balanced by an extremely warm winter in
another part of the globe.

Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is
slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ
substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins. The graph below
shows the long-term temperature trends in relation to El Niño or La Niña
events, which can skew temperatures warmer or colder in any one year. Orange
bars represent global temperature anomalies in El Niño years, with the red
line showing the longer trend. Blue bars depict La Niña years, with a blue
line showing the trend. Neutral years are shown in gray, and the black line
shows the overall temperature trend since 1950.

![Annual Temperature vs

Average](/ContentWOC/images/decadaltemp/graph_gis_2014.png)

Since the year 2000, land temperature changes are 50 percent greater in the
United States than ocean temperature changes; two to three times greater in
Eurasia; and three to four times greater in the Arctic and the Antarctic
Peninsula. Warming of the ocean surface has been largest over the Arctic
Ocean, second largest over the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans, and third
largest over most of the Atlantic Ocean.

In the global maps at the top of this page, the years from 1885 to 1945 tend
to appear cooler (more blues than reds), growing less cool as we move toward
the 1950s. Decades within the base period do not appear particularly warm or
cold because they are the standard against which all decades are measured. The
leveling off between the 1940s and 1970s may be explained by natural
variability and possibly by cooling effects of aerosols generated by the rapid
economic growth after World War II.

Fossil fuel use also increased in the post-War era (5 percent per year),
boosting greenhouse gases. But aerosol cooling is more immediate, while
greenhouse gases accumulate slowly and take much longer to leave the
atmosphere. The strong warming trend of the past three decades likely reflects
a shift from comparable aerosol and greenhouse gas effects to a predominance
of greenhouse gases, as aerosols were curbed by pollution controls, according
to GISS director Jim Hansen.
