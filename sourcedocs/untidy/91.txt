# How Many Couples are Waiting to Adopt?

![](/shop_image/article/7e6a1a957bc02cbac1998ae1cb1dcfbb_lg.jpg)

If you are pregnant and considering adoption for your unborn baby, it will be
up to you to choose the perfect adoptive parents to raise your child. But, as
you scroll through the profiles of hundreds of families waiting to adopt, you
may feel overwhelmed by your options. _How will I find the perfect family
waiting to adopt? Are there many options out there for me? Just how many
families are looking to adopt?_

It is difficult to find reliable statistics to answer this question. Some
sources estimate that there are about 2 million couples currently waiting to
adopt in the United States -- which means there are as many as 36 waiting
families for every one child who is placed for adoption.

Consider this: about 10 percent of women in the United States -- 6.1 million
-- have difficulty getting or staying pregnant. While not all women facing
infertility will pursue adoption, a 2002 study by the Centers for Disease
Control shows that more than half (57 percent) of women who use infertility
services do consider adoption.

In addition, these numbers do not take into account how many parents want to
adopt for reasons other than infertility. Many more hopeful parents choose to
grow their families through adoption, whether they are unmarried individuals,
members of the LGBT community, or anyone else who feels that they are meant to
adopt. Still many other waiting families simply don't care whether a child is
biologically related to them or not, or wish to add another child through
adoption after already having conceived one or more of their own. There are
many types of waiting families for adoption.

And as society continues to become more aware and accepting of the diverse
types of families created through adoption, the number of waiting families for
adoption continues to rise.

In fact, according to the Donaldson Adoption Institute, about 81.5 million
Americans have considered adopting a child at one time in their lives. That's
about 40 percent of all U.S. adults, up from 36 percent in 1997. It's a
statistic that will likely continue to grow as more Americans understand how
beautiful adoption can be. While many of these people will not actually
complete the adoption process, these numbers clearly demonstrate that there
are a significant number of loving families who are interested in adoption.

### How Many People Want to Adopt a Baby with American Adoptions?

At any given time, American Adoptions is usually working with about 200 active
families who have been pre-screened and approved to adopt. These hopeful
parents come from all across the country, have many different backgrounds and
have many different reasons for choosing adoption, but it's important to know
that every family waiting to adopt through American Adoptions has undergone
financial, criminal and medical background checks, as well as interviews with
each family member and a home inspection. You will never see a prospective
adoptive family waiting to adopt through American Adoptions who cannot provide
a safe, secure and loving home for your baby.

It can be difficult to determine exactly how many families want to adopt at
any given time. Just know that if you are a pregnant woman considering
adoption, you will find the perfect adoptive parents for your child. With so
many people looking to adopt, you will have your choice of many wonderful,
loving families. And at American Adoptions, we can help you to find that one
family waiting to adopt that can give your child exactly the life you're
envisioning.

### Where Can I See Waiting Families' Profiles?

American Adoptions works with each family waiting to adopt to create two
different kinds of adoption profiles: a print profile and a video profile. It
can be overwhelming to realize how many families are waiting to adopt, but
these profiles give you a way to learn more about any given waiting family
prior to meeting them. Your adoption specialist will show you profiles of
different waiting families for adoption that match your adoption preferences.
This will show you how a family interacts with each other in their own home
environment without ever having to leave the comfort of your own home.

When you find a family you'd like to meet, your adoption specialist can
arrange a conference call so that you can get to know each other better.

American Adoptions provides all of the services, support and guidance you need
to sort through these waiting families' profiles and choose the one that is
right for your baby.

To learn more about American Adoptions' waiting families, how many couples are
waiting to adopt with our agency, our services, or adoption in general, you
may contact an adoption specialist 24/7 at 1-800-ADOPTION or request your free
adoption information with no obligation.

#### How will the family tell my child about me and the adoption when my child

is older?

Each family has their own style of introducing adoption to the child. When you
are matched with an adoptive family, you can ask them this question. If you
would like your Adoption Specialist to discuss it for you, just let her know.
He or she can share your wishes or provide good ideas from other adoptive
families.

You will also be able to share what you want your baby to know about you. You
can complete a keepsake booklet to share hobbies, stories, photos of you and
your family and a letter to your baby. The adoptive family can provide this to
your child as he or she grows older. Be as creative as you like! Some birth
mothers have even knitted a special blanket as a gift to their baby or given a
similar symbol of their love.

The father of your baby can fill out the birth father's keepsake booklet or
write a letter too. You may have other family members who would also like to
share photos or a letter to the baby. This is your opportunity to pass on your
and your family's love and to share your personality, history and reasons for
choosing adoption. The adoptive family will treasure whatever information you
provide and will share it with the baby at an appropriate age. In most
adoptive homes, the word adoption is in the child's vocabulary early on, and
adoption is celebrated in their lives.
