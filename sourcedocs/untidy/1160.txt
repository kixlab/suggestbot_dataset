1Since the 1970s, heroin started to become a major urban problem in European
cities, constituting a threat that increased over the following decade. In the
US, especially in New York, these problems began much earlier and with greater
intensity. While there are many sociological and anthropological studies on
drug use, historical research is still rare. The same is true for studies
which focus on heroin in a broader context and not only on individual drug
takers, who are often labelled with the highly problematic term “addicts”. In
his new book _Heroin and the American City_ , Eric Schneider places strong
emphasis on the interaction of social and spatial factors and focuses on
heroin consumers as well as on heroin markets. He sees cities as the
organizing principle behind the world’s opiate market, and aims at writing an
“urban history of heroin” (p. xiii). In his view the marketing of heroin rests
on a hierarchy of cities, on special urban landscapes and on inner cities that
function as retail markets. Moreover, he emphasises the crucial importance of
city neighbourhoods with a population of heroin users and the interaction
between economic and social disadvantage. Four questions are at the centre of
Schneider’s book. In the first place he asks what is specifically ‘urban’
about heroin ? And secondly, what impact has heroin and its users had on the
city ? Schneider also studies the shifting ethnic dimensions of heroin use.
Finally, Schneider seeks to analyze the dynamics of the commodity chain of
heroin from the international to the local city level.

2Schneider focuses mainly on New York. This city was the leading international
and national centre for marketing and consumption of heroin. Between roughly
1940 and 1985 he identifies three waves of heroin consumption in New York. The
first phase, covering the post-Second World War years, saw the expanding
growth of opium in Mexico and the reconstruction of trading routes. The mass-
migration of African-Americans and Hispanics into segregated city
neighbourhoods re-established the supply and demand which had been interrupted
by the War. During this phase the profile of heroin users changed from (older)
white working class males to primarily African-American and Latino drug
consumers. Since the mid- to late-1960s heroin was also widely consumed by
young whites. The consumption of heroin in this second phase was paralleled by
an explosion of city crime. While punishment was intensified at the street
level, federal government spent much money funding treatment for addiction.
This was motivated by the huge numbers of heroin consumers among Vietnam
veterans. A third wave of heroin consumption began in the early 1970s,
initiated by a growing supply of the drug. Around 1985 new drugs like crack
cocaine led to a new pattern of drug consumption which came on top of the
problems created by heroin use.

3Schneider’s main argument goes as follows : After the Second World War, as
African-Americans migrated into big cities, they created a spatially
concentrated population of marginalized people, a very good structure for
heroin entrepreneurs. In this process demarcated central city areas were
created, where drugs were retailed, purchased and consumed. These processes
insured that drug knowledge could easily be passed from one generation to the
other. Young people in particular adopted a life style in which heroin played
an important role. In these neighbourhoods heroin users were instrumental in
driving up crime rates as well as making life fairly difficult for the other
inhabitants. As more and more inner city neighbourhoods became abandoned in
the late 1960s this in turn created urban landscapes that facilitated drug
trade. At that time, more and more white youths felt alienated from the
mainstream American way of life which led them to experimenting with drugs.

4In chapter one Schneider shows how New York shaped the heroin trade and
market. It had big pharmaceutical companies, a huge port and a long-standing
and well-developed underground economy. Until the 1970s New York kept its
leading role as a centre for heroin because of its big market. In chapter two
we learn that heroin first became an important drug in the 1940s’ Jazz music
scene of the city. Schneider then develops this argument in chapter three,
showing that by the mid-1950s heroin use among white working-class males,
which had experienced a tremendous upsurge after the Second World War, was in
decline. Interestingly, while white users learned about heroin mostly in
entertainment districts, African Americans got heroin locally in their
neighbourhood, where areas for drug markets and drug use were abundant (46).
Chapter four shows that during the 1950s the challenges that heroin posed to
adolescents was an omnipresent theme in media such as comic books and popular
nonfiction literature. Especially masculinity among middle-class American
teenagers seemed to be threatened by heroin addiction. As Schneider puts it,
“female-dominated homes produced sons who had personalities ill-fitted for
modern life and who could not resist the lures of adult pushers” (p. 66).
These pushers, in turn, symbolized a threat to American life that was greater
than communism or the Mafia.

5Chapter five focuses on the highly ethnically divided heroin market with
special attention paid to the heroin markets of the US-West Coast (Los
Angeles, San Francisco), where gangs formed a closed trading system. Chapter
six analyses the new wave of heroin use which started in the early 1960s. In
New York at the end of that decade the population of known heroin users
doubled, reaching a number of at least 60,000. Three factors influenced these
changes in the underground economy. First, as Schneider underlines, policing
contributed strongly to creating new jobs in the heroin trade. Since dealers
wanted to minimize the risk of getting caught by the increasing numbers of
antinarcotics policemen, the heroin market became more decentralized. Second,
smuggling took new routes and new modes of smuggling were invented. Third,
corrupt narcotics policemen in New York helped to promote heroin use. Unlike
the early years of the twentieth century, it was now the police not the
political machineries that controlled the New York’s vice markets. Schneider
states that in the late 1960s the collection of money formed the chief
occupation of several police officers within each city precinct (108) : The
“market for illegal narcotics shaped the police department more than the
police department shaped the market” (113). Chapter seven describes the crime
wave that hit New York by the mid-1960s, especially the Lower East Side, East
Harlem and South Bronx. Although heroin was not the only factor driving this
crime wave, it was an important player, as the geography of heroin was closely
linked to the geography of crime. This upswing in crime was, as Schneider
rightly stresses, “neither a reporting artefact nor the result of a media-
driven moral panic” (117). Chapter eight shows how in the 1970s heroin use
spread into suburbs like New York’s Greenwich Village or Haight-Asbury in San
Francisco. In both areas the young white middleclass drug users met some
existing networks of hippie- or old beat generation drug users who often also
consumed amphetamines. Again, coffeehouses, music clubs and bars served as
drug market places. Chapter nine discusses the problems that heroin created
among soldiers in Vietnam, as well as the invention of methadone as a therapy
against heroin addiction. Schneider also points to the fact that many Vietnam
veterans stopped using heroin when they came back to normal life in the US.
This in turn led some experts to question the widespread assumptions
concerning the addictive potentialities of heroin. In this chapter Schneider
convincingly makes the argument, that drug use was mainly influenced by the
social setting of the inner city and less by the minds and bodies of the
heroin users. In the mid-1970s a heroin drought hit the US-East Coast due to
the breakdown of supply from Turkish and French sources. Heroin, however, was
soon supplied from Mexico and from Asia. These far more decentralized drug
market created many more problems to drug policing than the centralized
systems of the preceding years had done. The open drug market signalled the
advent of third wave of heroin consumption during which the number of heroin
users rose by 50 per cent and included many middle-class whites. Especially in
the Lower East Side neighbourhood, the music scene (this time punk music) and
heroin formed a strong coalition, as had been the case with jazz music in the
1940s. During the 1980s, however, the importance of heroin was eclipsed by
crack cocaine. Crack cocaine was easier to use and much cheaper than heroin.
Crack created new markets where many dealers exploited themselves to a yet
unknown level, developing a “form of bootstrap capitalism” (194).

6Eric Schneider has written a brilliant book based on a rich set of sources
and is an extremely stimulating contribution to the social history of urban
heroin consumption in the second half of the twentieth century. Sometimes,
however, the strength of the book – its wide geographical range – has some
structural costs. Moreover, the reader is not always informed about the
precise criteria that influenced the choice of the many case studies that are
presented in the book. As a result the analytical focus sometimes gets a
little bit lost. Overall, however, this is a publication that will stand for
many years as the reference book on US urban drug consumption and drug
markets.
