# Abortion Statistics

### Current United States Data*

  * Total number of abortions in the U.S. 1973-2013: 56.5 million+
  * 219 abortions per 1,000 live births (according to the Centers for Disease Control)
  * Abortions per year: 1.058 million
  * Abortions per day: 2,899
  * Abortions per hour: 120
  * 1 abortion every 30 seconds

These statistics include only surgical and medical abortions. Because many
contraceptive measures are abortifacients (drugs that induce or cause
abortions), it is important not to overlook the number of children killed by
chemical abortions. Since 1965, an average of 11 million women has used
abortifacient methods of birth control in the United States at any given time.
Using formulas based on the way the birth control pill works, pharmacy experts
project that about 14 million chemical abortions occur in the United States
each year, providing a projected total of well in excess of 610 million
chemical abortions between 1965 and 2009.

When conducting research on abortion statistics, you may also encounter two
different sets of numbers. One set is from the Centers for Disease Control and
the other is from the Guttmacher Institute, the "independent research arm" of
Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

The Guttmacher Institute totals are actually the more accurate since the
Institute conducts private research on abortion providers throughout the
country and because not all states are required to report to the CDC. In fact,
California and New York, where high numbers of abortions occur, are not
included in CDC figures.
