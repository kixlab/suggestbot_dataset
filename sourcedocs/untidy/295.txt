The structure of part of a DNA double helix

**Deoxyribonucleic acid** (/ diˈɒksɪraɪboʊnjuːkliːɪk, -kleɪ-/ (![About this

sound](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-

Loudspeaker.svg.png) listen);[1] **DNA** ) is a molecule composed of two
chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic
instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all
known organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic
acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides),
nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are
essential for all known forms of life.

The two DNA strands are also known as polynucleotides as they are composed of
simpler monomeric units called nucleotides.[2][3] Each nucleotide is composed
of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G],
adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate
group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds
between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting
in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two
separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing
rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded
DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups,
pyrimidines and purines. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the
purines are adenine and guanine.

Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information.
This information is replicated as and when the two strands separate. A large
part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these
sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences. The two strands of
DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel.
Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally,
_bases_ ). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone
that encodes genetic information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as
a template in a process called transcription. Under the genetic code, these
RNA strands specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process
called translation.

Within eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called
chromosomes. Before typical cell division, these chromosomes are duplicated in
the process of DNA replication, providing a complete set of chromosomes for
each daughter cell. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists)
store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus as nuclear DNA, and some in
the mitochondria as mitochondrial DNA or in chloroplasts as chloroplast
DNA.[4] In contrast, prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only
in the cytoplasm, in circular chromosomes. Within eukaryotic chromosomes,
chromatin proteins, such as histones, compact and organize DNA. These
compacting structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins,
helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

DNA was first isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its molecular structure
was first identified by Francis Crick and James Watson at the Cavendish
Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose model-building
efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling, who
was a post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin. DNA is used by researchers
as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic
theorem and the theory of elasticity. The unique material properties of DNA
have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers
interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this
field are DNA origami and DNA-based hybrid materials.[5]

Chemical structure of DNA; hydrogen bonds shown as dotted lines

DNA is a long polymer made from repeating units called nucleotides.[6][7] The
structure of DNA is dynamic along its length, being capable of coiling into
tight loops and other shapes.[8] In all species it is composed of two helical
chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Both chains are coiled around
the same axis, and have the same pitch of 34 angstroms (Å) (3.4 nanometres).
The pair of chains has a radius of 10 angstroms (1.0 nanometre).[9] According
to another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain
measured 22 to 26 angstroms wide (2.2 to 2.6 nanometres), and one nucleotide
unit measured 3.3 Å (0.33 nm) long.[10] Although each individual nucleotide is
very small, a DNA polymer can be very large and contain hundreds of millions,
such as in chromosome 1. Chromosome 1 is the largest human chromosome with
approximately 220 million base pairs,[11] and would be 85 mm long if
straightened.

DNA does not usually exist as a single strand, but instead as a pair of
strands that are held tightly together.[9][12] These two long strands coil
around each other, in the shape of a double helix. The nucleotide contains
both a segment of the backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain
together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the
helix). A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside, and a base
linked to a sugar and to one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide.
A biopolymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a
polynucleotide.[13]

The backbone of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar
residues.[14] The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-
carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form
phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent
sugar rings. These are known as the 3′-end (three prime end), and 5′-end (five
prime end) carbons, the prime symbol being used to distinguish these carbon
atoms from those of the base to which the deoxyribose forms a glycosidic bond.
When imagining DNA, each phosphoryl is normally considered to "belong" to the
nucleotide whose 5′ carbon forms a bond therewith. Any DNA strand therefore
normally has one end at which there is a phosphoryl attached to the 5′ carbon
of a ribose (the 5′ phosphoryl) and another end at which there is a free
hydroxyl attached to the 3′ carbon of a ribose (the 3′ hydroxyl). The
orientation of the 3′ and 5′ carbons along the sugar-phosphate backbone
confers directionality (sometimes called polarity) to each DNA strand. In a
nucleic acid double helix, the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is
opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel.
The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five
prime end (5′ ), and three prime end (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal
phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference
between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced
by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA.[12]

A section of DNA. The bases lie horizontally between the two spiraling
strands[15] (animated version).

The DNA double helix is stabilized primarily by two forces: hydrogen bonds
between nucleotides and base-stacking interactions among aromatic
nucleobases.[16] In the cytosol of the cell, the conjugated pi bonds of
nucleotide bases align perpendicular to the axis of the DNA molecule,
minimizing their interaction with the solvation shell. The four bases found in
DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). These four
bases are attached to the sugar-phosphate to form the complete nucleotide, as
shown for adenosine monophosphate. Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine
pairs with cytosine, forming A-T and G-C base pairs.[17][18]

### Nucleobase classification

The nucleobases are classified into two types: the purines, A and G, which are
fused five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds, and the pyrimidines, the
six-membered rings C and T.[12] A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, uracil (U),
usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking
a methyl group on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA, many artificial
nucleic acid analogues have been created to study the properties of nucleic
acids, or for use in biotechnology.[19]

### Non-canonical bases

Uracil is not usually found in DNA, occurring only as a breakdown product of
cytosine. However, in several bacteriophages, such as _Bacillus subtilis_
phages PBS1 and PBS2 and _Yersinia_ phage piR1-37, thymine has been replaced
by uracil.[20] Another phage—Staphylococcal phage S6—has been identified with
a genome where thymine has been replaced by uracil.[21]

Uracil is also found in the DNA of _Plasmodium falciparum_ [22] It is present
is relatively small amounts (7–10 uracil residues per million bases).

5-hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine,(hm5dU) is also known to replace thymidine in
several genomes including the _Bacillus phages_ SPO1, ϕe, SP8, H1, 2C and
SP82. Another modified uracil—5-dihydroxypentauracil—has also been
described.[23]

Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a modified form of uracil, is
also found in several organisms: the flagellates _Diplonema_ and _Euglena_ ,
and all the kinetoplastid genera.[24] Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps:
in the first step, a specific thymidine in DNA is converted into
hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second, HOMedU is glycosylated to form
J.[25] Proteins that bind specifically to this base have been
identified.[26][27][28] These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the
Tet1 oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid
leukemia.[29] J appears to act as a termination signal for RNA polymerase
II.[30][31]

In 1976, the S-2La bacteriophage, which infects species of the genus
_Synechocystis_ , was found to have all the adenosine bases within its genome
replaced by 2,6-diaminopurine.[32] In 2016 deoxyarchaeosine was found to be
present in the genomes of several bacteria and the _Escherichia_ phage 9g.[33]

Modified bases also occur in DNA. The first of these recognised was
5-methylcytosine, which was found in the genome of _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ in 1925.[34] The complete replacement of cytosine by
5-glycosylhydroxymethylcytosine in T even phages (T2, T4 and T6) was observed
in 1953.[35] In the genomes of Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp12 and
halovirus FH the full complement of cystosine has been replaced by
5-methylcytosine.[36][37] 6N-methyladenine was discovered to be present in DNA
in 1955.[38] N6-carbamoyl-methyladenine was described in 1975.[39]
7-Methylguanine was described in 1976.[40] N4-methylcytosine in DNA was
described in 1983.[41] In 1985 5-hydroxycytosine was found in the genomes of
the Rhizobium phages RL38JI and N17.[42] α-putrescinylthymine occurs in both
the genomes of the _Delftia_ phage ΦW-14 and the _Bacillus_ phage SP10.[43]
α-glutamylthymidine is found in the Bacillus phage SP01 and
5-dihydroxypentyluracil is found in the Bacillus phage SP15.

The reason for the presence of these non canonical bases in DNA is not known.
It seems likely that at least part of the reason for their presence in
bacterial viruses (phages) is to avoid the restriction enzymes present in
bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune
system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses.

This does not appear to be the entire story. Four modifications to the
cytosine residues in human DNA have been reported.[44] These modifications are
the addition of methyl (CH3)-, hydroxymethyl (CH2OH)-, formyl (CHO)- and
carboxyl (COOH)- groups. These modifications are thought to have regulatory
functions.

Uracil is found in the centromeric regions of at least two human chromosomes
(chromosome 6 and chromosome 11).[45]

### Listing of non canonical bases found in DNA

Seventeen non canonical bases are known to occur in DNA. Most of these are
modifications of the canonical bases plus uracil.

DNA major and minor grooves. The latter is a binding site for the Hoechst
stain dye 33258.

### Grooves

Twin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found
tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent
to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not
symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally
sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22 angstroms (Å) wide and the other,
the minor groove, is 12 Å wide.[46] The width of the major groove means that
the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the
minor groove. As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can
bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with
the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove.[47] This situation varies
in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell _(see below)_ , but the major
and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that
would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.

### Base pairing

Further information: Base pair

In a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just
one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called complementary base
pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine
bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to
guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding
together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another
type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form
between guanine and cytosine.[48] As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can
be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double
helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or
high temperature.[49] As a result of this base pair complementarity, all the
information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on
each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific
interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions
of DNA in organisms.[7]

Top, a **GC** base pair with three hydrogen bonds. Bottom, an **AT** base pair
with two hydrogen bonds. Non-covalent hydrogen bonds between the pairs are
shown as dashed lines.

The two types of base pairs form different numbers of hydrogen bonds, AT
forming two hydrogen bonds, and GC forming three hydrogen bonds (see figures,
right). DNA with high GC-content is more stable than DNA with low GC-content.

As noted above, most DNA molecules are actually two polymer strands, bound
together in a helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (
**dsDNA** ) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking
interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come
apart—a process known as melting—to form two single-stranded DNA ( **ssDNA** )
molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH
also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is
rarely used).

The stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the GC-content (% G,C
basepairs) but also on sequence (since stacking is sequence specific) and also
length (longer molecules are more stable). The stability can be measured in
various ways; a common way is the "melting temperature", which is the
temperature at which 50% of the ds molecules are converted to ss molecules;
melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of
DNA. As a result, it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall
length of a DNA double helix that determines the strength of the association
between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have
stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have
weaker-interacting strands.[50] In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that
need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT Pribnow box in some promoters,
tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.[51]

In the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding
the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their melting
temperature (also called _T m_ value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double
helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely
independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single
common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.[52]

### Sense and antisense

Further information: Sense (molecular biology)

A DNA sequence is called a "sense" sequence if it is the same as that of a
messenger RNA copy that is translated into protein.[53] The sequence on the
opposite strand is called the "antisense" sequence. Both sense and antisense
sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both
strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes
and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of
these RNAs are not entirely clear.[54] One proposal is that antisense RNAs are
involved in regulating gene expression through RNA-RNA base pairing.[55]

A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in plasmids and
viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having
overlapping genes.[56] In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty,
encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when
read in the opposite direction along the other strand. In bacteria, this
overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription,[57] while in
viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be
encoded within the small viral genome.[58]

### Supercoiling

Further information: DNA supercoil

DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called DNA supercoiling. With DNA
in its "relaxed" state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix
once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more
tightly or more loosely wound.[59] If the DNA is twisted in the direction of
the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly
together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative
supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has
slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by enzymes called
topoisomerases.[60] These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting
stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as transcription
and DNA replication.[61]

### Alternative DNA structures

Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid, Molecular models of DNA, and DNA structure

DNA exists in many possible conformations that include A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA
forms, although, only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in
functional organisms.[14] The conformation that DNA adopts depends on the
hydration level, DNA sequence, the amount and direction of supercoiling,
chemical modifications of the bases, the type and concentration of metal ions,
and the presence of polyamines in solution.[62]

The first published reports of A-DNA X-ray diffraction patterns—and also
B-DNA—used analyses based on Patterson transforms that provided only a limited
amount of structural information for oriented fibers of DNA.[63][64] An
alternative analysis was then proposed by Wilkins _et al._ , in 1953, for the
_in vivo_ B-DNA X-ray diffraction-scattering patterns of highly hydrated DNA
fibers in terms of squares of Bessel functions.[65] In the same journal, James
Watson and Francis Crick presented their molecular modeling analysis of the
DNA X-ray diffraction patterns to suggest that the structure was a double-
helix.[9]

Although the _B-DNA form_ is most common under the conditions found in
cells,[66] it is not a well-defined conformation but a family of related DNA
conformations[67] that occur at the high hydration levels present in cells.
Their corresponding X-ray diffraction and scattering patterns are
characteristic of molecular paracrystals with a significant degree of
disorder.[68][69]

Compared to B-DNA, the A-DNA form is a wider right-handed spiral, with a
shallow, wide minor groove and a narrower, deeper major groove. The A form
occurs under non-physiological conditions in partly dehydrated samples of DNA,
while in the cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA
strands, and in enzyme-DNA complexes.[70][71] Segments of DNA where the bases
have been chemically modified by methylation may undergo a larger change in
conformation and adopt the Z form. Here, the strands turn about the helical
axis in a left-handed spiral, the opposite of the more common B form.[72]
These unusual structures can be recognized by specific Z-DNA binding proteins
and may be involved in the regulation of transcription.[73]

### Alternative DNA chemistry

For many years, exobiologists have proposed the existence of a shadow
biosphere, a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically
different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One
of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use arsenic instead of
phosphorus in DNA. A report in 2010 of the possibility in the bacterium
GFAJ-1, was announced,[74][74][75] though the research was disputed,[75][76]
and evidence suggests the bacterium actively prevents the incorporation of
arsenic into the DNA backbone and other biomolecules.[77]

### Quadruplex structures

Further information: G-quadruplex

At the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called
telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to
replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that
normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes.[78]
These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the
DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be
corrected.[79] In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-
stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG
sequence.[80]

Parallel_telomere_quadruple.png)

DNA quadruplex formed by telomere repeats. The looped conformation of the DNA
backbone is very different from the typical DNA helix. The green spheres in
the center represent potassium ions.[81]

These guanine-rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming
structures of stacked sets of four-base units, rather than the usual base
pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases form a flat plate
and these flat four-base units then stack on top of each other, to form a
stable G-quadruplex structure.[82] These structures are stabilized by hydrogen
bonding between the edges of the bases and chelation of a metal ion in the
centre of each four-base unit.[83] Other structures can also be formed, with
the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around
the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base
to the central structure.

In addition to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop
structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA
curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins.[84] At
the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a
region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-
helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded
structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.[82]

### Branched DNA

Further information: Branched DNA and DNA nanotechnology

In DNA, fraying occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an
otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur
if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to
hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although
the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA,
complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also
possible.[85] Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct
geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.

### Artificial bases

Main article: Nucleic acid analogue

Several artificial nucleobases have been synthesized, and successfully
incorporated in the eight-base DNA analogue named Hachimoji DNA. Dubbed S, B,
P, and Z, these artificial bases are capable of bonding with each other in a
predictable way (S–B and P–Z), maintain the double helix structure of DNA, and
be transcribed to RNA. Their existence implies that there is nothing special
about the four natural nucleobases that evolved on Earth.[86][87]

### Base modifications and DNA packaging

Further information: DNA methylation and Chromatin remodeling

The expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in
chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be
involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression
usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging
and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications
of the histone protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin
structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes
(see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, crosstalk between DNA
methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect
chromatin and gene expression.[88]

For one example, cytosine methylation produces 5-methylcytosine, which is
important for X-inactivation of chromosomes.[89] The average level of
methylation varies between organisms—the worm _Caenorhabditis elegans_ lacks
cytosine methylation, while vertebrates have higher levels, with up to 1% of
their DNA containing 5-methylcytosine.[90] Despite the importance of
5-methylcytosine, it can deaminate to leave a thymine base, so methylated
cytosines are particularly prone to mutations.[91] Other base modifications
include adenine methylation in bacteria, the presence of
5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the brain,[92] and the glycosylation of uracil to
produce the "J-base" in kinetoplastids.[93][94]

### Damage

A covalent adduct between a metabolically activated form of benzo[ _a_
]pyrene, the major mutagen in tobacco smoke, and DNA[95]

DNA can be damaged by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence.
Mutagens include oxidizing agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy
electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of
DNA damage produced depends on the type of mutagen. For example, UV light can
damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between
pyrimidine bases.[96] On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or
hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base
modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks.[97] A
typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative
damage.[98] Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand
breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations,
insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal
translocations.[99] These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent
limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would
all eventually develop cancer.[100][101] DNA damages that are naturally
occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen
species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur
frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA
damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA
damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This
accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of
aging.[102][103][104]

Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is
called _intercalation_. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules;
examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For
an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting
the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both
transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations.[105] As a
result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, and in the case of thalidomide,
a teratogen.[106] Others such as benzo[ _a_ ]pyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin
form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication.[107] Nevertheless, due to
their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar
toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer
cells.[108]

## Biological functions

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Eukaryote_DNA-

en.svg/320px-Eukaryote_DNA-en.svg.png)

Location of eukaryote nuclear DNA within the chromosomes

DNA usually occurs as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes, and circular
chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its
genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA
arranged into 46 chromosomes.[109] The information carried by DNA is held in
the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic
information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example,
in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence
is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the
DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to
make a matching protein sequence in a process called translation, which
depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative
fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called
DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles;
here the focus is on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that
mediate the function of the genome.

### Genes and genomes

Further information: Cell nucleus, Chromatin, Chromosome, Gene, and Noncoding
DNA

Genomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called DNA
condensation, to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes,
DNA is located in the cell nucleus, with small amounts in mitochondria and
chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped
body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.[110] The genetic information in a
genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an
organism is called its genotype. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region
of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes
contain an open reading frame that can be transcribed, and regulatory
sequences such as promoters and enhancers, which control transcription of the
open reading frame.

In many species, only a small fraction of the total sequence of the genome
encodes protein. For example, only about 1.5% of the human genome consists of
protein-coding exons, with over 50% of human DNA consisting of non-coding
repetitive sequences.[111] The reasons for the presence of so much noncoding
DNA in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in genome size, or
_C-value_ , among species, represent a long-standing puzzle known as the
"C-value enigma".[112] However, some DNA sequences that do not code protein
may still encode functional non-coding RNA molecules, which are involved in
the regulation of gene expression.[113]

(orange)[114]

Some noncoding DNA sequences play structural roles in chromosomes. Telomeres
and centromeres typically contain few genes but are important for the function
and stability of chromosomes.[79][115] An abundant form of noncoding DNA in
humans are pseudogenes, which are copies of genes that have been disabled by
mutation.[116] These sequences are usually just molecular fossils, although
they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material for the creation of new
genes through the process of gene duplication and divergence.[117]

### Transcription and translation

Further information: Genetic code, Transcription (genetics), and Protein
biosynthesis

A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can
influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases
along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or
more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of
genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of
translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists
of three-letter 'words' called _codons_ formed from a sequence of three
nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).

In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by RNA
polymerase. This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome that reads the RNA
sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA, which carries
amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64
possible codons (43 combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino
acids, giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also
three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region;
these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.

DNA_replication_en.svg.png)

DNA replication. The double helix is unwound by a helicase and topoisomerase.
Next, one DNA polymerase produces the leading strand copy. Another DNA
polymerase binds to the lagging strand. This enzyme makes discontinuous
segments (called Okazaki fragments) before DNA ligase joins them together.

### Replication

Further information: DNA replication

Cell division is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides,
it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have
the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of
DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are
separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an
enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by
finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it
onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a
5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel
strands of the double helix.[118] In this way, the base on the old strand
dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a
perfect copy of its DNA.

### Extracellular nucleic acids

Naked extracellular DNA (eDNA), most of it released by cell death, is nearly
ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may be as high as 2
μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at
88 μg/L.[119] Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may
be involved in horizontal gene transfer;[120] it may provide nutrients;[121]
and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics.[122]
Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the
biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to
regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the
biofilm;[123] it may contribute to biofilm formation;[124] and it may
contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological
stress.[125]

Cell-free fetal DNA is found in the blood of the mother, and can be sequenced
to determine a great deal of information about the developing fetus.[126]

## Interactions with proteins

All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein
interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a
single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the
polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA
replication are particularly important.

### DNA-binding proteins

* * *

Interaction of DNA (in orange) with histones (in blue). These proteins' basic
amino acids bind to the acidic phosphate groups on DNA.

Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific
DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with
structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure
called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a
complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple
types of proteins are involved.[127][128] The histones form a disk-shaped
complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-
stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are
formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the
acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent
of the base sequence.[129] Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid
residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation.[130] These
chemical changes alter the strength of the interaction between the DNA and the
histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and
changing the rate of transcription.[131] Other non-specific DNA-binding
proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to
bent or distorted DNA.[132] These proteins are important in bending arrays of
nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up
chromosomes.[133]

A distinct group of DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that
specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the
best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the
double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA
repair.[134] These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and
protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.

Lambda_repressor_1LMB.png)

The lambda repressor helix-turn-helix transcription factor bound to its DNA
target[135]

In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences.
The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors,
which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor
binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the
transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The
transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA
polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other
mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it
to begin transcription.[136] Alternatively, transcription factors can bind
enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the
accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.[137]

As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome, changes in the
activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of
genes.[138] Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the signal
transduction processes that control responses to environmental changes or
cellular differentiation and development. The specificity of these
transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making
multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to "read" the
DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove,
where the bases are most accessible.[47]

### DNA-modifying enzymes

#### Nucleases and ligases

Nucleases are enzymes that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the
phosphodiester bonds. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of
DNA strands are called exonucleases, while endonucleases cut within strands.
The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction
endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV
enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes
a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect bacteria
against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the
bacterial cell, acting as part of the restriction modification system.[140] In
technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in molecular cloning
and DNA fingerprinting.

Enzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands.[141] Ligases
are particularly important in lagging strand DNA replication, as they join
together the short segments of DNA produced at the replication fork into a
complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in DNA repair and
genetic recombination.[141]

#### Topoisomerases and helicases

Topoisomerases are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These
proteins change the amount of supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes work
by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing
its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break.[60] Other
types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a
second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix.[142]
Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA
replication and transcription.[61]

Helicases are proteins that are a type of molecular motor. They use the
chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates, predominantly adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA
double helix into single strands.[143] These enzymes are essential for most
processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.

#### Polymerases

Polymerases are enzymes that synthesize polynucleotide chains from nucleoside
triphosphates. The sequence of their products is created based on existing
polynucleotide chains—which are called _templates_. These enzymes function by
repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ hydroxyl group at the end of the
growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′
to 3′ direction.[144] In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming
nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to
accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases
are classified according to the type of template that they use.

In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases make copies of DNA
polynucleotide chains. To preserve biological information, it is essential
that the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the
sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a
proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes
in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched
nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is
activated and the incorrect base removed.[145] In most organisms, DNA
polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains
multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.[146]

RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy
the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include reverse transcriptase,
which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses,
and telomerase, which is required for the replication of telomeres.[78][147]
For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus
replication.[147] Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its
own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres at the
ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring
chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.[79]

Transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that copies the
sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA
polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA
strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript
until it reaches a region of DNA called the terminator, where it halts and
detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, RNA
polymerase II, the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human
genome, operates as part of a large protein complex with multiple regulatory
and accessory subunits.[148]

Further information: Genetic recombination

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Chromosomal_Recombination.svg/250px-

Chromosomal_Recombination.svg.png)

Recombination involves the breaking and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F)
to produce two rearranged chromosomes (C1 and C2).

A DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human
cells, the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus
called "chromosome territories".[150] This physical separation of different
chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable
repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is in
chromosomal crossover which occurs during sexual reproduction, when genetic
recombination occurs. Chromosomal crossover is when two DNA helices break,
swap a section and then rejoin.

Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces
new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of natural selection
and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins.[151] Genetic
recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's
response to double-strand breaks.[152]

The most common form of chromosomal crossover is homologous recombination,
where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-
homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce
chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination
reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51.[153]
The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an
endonuclease or damage to the DNA.[154] A series of steps catalyzed in part by
the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one
Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is
annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction
is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of
chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is
then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released
DNA.[155] Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination.
There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage.
The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west
cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction
during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to
exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.

## Evolution

Further information: RNA world hypothesis

DNA contains the genetic information that allows all forms of life to
function, grow and reproduce. However, it is unclear how long in the
4-billion-year history of life DNA has performed this function, as it has been
proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic
material.[156][157] RNA may have acted as the central part of early cell
metabolism as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out catalysis
as part of ribozymes.[158] This ancient RNA world where nucleic acid would
have been used for both catalysis and genetics may have influenced the
evolution of the current genetic code based on four nucleotide bases. This
would occur, since the number of different bases in such an organism is a
trade-off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and
a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes.[159]
However, there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems, as recovery
of DNA from most fossils is impossible because DNA survives in the environment
for less than one million years, and slowly degrades into short fragments in
solution.[160] Claims for older DNA have been made, most notably a report of
the isolation of a viable bacterium from a salt crystal 250 million years
old,[161] but these claims are controversial.[162][163]

Building blocks of DNA (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may
have been formed extraterrestrially in outer space.[164][165][166] Complex DNA
and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine,
have also been formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking those found
in outer space, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in
meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most
carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants
or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.[167]

## Uses in technology

### Genetic engineering

Further information: Molecular biology, Nucleic acid methods, and Genetic
engineering

Methods have been developed to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-
chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as
restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and
biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA
technology. Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled
from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms in the form
of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector.[168] The
genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such
as recombinant proteins, used in medical research,[169] or be grown in
agriculture.[170][171]

### DNA profiling

Further information: DNA profiling

Forensic scientists can use DNA in blood, semen, skin, saliva or hair found at
a crime scene to identify a matching DNA of an individual, such as a
perpetrator.[172] This process is formally termed DNA profiling, also called
_DNA fingerprinting_. In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of
repetitive DNA, such as short tandem repeats and minisatellites, are compared
between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for
identifying a matching DNA.[173] However, identification can be complicated if
the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people.[174] DNA profiling was
developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys,[175] and first used
in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 Enderby murders
case.[176]

The development of forensic science and the ability to now obtain genetic
matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-
examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically
impossible at the time of the original examination. Combined with the removal
of the double jeopardy law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened
where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a
jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample
of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained
forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred.
This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of
serious crime.

DNA profiling is also used successfully to positively identify victims of mass
casualty incidents,[177] bodies or body parts in serious accidents, and
individual victims in mass war graves, via matching to family members.

DNA profiling is also used in DNA paternity testing to determine if someone is
the biological parent or grandparent of a child with the probability of
parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related
to the child. Normal DNA sequencing methods happen after birth, but there are
new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.[178]

### DNA enzymes or catalytic DNA

Further information: Deoxyribozyme

Deoxyribozymes, also called DNAzymes or catalytic DNA, were first discovered
in 1994.[179] They are mostly single stranded DNA sequences isolated from a
large pool of random DNA sequences through a combinatorial approach called in
vitro selection or systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment
(SELEX). DNAzymes catalyze variety of chemical reactions including RNA-DNA
cleavage, RNA-DNA ligation, amino acids phosphorylation-dephosphorylation,
carbon-carbon bond formation, and etc. DNAzymes can enhance catalytic rate of
chemical reactions up to 100,000,000,000-fold over the uncatalyzed
reaction.[180] The most extensively studied class of DNAzymes is RNA-cleaving
types which have been used to detect different metal ions and designing
therapeutic agents. Several metal-specific DNAzymes have been reported
including the GR-5 DNAzyme (lead-specific),[179] the CA1-3 DNAzymes (copper-
specific),[181] the 39E DNAzyme (uranyl-specific) and the NaA43 DNAzyme
(sodium-specific).[182] The NaA43 DNAzyme, which is reported to be more than
10,000-fold selective for sodium over other metal ions, was used to make a
real-time sodium sensor in cells.

### Bioinformatics

Further information: Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics involves the development of techniques to store, data mine,
search and manipulate biological data, including DNA nucleic acid sequence
data. These have led to widely applied advances in computer science,
especially string searching algorithms, machine learning, and database
theory.[183] String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence
of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, were developed
to search for specific sequences of nucleotides.[184] The DNA sequence may be
aligned with other DNA sequences to identify homologous sequences and locate
the specific mutations that make them distinct. These techniques, especially
multiple sequence alignment, are used in studying phylogenetic relationships
and protein function.[185] Data sets representing entire genomes' worth of DNA
sequences, such as those produced by the Human Genome Project, are difficult
to use without the annotations that identify the locations of genes and
regulatory elements on each chromosome. Regions of DNA sequence that have the
characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA-coding genes can be
identified by gene finding algorithms, which allow researchers to predict the
presence of particular gene products and their possible functions in an
organism even before they have been isolated experimentally.[186] Entire
genomes may also be compared, which can shed light on the evolutionary history
of particular organism and permit the examination of complex evolutionary
events.

Further information: DNA nanotechnology

DNA nanotechnology uses the unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and
other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with
useful properties.[187] DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than
as a carrier of biological information. This has led to the creation of two-
dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the _DNA origami_
method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra.[188]
Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been
demonstrated,[189] and these DNA structures have been used to template the
arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin
proteins.[190]

### History and anthropology

Further information: Phylogenetics and Genetic genealogy

Because DNA collects mutations over time, which are then inherited, it
contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists
can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny.[191] This
field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology. If DNA
sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the
history of particular populations. This can be used in studies ranging from
ecological genetics to anthropology.

### Information storage

Main article: DNA digital data storage

DNA as a storage device for information has enormous potential since it has
much higher storage density compared to electronic devices. However high
costs, extremely slow read and write times (memory latency), and insufficient
reliability has prevented its practical use.[192][193]

DNA was first isolated by the Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher who, in 1869,
discovered a microscopic substance in the pus of discarded surgical bandages.
As it resided in the nuclei of cells, he called it "nuclein".[194][195] In
1878, Albrecht Kossel isolated the non-protein component of "nuclein", nucleic
acid, and later isolated its five primary nucleobases.[196][197]

In 1909, Phoebus Levene identified the base, sugar, and phosphate nucleotide
unit of the RNA (then named "yeast nucleic acid").[198][199][200] In 1929,
Levene identified deoxyribose sugar in "thymus nucleic acid" (DNA).[201]
Levene suggested that DNA consisted of a string of four nucleotide units
linked together through the phosphate groups ("tetranucleotide hypothesis").
Levene thought the chain was short and the bases repeated in a fixed order. In
1927, Nikolai Koltsov proposed that inherited traits would be inherited via a
"giant hereditary molecule" made up of "two mirror strands that would
replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using each strand as a
template".[202][203] In 1928, Frederick Griffith in his experiment discovered
that traits of the "smooth" form of _Pneumococcus_ could be transferred to the
"rough" form of the same bacteria by mixing killed "smooth" bacteria with the
live "rough" form.[204][205] This system provided the first clear suggestion
that DNA carries genetic information.

In 1933, while studying virgin sea urchin eggs, Jean Brachet suggested that
DNA is found in the cell nucleus and that RNA is present exclusively in the
cytoplasm. At the time, "yeast nucleic acid" (RNA) was thought to occur only
in plants, while "thymus nucleic acid" (DNA) only in animals. The latter was
thought to be a tetramer, with the function of buffering cellular
pH.[206][207]

In 1937, William Astbury produced the first X-ray diffraction patterns that
showed that DNA had a regular structure.[208]

In 1943, Oswald Avery, along with co-workers Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty,
identified DNA as the transforming principle, supporting Griffith's suggestion
(Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment).[209] DNA's role in heredity was confirmed
in 1952 when Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase in the Hershey–Chase experiment
showed that DNA is the genetic material of the enterobacteria phage T2.[210]

A blue plaque outside The Eagle pub commemorating Crick and Watson

Late in 1951, Francis Crick started working with James Watson at the Cavendish
Laboratory within the University of Cambridge. In 1953, Watson and Crick
suggested what is now accepted as the first correct double-helix model of DNA
structure in the journal _Nature_.[9] Their double-helix, molecular model of
DNA was then based on one X-ray diffraction image (labeled as "Photo 51")[211]
taken by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling in May 1952, and the
information that the DNA bases are paired. On 28 February 1953 Crick
interrupted patrons' lunchtime at The Eagle pub in Cambridge to announce that
he and Watson had "discovered the secret of life".[212]

Months earlier, in February 1953, Linus Pauling and Robert Corey proposed a
model for nucleic acids containing three intertwined chains, with the
phosphates near the axis, and the bases on the outside.[213] Experimental
evidence supporting the Watson and Crick model was published in a series of
five articles in the same issue of _Nature_.[214] Of these, Franklin and
Gosling's paper was the first publication of their own X-ray diffraction data
and original analysis method that partly supported the Watson and Crick
model;[64][215] this issue also contained an article on DNA structure by
Maurice Wilkins and two of his colleagues, whose analysis and _in vivo_ B-DNA
X-ray patterns also supported the presence _in vivo_ of the double-helical DNA
configurations as proposed by Crick and Watson for their double-helix
molecular model of DNA in the prior two pages of _Nature_.[65] In 1962, after
Franklin's death, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins jointly received the Nobel Prize
in Physiology or Medicine.[216] Nobel Prizes are awarded only to living
recipients. A debate continues about who should receive credit for the
discovery.[217]

In an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the central dogma of
molecular biology, which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and
proteins, and articulated the "adaptor hypothesis".[218] Final confirmation of
the replication mechanism that was implied by the double-helical structure
followed in 1958 through the Meselson–Stahl experiment.[219] Further work by
Crick and co-workers showed that the genetic code was based on non-overlapping
triplets of bases, called codons, allowing Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W.
Holley, and Marshall Warren Nirenberg to decipher the genetic code.[220] These
findings represent the birth of molecular biology.[221]
