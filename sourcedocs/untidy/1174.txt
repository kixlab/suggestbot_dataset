# Risky Business: Marijuana Use

With laws in many states allowing the use of marijuana under a variety of
circumstances, it is important to understand how it can affect mental health
and when its use becomes a serious problem. Please note- this webpage is
speaking about marijuana in general and not CBD or other derivatives.

## Availability is increasing. Attitudes are changing.

![twenty](/sites/default/files/20.png) |

![Eight](/sites/default/files/8.png) |

recreational use. [2]

57% of American adults support the legalization of marijuana. [3]

69% of American adults believe alcohol is more harmful to health than
marijuana. [4]

## When does marijuana use become a problem?

Marijuana use becomes a problem when it interferes with a person’s ability to
function in their personal and/or professional lives.

In the past year have you:

  * Used marijuana in large amounts for longer than intended?
  * Wanted to stop using marijuana, but weren’t successful in attempts to quit?
  * Spent a great deal of time getting, using, or recovering from marijuana?
  * Had strong cravings or urges to use?
  * Failed to perform work, school, or home duties because of marijuana?
  * Continued use despite it causing problems with relationships?
  * Stopped participating in activities you used to enjoy because of marijuana use?
  * Used marijuana in physically dangerous situations (driving, etc.)?
  * Continued using marijuana despite physical or mental health problems that it has caused or made worse?
  * Developed a tolerance to marijuana (needed more to get the desired effect)?
  * Felt withdrawal symptoms when you stopped using marijuana, possibly using again to relieve your discomfort?

**If you have experienced two or more of the following signs in the past year,
you may have Marijuana (cannabis) Use Disorder.** [7]

### Marijuana (cannabis) Use Disorder affects: [8]

## Can marijuana cause mental illnesses?

More research is needed for a clear answer to this question. Here's what we do
know:

![up arrow](/sites/default/files/up%20arrow.png) | Marijuana may increase the
risk of developing psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. It can also worsen
symptoms in people who already have psychosis.[9]  
---|---  
![brain icon](/sites/default/files/brain.png) | Marijuana use during
adolescence can have lasting effects, including changes to the reward system
in the brain and trouble with thinking and remembering.[10]  
![warning sign](/sites/default/files/warning.png) | Marijuana use can cause
symptoms of mental health problems like psychosis (hallucinations), anxiety
(panic attacks), depression, and sleep disorders, but these symptoms generally
fade after the effect of the drug has worn off. [11]  
![disoriented facial expression](/sites/default/files/too%20high%20face.png) |
People may get “too high” by using a strain of marijuana that is stronger than
they thought it would be, by using too much, or by consuming it in di˙erent
ways. Smoking marijuana usually takes effect quickly (a matter of minutes),
while consuming edibles usually takes longer (a matter of hours) for an
individual to feel the effects, and they may end up consuming too much because
they “don’t feel it” at first. [12]  
![marijuana leaf on brain](/sites/default/files/marijuana%20brain.png) |
Adults who have been diagnosed with marijuana (cannabis) use disorder have
high rates of mental health disorders including anxiety, depression, PTSD, and
ADHD [13]. It is hard to know whether the marijuana use disorder or the mental
health disorder appeared first, since many people use drugs to self-medicate.

## Can marijuana treat mental illnesses?

Much of the research supporting the use of marijuana or cannabis as a
treatment for mental illnesses is based on:

![man with speech bubble](/sites/default/files/anecdotal%20evidence.png) |
**OR** | ![rat icon](/sites/default/files/rat.png)  
---|---|--- 

Anecdotal Evidence

(personal accounts)

| | Experiments using different chemicals from marijuana in rats

In some states that have legalized medical marijuana, it can be prescribed to
reduce symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or stimulate appetite
in people with anorexia. Depending on the state, doctors may also be able to
prescribe marijuana for other mental health problems (like anxiety) at their
discretion if traditional methods of treatment have not been successful.

## Take control of marijuana use

  * Keep track of your marijuana use to see if you notice patterns.
  * Be specific with yourself about how you would like to change your marijuana use (how often, when, where, etc.) and your reasons for making changes.
  * Take a month-long break from marijuana. This enables your body to get rid of the drug, reduce tolerance, and get over the discomfort of withdrawal that some people feel when stopping.
  * Identify what triggers the urge to use, and think about what you can do to manage those triggers.
  * Avoid using marijuana before activities that require thinking and remembering, like school and work, or before an important or new challenge.
  * Don’t mix marijuana with alcohol or other drugs.
  * Get immediate help if you are unable to control your use or if you have a medical emergency.

local Emergency Room, call 911, reach out to The National Suicide Prevention
Lifeline's 24 hour toll-free crisis hotline, 1.800.273.TALK (1.800.273.8255),
