This report presents statistics on health insurance coverage in the United
States based on information collected in the 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018
Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplements (CPS ASEC)
and the American Community Survey (ACS).

Component ID: #ti720311225

### Highlights

• In 2017, 8.8 percent of people, or 28.5 million, did not have health
insurance at any point during the year as measured by the CPS ASEC. The
uninsured rate and number of uninsured in 2017 were not statistically
different from 2016 (8.8 percent or 28.1 million).

• The percentage of people with health insurance coverage for all or part of
2017 was 91.2 percent, not statistically different from the rate in 2016 (91.2
percent). Between 2016 and 2017, the number of people with health insurance
coverage increased by 2.3 million, up to 294.6 million.

• In 2017, private health insurance coverage continued to be more prevalent
than government coverage, at 67.2 percent and 37.7 percent, respectively. Of
the subtypes of health insurance coverage, employer-based insurance was the
most common, covering 56.0 percent of the population for some or all of the
calendar year, followed by Medicaid (19.3 percent), Medicare (17.2 percent),
direct-purchase coverage (16.0 percent), and military coverage (4.8 percent).

• Between 2016 and 2017, the rate of Medicare coverage increased by 0.6
percentage points to cover 17.2 percent of people for part or all of 2017 (up
from 16.7 percent in 2016).

• The military coverage rate increased by 0.2 percentage points to 4.8 percent
during this time. Coverage rates for employment-based coverage, direct-
purchase coverage, and Medicaid did not statistically change between 2016 and
2017.

• In 2017, the percentage of uninsured children under age 19 (5.4 percent) was
not statistically different from the percentage in 2016.

• For children under age 19 in poverty, the uninsured rate (7.8 percent) was
higher than for children not in poverty (4.9 percent).

• Between 2016 and 2017, the uninsured rate did not statistically change for
any race or Hispanic origin group.

• In 2017, non-Hispanic Whites had the lowest uninsured rate among race and
Hispanic-origin groups (6.3 percent). The uninsured rates for Blacks and
Asians were 10.6 percent and 7.3 percent, respectively. Hispanics had the
highest uninsured rate (16.1 percent).

• Between 2016 and 2017, the percentage of people without health insurance
coverage at the time of interview decreased in three states and increased in
14 states.
