>>

>> When you learned about Archimedes back in elementary school, your teacher
probably told you that a floating object displaces an amount of water equal to
its own weight. Although an ice cube pokes up out of the water, when it melts,
the level of the water should stay the same. Extrapolate this concept to an
iceberg floating in the ocean--a bigger version of the ice cube in your water
glass--and you would think that melting icebergs shouldn't contribute to sea
level rise. Well, you'd be wrong, say geoscientists at the University of
Leeds.

>>

>> In their study, published this week in _Geophysical Research Letters_ , the
researchers used satellite observations and a computer model to assess the
impacts of melting icebergs. The total amount of floating ice that is turned
into ocean water each year is equivalent to 1.5 _million_ Titanic-sized
icebergs. Due to differences in the temperature and density of the ice and
water (the seawater is warmer and saltier than the icebergs that float in it),
when the icebergs melt, the resulting ocean water is 2.6 percent greater in
volume than the volume of water that the iceberg had displaced.

>>

>> Calculated out, the ocean rises by about 49 micrometers each year due to
melting icebergs. That's not a lot of sea level rise--sea level globally is
rising by about 3 millimeters (or 3,000 micrometers) per year--but the
scientists say it deserves monitoring.

>>

>> Elsewhere in news of rising sea levels, _Slate_ profiles an EPA scientist
who warns that beaches on the Eastern seaboard are in danger of disappearing.
Is it time to abandon beachfront property?
