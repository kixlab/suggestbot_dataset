The greenhouse effect of solar radiation on the Earth's surface caused by
greenhouse gases

A **greenhouse gas** is a gas that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the
thermal infrared range. Greenhouse gases cause the greenhouse effect.[1] The
primary greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, carbon
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone. Without greenhouse gases, the
average temperature of Earth's surface would be about −18 °C (0 °F),[2] rather
than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F).[3][4][5] The atmospheres of Venus,
Mars and Titan also contain greenhouse gases.

Human activities since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (around
1750) have produced a 45% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon
dioxide (CO  
2), from 280 ppm in 1750 to 406 ppm in early 2017. This increase has occurred
despite the uptake of more than half of the emissions by various natural
"sinks" involved in the carbon cycle.[6][7] The vast majority of anthropogenic
carbon dioxide emissions (i.e., emissions produced by human activities) come
from combustion of fossil fuels, principally coal, oil, and natural gas, with
additional contributions coming from deforestation, changes in land use, soil
erosion and agriculture (including livestock).[8][9]

Should greenhouse gas emissions continue at their rate in 2017, global warming
could cause Earth's surface temperature to exceed historical values as early
as 2047, with potentially harmful effects on ecosystems, biodiversity and
human livelihoods.[10] At current emission rates temperatures could increase
by 2 °C, which the United Nations' IPCC designated as the upper limit to avoid
"dangerous" levels, by 2036.[11]

## Gases in Earth's atmosphere[edit]

Main articles: Greenhouse effect and Atmosphere of Earth

The most common gases in Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%),
and argon (0.9%). The next most common gases are carbon dioxide, nitrous
oxides, methane, and ozone. They are trace gases that account for almost one
tenth of 1% of Earth's atmosphere.

Atmospheric absorption and scattering at different wavelengths of
electromagnetic waves. The largest absorption band of carbon dioxide is not
far from the maximum in the thermal emission from ground, and it partly closes
the window of transparency of water; hence its major effect.

### Greenhouse gases[edit]

Greenhouse gases are those that absorb and emit infrared radiation in the
wavelength range emitted by Earth.[1] In order, the most abundant[
_clarification needed_ ] greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are:[

                                                * Ozone (O
                    

3)

                    
                                                * Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
                            * Hydrofluorocarbons (includes HCFCs and HFCs)
                    

Atmospheric concentrations are determined by the balance between sources
(emissions of the gas from human activities and natural systems) and sinks
(the removal of the gas from the atmosphere by conversion to a different
chemical compound or absorption by bodies of water).[12] The proportion of an
emission remaining in the atmosphere after a specified time is the "airborne
fraction" (AF). The _annual airborne fraction_ is the ratio of the atmospheric
increase in a given year to that year's total emissions. As of 2006 the annual
airborne fraction for CO  
2 was about 0.45. The annual airborne fraction increased at a rate of 0.25 ±
0.21% per year over the period 1959–2006.[13]

### Non-greenhouse gases[edit]

The major atmospheric constituents, nitrogen (N  
2), oxygen (O  
2), and argon (Ar), are not greenhouse gases because molecules containing two
atoms of the same element such as N  
2 and O  
2 have no net change in the distribution of their electrical charges when they
vibrate, and monatomic gases such as Ar do not have vibrational modes. Hence
they are almost totally unaffected by infrared radiation. Some molecules
containing just two atoms of different elements, such as carbon monoxide (CO)
and hydrogen chloride (HCl), do absorb infrared radiation, but these molecules
are short-lived in the atmosphere owing to their reactivity and solubility.
Therefore, they do not contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect and
often are omitted when discussing greenhouse gases.

### Indirect radiative effects[edit]

![world map of carbon monoxide concentrations in the lower

atmosphere](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Mopitt_first_year_carbon_monoxide.jpg/220px-

Mopitt_first_year_carbon_monoxide.jpg)

The false colors in this image represent concentrations of carbon monoxide in
the lower atmosphere, ranging from about 390 parts per billion (dark brown
pixels), to 220 parts per billion (red pixels), to 50 parts per billion (blue
pixels).[14]

Some gases have indirect radiative effects (whether or not they are greenhouse
gases themselves). This happens in two main ways. One way is that when they
break down in the atmosphere they produce another greenhouse gas. For example,
methane and carbon monoxide (CO) are oxidized to give carbon dioxide (and
methane oxidation also produces water vapor). Oxidation of CO to CO  
2 directly produces an unambiguous increase in radiative forcing although the
reason is subtle. The peak of the thermal IR emission from Earth's surface is
very close to a strong vibrational absorption band of CO  
2 (wavelength 15 microns, or wavenumber 667 cm−1). On the other hand, the
single CO vibrational band only absorbs IR at much shorter wavelengths (4.7
microns, or 2145 cm−1), where the emission of radiant energy from Earth's
surface is at least a factor of ten lower. Oxidation of methane to CO  
2, which requires reactions with the OH radical, produces an instantaneous
reduction in radiative absorption and emission since CO  
2 is a weaker greenhouse gas than methane. However, the oxidations of CO and
CH  
4 are entwined since both consume OH radicals. In any case, the calculation of
the total radiative effect includes both direct and indirect forcing.

A second type of indirect effect happens when chemical reactions in the
atmosphere involving these gases change the concentrations of greenhouse
gases. For example, the destruction of non-methane volatile organic compounds
(NMVOCs) in the atmosphere can produce ozone. The size of the indirect effect
can depend strongly on where and when the gas is emitted.[15]

Methane has indirect effects in addition to forming CO  
2. The main chemical that reacts with methane in the atmosphere is the hydroxyl radical (OH), thus more methane means that the concentration of OH goes down. Effectively, methane increases its own atmospheric lifetime and therefore its overall radiative effect. The oxidation of methane can produce both ozone and water; and is a major source of water vapor in the normally dry stratosphere. CO and NMVOCs produce CO  
2 when they are oxidized. They remove OH from the atmosphere, and this leads
to higher concentrations of methane. The surprising effect of this is that the
global warming potential of CO is three times that of CO  
2.[16] The same process that converts NMVOCs to carbon dioxide can also lead
to the formation of tropospheric ozone. Halocarbons have an indirect effect
because they destroy stratospheric ozone. Finally, hydrogen can lead to ozone
production and CH  
4 increases as well as producing stratospheric water vapor.[15]

### Contribution of clouds to Earth's greenhouse effect[edit]

The major non-gas contributor to Earth's greenhouse effect, clouds, also
absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus have an effect on greenhouse gas
radiative properties. Clouds are water droplets or ice crystals suspended in
the atmosphere.[17][18]

## Impacts on the overall greenhouse effect[edit]

![refer to caption and adjacent

text](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Attribution_of_individual_atmospheric_component_contributions_to_the_terrestrial_greenhouse_effect%2C_separated_into_feedback_and_forcing_categories_%28NASA%29.png/220px-

Attribution_of_individual_atmospheric_component_contributions_to_the_terrestrial_greenhouse_effect%2C_separated_into_feedback_and_forcing_categories_%28NASA%29.png)

Schmidt _et al._ (2010)[19] analysed how individual components of the
atmosphere contribute to the total greenhouse effect. They estimated that
water vapor accounts for about 50% of Earth's greenhouse effect, with clouds
contributing 25%, carbon dioxide 20%, and the minor greenhouse gases and
aerosols accounting for the remaining 5%. In the study, the reference model
atmosphere is for 1980 conditions. Image credit: NASA.[20]

The contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is determined by the
characteristics of that gas, its abundance, and any indirect effects it may
cause. For example, the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about
84 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time
frame[21] but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total
direct radiative effect is smaller, in part due to its shorter atmospheric
lifetime. On the other hand, in addition to its direct radiative impact,
methane has a large, indirect radiative effect because it contributes to ozone
formation. Shindell _et al._ (2005)[22] argue that the contribution to climate
change from methane is at least double previous estimates as a result of this
effect.[23]

When ranked by their direct contribution to the greenhouse effect, the most
important are:[17][ _not in citation given_ ]

Compound  
| Formula  
| Concentration in  
atmosphere[24] (ppm) | Contribution  
(%)  
---|---|---|---  
**Water vapor and clouds** | H  
2O | 10–50,000(A) | **36–72%**  
**Carbon dioxide** | CO  
2 | ~400 | **9–26%**  
**Methane** | CH  
4 | ~1.8 | **4–9%**  
**Ozone** | O  
3 | 2–8(B) | **3–7%**  
**notes:**

(A) Water vapor strongly varies locally[25]  
(B) The concentration in stratosphere. About 90% of the ozone in Earth's
atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.

In addition to the main greenhouse gases listed above, other greenhouse gases
include sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons (see IPCC
list of greenhouse gases). Some greenhouse gases are not often listed. For
example, nitrogen trifluoride has a high global warming potential (GWP) but is
only present in very small quantities.[26]

### Proportion of direct effects at a given moment[edit]

It is not possible to state that a certain gas causes an exact percentage of
the greenhouse effect. This is because some of the gases absorb and emit
radiation at the same frequencies as others, so that the total greenhouse
effect is not simply the sum of the influence of each gas. The higher ends of
the ranges quoted are for each gas alone; the lower ends account for overlaps
with the other gases.[17][18] In addition, some gases, such as methane, are
known to have large indirect effects that are still being quantified.[27]

### Atmospheric lifetime[edit]

Aside from water vapor, which has a residence time of about nine days,[28]
major greenhouse gases are well mixed and take many years to leave the
atmosphere.[29] Although it is not easy to know with precision how long it
takes greenhouse gases to leave the atmosphere, there are estimates for the
principal greenhouse gases. Jacob (1999)[30] defines the lifetime τ
{\displaystyle \tau } ![\\tau

its concentration would decrease by about 63%.

The atmospheric lifetime of a species therefore measures the time required to
restore equilibrium following a sudden increase or decrease in its
concentration in the atmosphere. Individual atoms or molecules may be lost or
deposited to sinks such as the soil, the oceans and other waters, or
vegetation and other biological systems, reducing the excess to background
concentrations. The average time taken to achieve this is the mean lifetime.

Carbon dioxide has a variable atmospheric lifetime, and cannot be specified
precisely.[31] The atmospheric lifetime of CO  
2 is estimated of the order of 30–95 years.[32] This figure accounts for CO  
2 molecules being removed from the atmosphere by mixing into the ocean,
photosynthesis, and other processes. However, this excludes the balancing
fluxes of CO  
2 into the atmosphere from the geological reservoirs, which have slower
characteristic rates.[33] Although more than half of the CO  
2 emitted is removed from the atmosphere within a century, some fraction
(about 20%) of emitted CO  
2 remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years.[34] [35] [36] Similar
issues apply to other greenhouse gases, many of which have longer mean
lifetimes than CO  
2, e.g. N2O has a mean atmospheric lifetime of 121 years.[21]

### Radiative forcing[edit]

Earth absorbs some of the radiant energy received from the sun, reflects some
of it as light and reflects or radiates the rest back to space as heat.[37]
Earth's surface temperature depends on this balance between incoming and
outgoing energy.[37] If this energy balance is shifted, Earth's surface
becomes warmer or cooler, leading to a variety of changes in global
climate.[37]

A number of natural and man-made mechanisms can affect the global energy
balance and force changes in Earth's climate.[37] Greenhouse gases are one
such mechanism.[37] Greenhouse gases absorb and emit some of the outgoing
energy radiated from Earth's surface, causing that heat to be retained in the
lower atmosphere.[37] As explained above, some greenhouse gases remain in the
atmosphere for decades or even centuries, and therefore can affect Earth's
energy balance over a long period.[37] Radiative forcing quantifies the effect
of factors that influence Earth's energy balance, including changes in the
concentrations of greenhouse gases.[37] Positive radiative forcing leads to
warming by increasing the net incoming energy, whereas negative radiative
forcing leads to cooling.[37]

### Global warming potential[edit]

The global warming potential (GWP) depends on both the efficiency of the
molecule as a greenhouse gas and its atmospheric lifetime. GWP is measured
relative to the same **mass** of CO  
2 and evaluated for a specific timescale. Thus, if a gas has a high (positive)
radiative forcing but also a short lifetime, it will have a large GWP on a
20-year scale but a small one on a 100-year scale. Conversely, if a molecule
has a longer atmospheric lifetime than CO  
2 its GWP will increase when the timescale is considered. Carbon dioxide is
defined to have a GWP of 1 over all time periods.

Methane has an atmospheric lifetime of 12 ± 3 years. The 2007 IPCC report
lists the GWP as 72 over a time scale of 20 years, 25 over 100 years and 7.6
over 500 years.[38] A 2014 analysis, however, states that although methane's
initial impact is about 100 times greater than that of CO  
2, because of the shorter atmospheric lifetime, after six or seven decades,
the impact of the two gases is about equal, and from then on methane's
relative role continues to decline.[39] The decrease in GWP at longer times is
because methane is degraded to water and CO  
2 through chemical reactions in the atmosphere.

Examples of the atmospheric lifetime and GWP relative to CO  
2 for several greenhouse gases are given in the following table:

The use of CFC-12 (except some essential uses) has been phased out due to its
ozone depleting properties.[40] The phasing-out of less active HCFC-compounds
will be completed in 2030.[41]

Diagram_showing_a_simplified_representation_of_the_Earth%27s_annual_carbon_cycle_%28US_DOE%29.png)

This diagram shows a simplified representation of the contemporary global
carbon cycle. Changes are measured in gigatons of carbon per year (GtC/y).
Canadell _et al._ (2007) estimated the growth rate of global average
atmospheric CO  
2 for 2000–2006 as 1.93 parts-per-million per year (4.1 petagrams of carbon
per year).[45]

Aside from purely human-produced synthetic halocarbons, most greenhouse gases
have both natural and human-caused sources. During the pre-industrial
Holocene, concentrations of existing gases were roughly constant, because the
large natural sources and sinks roughly balanced. In the industrial era, human
activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, mainly through the
burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests.[46][47]

The 2007 Fourth Assessment Report compiled by the IPCC (AR4) noted that
"changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, land
cover and solar radiation alter the energy balance of the climate system", and
concluded that "increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations is
very likely to have caused most of the increases in global average
temperatures since the mid-20th century".[48] In AR4, "most of" is defined as
more than 50%.

400,000 years of ice core data

Ice cores provide evidence for greenhouse gas concentration variations over
the past 800,000 years (see the following section). Both CO  
2 and CH  
4 vary between glacial and interglacial phases, and concentrations of these
gases correlate strongly with temperature. Direct data does not exist for
periods earlier than those represented in the ice core record, a record that
indicates CO  
2 mole fractions stayed within a range of 180 ppm to 280 ppm throughout the
last 800,000 years, until the increase of the last 250 years. However, various
proxies and modeling suggests larger variations in past epochs; 500 million
years ago CO  
2 levels were likely 10 times higher than now.[61] Indeed, higher CO  
2 concentrations are thought to have prevailed throughout most of the
Phanerozoic eon, with concentrations four to six times current concentrations
during the Mesozoic era, and ten to fifteen times current concentrations
during the early Palaeozoic era until the middle of the Devonian period, about
400 Ma.[62][63][64] The spread of land plants is thought to have reduced CO  
2 concentrations during the late Devonian, and plant activities as both
sources and sinks of CO  
2 have since been important in providing stabilising feedbacks.[65] Earlier
still, a 200-million year period of intermittent, widespread glaciation
extending close to the equator (Snowball Earth) appears to have been ended
suddenly, about 550 Ma, by a colossal volcanic outgassing that raised the CO  
2 concentration of the atmosphere abruptly to 12%, about 350 times modern
levels, causing extreme greenhouse conditions and carbonate deposition as
limestone at the rate of about 1 mm per day.[66] This episode marked the close
of the Precambrian eon, and was succeeded by the generally warmer conditions
of the Phanerozoic, during which multicellular animal and plant life evolved.
No volcanic carbon dioxide emission of comparable scale has occurred since. In
the modern era, emissions to the atmosphere from volcanoes are approximately
0.645 billion tons of CO  
2 per year, whereas humans contribute 29 billion tons of CO  
2 each year.[67][66][68][69]

### Ice cores[edit]

Measurements from Antarctic ice cores show that before industrial emissions
started atmospheric CO  
2 mole fractions were about 280 parts per million (ppm), and stayed between
260 and 280 during the preceding ten thousand years.[70] Carbon dioxide mole
fractions in the atmosphere have gone up by approximately 35 percent since the
1900s, rising from 280 parts per million by volume to 387 parts per million in
2009. One study using evidence from stomata of fossilized leaves suggests
greater variability, with carbon dioxide mole fractions above 300 ppm during
the period seven to ten thousand years ago,[71] though others have argued that
these findings more likely reflect calibration or contamination problems
rather than actual CO  
2 variability.[72][73] Because of the way air is trapped in ice (pores in the
ice close off slowly to form bubbles deep within the firn) and the time period
represented in each ice sample analyzed, these figures represent averages of
atmospheric concentrations of up to a few centuries rather than annual or
decadal levels.

Major greenhouse gas trends.

Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the concentrations of most
of the greenhouse gases have increased. For example, the mole fraction of
carbon dioxide has increased from 280 ppm to 400 ppm, or 120 ppm over modern
pre-industrial levels. The first 30 ppm increase took place in about 200
years, from the start of the Industrial Revolution to 1958; however the next
90 ppm increase took place within 56 years, from 1958 to 2014.[74][75]

Recent data also shows that the concentration is increasing at a higher rate.
In the 1960s, the average annual increase was only 37% of what it was in 2000
through 2007.[76]

Total cumulative emissions from 1870 to 2017 were 425±20 GtC (1539 GtCO2) from
fossil fuels and industry, and 180±60 GtC (660 GtCO2) from land use change.
Land-use change, such as deforestation, caused about 31% of cumulative
emissions over 1870–2017, coal 32%, oil 25%, and gas 10%.[77]

Today,[ _when?_ ] the stock of carbon in the atmosphere increases by more than
3 million tonnes per annum (0.04%) compared with the existing stock.[
_clarification needed_ ] This increase is the result of human activities by
burning fossil fuels, deforestation and forest degradation in tropical and
boreal regions.[78]

The other greenhouse gases produced from human activity show similar increases
in both amount and rate of increase. Many observations are available online in
a variety of Atmospheric Chemistry Observational Databases.

Global_Carbon_Emissions.svg.png)

Modern global CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.

Since about 1750 human activity has increased the concentration of carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Measured atmospheric concentrations of
carbon dioxide are currently 100 ppm higher than pre-industrial levels.[81]
Natural sources of carbon dioxide are more than 20 times greater than sources
due to human activity,[82] but over periods longer than a few years natural
sources are closely balanced by natural sinks, mainly photosynthesis of carbon
compounds by plants and marine plankton. As a result of this balance, the
atmospheric mole fraction of carbon dioxide remained between 260 and 280 parts
per million for the 10,000 years between the end of the last glacial maximum
and the start of the industrial era.[83]

It is likely that anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) warming, such as that
due to elevated greenhouse gas levels, has had a discernible influence on many
physical and biological systems.[84] Future warming is projected to have a
range of impacts, including sea level rise,[85] increased frequencies and
severities of some extreme weather events,[85] loss of biodiversity,[86] and
regional changes in agricultural productivity.[86]

The main sources of greenhouse gases due to human activity are:

                    
                                                * burning of fossil fuels and deforestation leading to higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the air. Land use change (mainly deforestation in the tropics) account for up to one third of total anthropogenic CO
                    

2 emissions.[83]

                    
                                                * livestock enteric fermentation and manure management,[87] paddy rice farming, land use and wetland changes, man-made lakes,[88] pipeline losses, and covered vented landfill emissions leading to higher methane atmospheric concentrations. Many of the newer style fully vented septic systems that enhance and target the fermentation process also are sources of atmospheric methane.
                            * use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in refrigeration systems, and use of CFCs and halons in fire suppression systems and manufacturing processes.
                            * agricultural activities, including the use of fertilizers, that lead to higher nitrous oxide (N
                    

2O) concentrations.

The seven sources of CO  
2 from fossil fuel combustion are (with percentage contributions for
2000–2004):[89]

Seven main fossil fuel  
combustion sources | Contribution  
(%)  
---|---  
Liquid fuels (e.g., gasoline, fuel oil) | 36%  
Solid fuels (e.g., coal) | 35%  
Gaseous fuels (e.g., natural gas) | 20%  
Cement production | 3 %  
Flaring gas industrially and at wells | < 1%  
Non-fuel hydrocarbons | < 1%  
"International bunker fuels" of transport  
not included in national inventories[90] | 4 %

Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide (N  
2O) and three groups of fluorinated gases (sulfur hexafluoride (SF  
6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs)) are the major
anthropogenic greenhouse gases,[91]:147[92] and are regulated under the Kyoto
Protocol international treaty, which came into force in 2005.[93] Emissions
limitations specified in the Kyoto Protocol expired in 2012.[93] The Cancún
agreement, agreed on in 2010, includes voluntary pledges made by 76 countries
to control emissions.[94] At the time of the agreement, these 76 countries
were collectively responsible for 85% of annual global emissions.[94]

Although CFCs are greenhouse gases, they are regulated by the Montreal
Protocol, which was motivated by CFCs' contribution to ozone depletion rather
than by their contribution to global warming. Note that ozone depletion has
only a minor role in greenhouse warming, though the two processes often are
confused in the media. On 15 October 2016, negotiators from over 170 nations
meeting at the summit of the United Nations Environment Programme reached a
legally binding accord to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in an amendment
to the Montreal Protocol.[95][96][97]

This figure shows the relative fraction of anthropogenic greenhouse gases
coming from each of eight categories of sources, as estimated by the Emission
Database for Global Atmospheric Research version 4.2, fast track 2010 project.
These values are intended to provide a snapshot of global annual greenhouse
gas emissions in the year 2010. The top panel shows the sum over all
anthropogenic greenhouse gases, weighted by their global warming potential
over the next 100 years. This consists of 72% carbon dioxide, 20% methane, 5%
nitrous oxide and 3% other gases. Lower panels show the comparable information
for each of these three primary greenhouse gases, with the same coloring of
sectors as used in the top chart. Segments with less than 1% fraction are not
labeled.

#### Tourism[edit]

According to UNEP global tourism is closely linked to climate change. Tourism
is a significant contributor to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere. Tourism accounts for about 50% of traffic movements.
Rapidly expanding air traffic contributes about 2.5% of the production of CO  
2. The number of international travelers is expected to increase from 594 million in 1996 to 1.6 billion by 2020, adding greatly to the problem unless steps are taken to reduce emissions.[98]

#### Trucking and haulage[edit]

The trucking and haulage industry plays a part in production of CO  
2, contributing around 20% of the UK's total carbon emissions a year, with
only the energy industry having a larger impact at around 39%.[99] Average
carbon emissions within the haulage industry are falling—in the thirty-year
period from 1977 to 2007, the carbon emissions associated with a 200-mile
journey fell by 21 percent; NOx emissions are also down 87 percent, whereas
journey times have fallen by around a third.[100] Due to their size, HGVs
often receive criticism regarding their CO2 emissions; however, rapid
development in engine technology and fuel management is having a largely
positive effect.

#### Plastic[edit]

Plastic is produced mainly from Fossil fuels. Plastic manufacturing is
estimated to use 8 percent of yearly global oil production. The EPA estimates
as many as five ounces of carbon dioxide are emitted for each ounce of
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) produced—the type of plastic most commonly
used for beverage bottles,[101] the transportation produce greenhouse gases
also.[102] Plastic waste emits carbon dioxide when it degrades. In 2018
research claimed that some of the most common plastics in the environment
release the greenhouse gases methane and ethylene when exposed to sunlight in
an amount that can affect the earth climate.[103][104]

From the other side, if it is placed in a landfill, it becomes a carbon
sink[105] although biodegradable plastics have caused methane emissions. [106]
Due to the lightness of plastic versus glass or metal, plastic may reduce
energy consumption. For example, packaging beverages in PET plastic rather
than glass or metal is estimated to save 52% in transportation energy, if the
glass or metal package is single use, of course.

In 2019 a new report "Plastic and Climate" was published. According to the
report plastic will contribute greenhouse gases in the equivalent of 850
million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere in 2019. In current
trend, annual emissions will grow to 1.34 billion tons by 2030. By 2050
plastic could emit 56 billion tons of Greenhouse gas emissions, as much as 14
percent of the Earth's remaining carbon budget.[107] The report says that only
solutions which involve a reduction in consumption can solve the problem,
while others like biodegradable plastic, ocean cleanup, using renewable energy
in plastic industry can do little, and in some cases may even worsen it.[108]

## Role of water vapor[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/BAMS_climate_assess_boulder_water_vapor_2002.png/330px-

BAMS_climate_assess_boulder_water_vapor_2002.png)

Increasing water vapor in the stratosphere at Boulder, Colorado.

Water vapor accounts for the largest percentage of the greenhouse effect,
between 36% and 66% for clear sky conditions and between 66% and 85% when
including clouds.[18] Water vapor concentrations fluctuate regionally, but
human activity does not directly affect water vapor concentrations except at
local scales, such as near irrigated fields. Indirectly, human activity that
increases global temperatures will increase water vapor concentrations, a
process known as water vapor feedback.[109] The atmospheric concentration of
vapor is highly variable and depends largely on temperature, from less than
0.01% in extremely cold regions up to 3% by mass in saturated air at about 32
°C.[110] (See Relative humidity#other important facts.)

The average residence time of a water molecule in the atmosphere is only about
nine days, compared to years or centuries for other greenhouse gases such as
CH  
4 and CO  
2.[111] Thus, water vapor responds to and amplifies effects of the other
greenhouse gases. The Clausius–Clapeyron relation establishes that more water
vapor will be present per unit volume at elevated temperatures. This and other
basic principles indicate that warming associated with increased
concentrations of the other greenhouse gases also will increase the
concentration of water vapor (assuming that the relative humidity remains
approximately constant; modeling and observational studies find that this is
indeed so). Because water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this results in further
warming and so is a "positive feedback" that amplifies the original warming.
Eventually other earth processes offset these positive feedbacks, stabilizing
the global temperature at a new equilibrium and preventing the loss of Earth's
water through a Venus-like runaway greenhouse effect.[112]

## Direct greenhouse gas emissions[edit]

Between the period 1970 to 2004, greenhouse gas emissions (measured in CO  
2-equivalent)[113] increased at an average rate of 1.6% per year, with CO  
2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels growing at a rate of 1.9% per
year.[114][115] Total anthropogenic emissions at the end of 2009 were
estimated at 49.5 gigatonnes CO  
2-equivalent.[116]:15 These emissions include CO  
2 from fossil fuel use and from land use, as well as emissions of methane,
nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol.

At present, the primary source of CO  
2 emissions is the burning of coal, natural gas, and petroleum for electricity
and heat.[117]

### Regional and national attribution of emissions[edit]

See also: Kyoto Protocol and government action

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), GHG emissions in the
United States can be traced from different sectors.

There are several different ways of measuring greenhouse gas emissions, for
example, see World Bank (2010)[118]:362 for tables of national emissions data.
Some variables that have been reported[119] include:

                    
                                                * Definition of measurement boundaries: Emissions can be attributed geographically, to the area where they were emitted (the territory principle) or by the activity principle to the territory produced the emissions. These two principles result in different totals when measuring, for example, electricity importation from one country to another, or emissions at an international airport.
                            * Time horizon of different gases: Contribution of a given greenhouse gas is reported as a CO
                    

2 equivalent. The calculation to determine this takes into account how long
that gas remains in the atmosphere. This is not always known accurately and
calculations must be regularly updated to reflect new information.

                    
                                                * What sectors are included in the calculation (e.g., energy industries, industrial processes, agriculture etc.): There is often a conflict between transparency and availability of data.
                            * The measurement protocol itself: This may be via direct measurement or estimation. The four main methods are the emission factor-based method, mass balance method, predictive emissions monitoring systems, and continuous emissions monitoring systems. These methods differ in accuracy, cost, and usability.
                    

These different measures are sometimes used by different countries to assert
various policy/ethical positions on climate change (Banuri _et al._ , 1996, p.
94).[120] The use of different measures leads to a lack of comparability,
which is problematic when monitoring progress towards targets. There are
arguments for the adoption of a common measurement tool, or at least the
development of communication between different tools.[119]

Emissions may be measured over long time periods. This measurement type is
called historical or cumulative emissions. Cumulative emissions give some
indication of who is responsible for the build-up in the atmospheric
concentration of greenhouse gases (IEA, 2007, p. 199).[121]

The national accounts balance would be positively related to carbon emissions.
The national accounts balance shows the difference between exports and
imports. For many richer nations, such as the United States, the accounts
balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported.
This is mostly due to the fact that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of
developed countries, leading the economies of developed countries to become
increasingly dependent on services and not goods. We believed that a positive
accounts balance would means that more production was occurring in a country,
so more factories working would increase carbon emission levels.[122]

Emissions may also be measured across shorter time periods. Emissions changes
may, for example, be measured against a base year of 1990. 1990 was used in
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the base
year for emissions, and is also used in the Kyoto Protocol (some gases are
also measured from the year 1995).[91]:146, 149 A country's emissions may also
be reported as a proportion of global emissions for a particular year.

Another measurement is of per capita emissions. This divides a country's total
annual emissions by its mid-year population.[118]:370 Per capita emissions may
be based on historical or annual emissions (Banuri _et al._ , 1996, pp.
106–07).[120]

While cities are sometimes considered to be disproportionate contributors to
emissions, per-capita emissions tend to be lower for cities than the averages
in their countries.[123]

### From land-use change[edit]

![Refer to

Greenhouse_gas_emissions_from_agriculture%2C_forestry_and_other_land_use%2C_1970-2010.png)

Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use,
1970–2010.

Land-use change, e.g., the clearing of forests for agricultural use, can
affect the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by altering how
much carbon flows out of the atmosphere into carbon sinks.[124] Accounting for
land-use change can be understood as an attempt to measure "net" emissions,
i.e., gross emissions from all sources minus the removal of emissions from the
atmosphere by carbon sinks (Banuri _et al._ , 1996, pp. 92–93).[120]

There are substantial uncertainties in the measurement of net carbon
emissions.[125] Additionally, there is controversy over how carbon sinks
should be allocated between different regions and over time (Banuri _et al._ ,
1996, p. 93).[120] For instance, concentrating on more recent changes in
carbon sinks is likely to favour those regions that have deforested earlier,
e.g., Europe.

Greenhouse gas intensity is a ratio between greenhouse gas emissions and
another metric, e.g., gross domestic product (GDP) or energy use. The terms
"carbon intensity" and "emissions intensity" are also sometimes used.[126]
Emission intensities may be calculated using market exchange rates (MER) or
purchasing power parity (PPP) (Banuri _et al._ , 1996, p. 96).[120]
Calculations based on MER show large differences in intensities between
developed and developing countries, whereas calculations based on PPP show
smaller differences.

Cumulative anthropogenic (i.e., human-emitted) emissions of CO  
2 from fossil fuel use are a major cause of global warming,[127] and give some
indication of which countries have contributed most to human-induced climate
change.[128]:15

---|---|---

OECD Europe | 26.1 | 16.6  
Former USSR | 14.1 | 12.5  
China | 5.5 | 6.0  
Eastern Europe | 5.5 | 4.8

The table above to the left is based on Banuri _et al._ (1996, p. 94).[120]
Overall, developed countries accounted for 83.8% of industrial CO  
2 emissions over this time period, and 67.8% of total CO  
2 emissions. Developing countries accounted for industrial CO  
2 emissions of 16.2% over this time period, and 32.2% of total CO  
2 emissions. The estimate of total CO  
2 emissions includes biotic carbon emissions, mainly from deforestation.
Banuri _et al._ (1996, p. 94)[120] calculated per capita cumulative emissions
based on then-current population. The ratio in per capita emissions between
industrialized countries and developing countries was estimated at more than
10 to 1.

Including biotic emissions brings about the same controversy mentioned earlier
regarding carbon sinks and land-use change (Banuri _et al._ , 1996, pp.
93–94).[120] The actual calculation of net emissions is very complex, and is
affected by how carbon sinks are allocated between regions and the dynamics of
the climate system.

Non-OECD countries accounted for 42% of cumulative energy-related CO  
2 emissions between 1890 and 2007.[129]:179–80 Over this time period, the US
accounted for 28% of emissions; the EU, 23%; Russia, 11%; China, 9%; other
OECD countries, 5%; Japan, 4%; India, 3%; and the rest of the world,
18%.[129]:179–80

### Changes since a particular base year[edit]

See also: Kyoto Protocol § Government action and emissions

Between 1970 and 2004, global growth in annual CO  
2 emissions was driven by North America, Asia, and the Middle East.[130] The
sharp acceleration in CO  
2 emissions since 2000 to more than a 3% increase per year (more than 2 ppm
per year) from 1.1% per year during the 1990s is attributable to the lapse of
formerly declining trends in carbon intensity of both developing and developed
nations. China was responsible for most of global growth in emissions during
this period. Localised plummeting emissions associated with the collapse of
the Soviet Union have been followed by slow emissions growth in this region
due to more efficient energy use, made necessary by the increasing proportion
of it that is exported.[89] In comparison, methane has not increased
appreciably, and N  
2O by 0.25% y−1.

Using different base years for measuring emissions has an effect on estimates
of national contributions to global warming.[128]:17–18[131] This can be
calculated by dividing a country's highest contribution to global warming
starting from a particular base year, by that country's minimum contribution
to global warming starting from a particular base year. Choosing between
different base years of 1750, 1900, 1950, and 1990 has a significant effect
for most countries.[128]:17–18 Within the G8 group of countries, it is most
significant for the UK, France and Germany. These countries have a long
history of CO  
2 emissions (see the section on Cumulative and historical emissions).

### Annual emissions[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/GHG_per_capita_2000.svg/220px-

GHG_per_capita_2000.svg.png)

Per capita anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by country for the year 2000
including land-use change.

Annual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as
much as ten times the average in developing countries.[91]:144 Due to China's
fast economic development, its annual per capita emissions are quickly
approaching the levels of those in the Annex I group of the Kyoto Protocol
(i.e., the developed countries excluding the US).[132] Other countries with
fast growing emissions are South Korea, Iran, and Australia (which apart from
the oil rich Persian Gulf states, now has the highest percapita emission rate
in the world). On the other hand, annual per capita emissions of the EU-15 and
the US are gradually decreasing over time.[132] Emissions in Russia and
Ukraine have decreased fastest since 1990 due to economic restructuring in
these countries.[133]

Energy statistics for fast growing economies are less accurate than those for
the industrialized countries. For China's annual emissions in 2008, the
Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency estimated an uncertainty range of
about 10%.[132]

The greenhouse gas footprint refers to the emissions resulting from the
creation of products or services. It is more comprehensive than the commonly
used carbon footprint, which measures only carbon dioxide, one of many
greenhouse gases.

2015 was the first year to see both total global economic growth and a
reduction of carbon emissions.[134]

### Embedded emissions[edit]

One way of attributing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is to measure the
embedded emissions (also referred to as "embodied emissions") of goods that
are being consumed. Emissions are usually measured according to production,
rather than consumption.[136] For example, in the main international treaty on
climate change (the UNFCCC), countries report on emissions produced within
their borders, e.g., the emissions produced from burning fossil
fuels.[129]:179[137]:1 Under a production-based accounting of emissions,
embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the exporting, rather
than the importing, country. Under a consumption-based accounting of
emissions, embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the
importing country, rather than the exporting, country.

Davis and Caldeira (2010)[137]:4 found that a substantial proportion of CO  
2 emissions are traded internationally. The net effect of trade was to export
emissions from China and other emerging markets to consumers in the US, Japan,
and Western Europe. Based on annual emissions data from the year 2004, and on
a per-capita consumption basis, the top-5 emitting countries were found to be
(in tCO  
2 per person, per year): Luxembourg (34.7), the US (22.0), Singapore (20.2),
Australia (16.7), and Canada (16.6).[137]:5 Carbon Trust research revealed
that approximately 25% of all CO  
2 emissions from human activities 'flow' (i.e., are imported or exported) from
one country to another. Major developed economies were found to be typically
net importers of embodied carbon emissions—with UK consumption emissions 34%
higher than production emissions, and Germany (29%), Japan (19%) and the US
(13%) also significant net importers of embodied emissions.[138]

### Effect of policy[edit]

See also: Kyoto Protocol and government action

Governments have taken action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (climate
change mitigation). Assessments of policy effectiveness have included work by
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,[139] International Energy
Agency,[140][141] and United Nations Environment Programme.[142] Policies
implemented by governments have included[143][144][145] national and regional
targets to reduce emissions, promoting energy efficiency, and support for
renewable energy such as Solar energy as an effective use of renewable energy
because solar uses energy from the sun and does not release pollutants into
the air.

Countries and regions listed in Annex I of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (i.e., the OECD and former planned
economies of the Soviet Union) are required to submit periodic assessments to
the UNFCCC of actions they are taking to address climate change.[145]:3
Analysis by the UNFCCC (2011)[145]:8 suggested that policies and measures
undertaken by Annex I Parties may have produced emission savings of 1.5
thousand Tg CO  
2-eq in the year 2010, with most savings made in the energy sector. The
projected emissions saving of 1.5 thousand Tg CO  
2-eq is measured against a hypothetical "baseline" of Annex I emissions, i.e.,
projected Annex I emissions in the absence of policies and measures. The total
projected Annex I saving of 1.5 thousand CO  
2-eq does not include emissions savings in seven of the Annex I
Parties.[145]:8

### Projections[edit]

Further information: climate change scenario § Quantitative emissions
projections

See also: Global climate model § Projections of future climate change

A wide range of projections of future emissions have been produced.[146]
Rogner _et al._ (2007)[147] assessed the scientific literature on greenhouse
gas projections. Rogner _et al._ (2007)[114] concluded that unless energy
policies changed substantially, the world would continue to depend on fossil
fuels until 2025–2030. Projections suggest that more than 80% of the world's
energy will come from fossil fuels. This conclusion was based on "much
evidence" and "high agreement" in the literature.[114] Projected annual
energy-related CO  
2 emissions in 2030 were 40–110% higher than in 2000, with two-thirds of the
increase originating in developing countries.[114] Projected annual per capita
emissions in developed country regions remained substantially lower (2.8–5.1
tonnes CO  
2) than those in developed country regions (9.6–15.1 tonnes CO  
2).[148] Projections consistently showed increase in annual world emissions of
"Kyoto" gases,[149] measured in CO  
2-equivalent) of 25–90% by 2030, compared to 2000.[114]

### Relative CO

2 emission from various fuels[edit]

One liter of gasoline, when used as a fuel, produces 2.32 kg (about 1300
liters or 1.3 cubic meters) of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. One US gallon
produces 19.4 lb (1,291.5 gallons or 172.65 cubic feet)[150][151][152]

## Removal from the atmosphere[edit]

### Natural processes[edit]

Greenhouse gases can be removed from the atmosphere by various processes, as a
consequence of:

                    
                                                * a physical change (condensation and precipitation remove water vapor from the atmosphere).
                            * a chemical reaction within the atmosphere. For example, methane is oxidized by reaction with naturally occurring hydroxyl radical, OH **·** and degraded to  CO
                    

2 and water vapor (CO  
2 from the oxidation of methane is not included in the methane Global warming
potential). Other chemical reactions include solution and solid phase
chemistry occurring in atmospheric aerosols.

                    
                                                * a physical exchange between the atmosphere and the other compartments of the planet. An example is the mixing of atmospheric gases into the oceans.
                            * a chemical change at the interface between the atmosphere and the other compartments of the planet. This is the case for CO
                    

2, which is reduced by photosynthesis of plants, and which, after dissolving
in the oceans, reacts to form carbonic acid and bicarbonate and carbonate ions
(see ocean acidification).

                    
                                                * a photochemical change. Halocarbons are dissociated by UV light releasing Cl **·** and F **·** as free radicals in the stratosphere with harmful effects on ozone (halocarbons are generally too stable to disappear by chemical reaction in the atmosphere).
                    

### Negative emissions[edit]

Main article: Negative carbon dioxide emission

A number of technologies remove greenhouse gases emissions from the
atmosphere. Most widely analysed are those that remove carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere, either to geologic formations such as bio-energy with carbon
capture and storage[155][156][157] and carbon dioxide air capture,[157] or to
the soil as in the case with biochar.[157] The IPCC has pointed out that many
long-term climate scenario models require large-scale manmade negative
emissions to avoid serious climate change.[158]

## History of scientific research[edit]

In the late 19th century scientists experimentally discovered that N  
2 and O  
2 do not absorb infrared radiation (called, at that time, "dark radiation"),
while water (both as true vapor and condensed in the form of microscopic
droplets suspended in clouds) and CO  
2 and other poly-atomic gaseous molecules do absorb infrared radiation. In the
early 20th century researchers realized that greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere made Earth's overall temperature higher than it would be without
them. During the late 20th century, a scientific consensus evolved that
increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere cause a
substantial rise in global temperatures and changes to other parts of the
climate system,[159] with consequences for the environment and for human
health.

Referred to by: Blasing, T.J. (February 2013), _Current Greenhouse Gas Concentrations_, doi:10.3334/CDIAC/atg.032 , on Blasing, T.J. 2013. Based on Blasing _et al._ (2013): Pre-1750 concentrations of CH4,N2O and current concentrations of O3, are taken from Table 4.1 (a) of the IPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), 2001. Following the convention of IPCC (2001), inferred global-scale trace-gas concentrations from prior to 1750 are assumed to be practically uninfluenced by human activities such as increasingly specialized agriculture, land clearing, and combustion of fossil fuels. Preindustrial concentrations of industrially manufactured compounds are given as zero. The short atmospheric lifetime of ozone (hours-days) together with the spatial variability of its sources precludes a globally or vertically homogeneous distribution, so that a fractional unit such as parts per billion would not apply over a range of altitudes or geographical locations. Therefore a different unit is used to integrate the varying concentrations of ozone in the vertical dimension over a unit area, and the results can then be averaged globally. This unit is called a Dobson Unit (D.U.), after G.M.B. Dobson, one of the first investigators of atmospheric ozone. A Dobson unit is the amount of ozone in a column that, unmixed with the rest of the atmosphere, would be 10 micrometers thick at standard temperature and pressure.
                            51. **^** Because atmospheric concentrations of most gases tend to vary systematically over the course of a year, figures given represent averages over a 12-month period for all gases except ozone (O3), for which a current global value has been estimated (IPCC, 2001, Table 4.1a).
