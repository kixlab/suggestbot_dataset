## Risk of Pregnancy

**_What is my risk of getting pregnant if I have sex without using
contraception or my birth control fails?_**

Almost any time you have sex without using birth control effectively, there 's
a chance you might get pregnant - and using emergency contraceptive pills
(also called "morning after pills" or "day after pills") can significantly
reduce your risk. Your chances of getting pregnant if you have unprotected sex
and don't use emergency contraception afterwards vary, depending on where you
are in your monthly cycle. Researchers have calculated the average risk at
different times in a woman's monthly cycle, but it's important to remember
that your risk could be higher or lower. The risk is highest on the days right
before you ovulate (when your ovaries release the egg), reaching a maximum of
nearly 30%. You can't know for sure when you will ovulate, so researchers have
calculated the _average risk_ of pregnancy based on a woman 's monthly cycle
(since you can figure out when you started your last period).

During the first two days of a woman's cycle (day 1 being your first day of
bleeding), the average risk of pregnancy is virtually zero. After the first
two days, the risk starts to rise steadily, reaching 9% on or about day 13.
Then it begins to decline slowly until it levels off at about 1% on day 25. It
stays at about 1% for the rest of your cycle. (The average monthly cycle lasts
29 days, but it is perfectly normal to have a cycle that lasts as little as 20
days or less or as long as 40 days or more.)

Emergency contraception works before ovulation, but does not appear to work
after ovulation has already occurred. _ella_ works closer to the time of
ovulation than progestin-only pills, like _Plan B One-Step_ or _Next Choice
One Dose._ Therefore, if you believe that you have had unprotected sex close
to the time of ovulation, it might be best to use _ella_ if possible. But it
can take time to get a prescription and fill it - the most important thing is
to take action as soon as possible after unprotected sex.

If you've had unprotected sex and are wondering if you at risk of pregnancy,
this tool from Planned Parenthood can help.

A thorough and up-to-date academic review of the medical and social science
literature on emergency contraception, including how it reduces the risk of
pregnancy after sex, is available here ![](../images/pdf.jpg).
