## Bush as businessman

### How the Texas governor made his millions

#### Brooks Jackson/CNN

_**May 13, 1999**  
Web posted at: 6:00 p.m. EDT (2200 GMT)_

ARLINGTON, Texas (May 13) -- In Austin, Texas, not everyone admires Gov.
George W. Bush.

Radio host Jim Hightower is one such Bush critic. "He says he's a
compassionate conservative," Hightower said. "I say he's a crony capitalist."

"Crony capitalist?" Maybe. Multi-millionaire? Certainly.

Bush started in the Texas oil business, after Yale University and Harvard
Business School. Wealthy family friends and others invested millions with him,
but with poor results. A 1985 disclosure shows Bush's track record: Investors
got back only 45 cents on the dollar, but few complained.

Investors also got tax deductions averaging more than 80 cents on every dollar
invested. Those early Bush ventures were mainly tax shelters.

When his father was president, there were suspicions that the Persian Gulf
nation of Bahrain tried to enrich the younger Bush. Bahrain granted an
exclusive drilling contract to Harken Energy Corporation, in which the younger
Bush held stock. But he says he opposed the deal.

Bush spokesperson Karen Hughes says, "He felt the company just was not large
enough, that it was outside the scope of their experience." And the deal
turned out to be a loser, abandoned after two expensive dry holes.

In 1990 Bush unloaded most of his Harken shares for $835,000 about two months
before Harken announced a big loss. That triggered an investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission into possible insider trading by Bush, but
the SEC took no action.

A look at Harken's stock price may show why: Bush sold for $4 a share. Harken
stock did dip to $2.38 the day after the bad earnings were released, but four
days later bounced right back to $4 a share, exactly what Bush had been paid.

And the stock kept rising: Bush attorney Robert Jordan said, "A year later, in
fact, the value had doubled to $8 a share."

So Bush could have done much better if he had waited.

Bush did not make his fortune in the oil fields. He made it at a major-league
ball park heavily subsidized by taxpayers.

Bush takes credit for conceiving The Ballpark at Arlington, home of the Texas
Rangers baseball team, which he bought in 1989 with a wealthy group of
investors. Among them: billionaire Richard Rainwater of Fort Worth.

Bush invested just over $600,000, but Arlington taxpayers invested a lot more.

"It was $135 million worth of sales tax money," said attorney Glenn Sodd. "The
city donated a good bit of land to the project. They got a sales tax exemption
on all the items that were purchased for the stadium. We have a property tax
in Texas and they were given as part of the deal a property tax exemption." A
total of at least $200 million, according to Sodd.

And there's more: Sodd sued the Rangers on behalf of two families whose
property was seized for stadium parking. A jury found they were paid about
one-seventh of what the land was worth.

But the Rangers defend the deal.

"Basically, what we think we did was to create a model public-private
partnership in which both sides came out ahead," said Bush partner and Rangers
President Tom Schieffer.

Bush declined to be interviewed, but Schieffer says taxpayers got their
money's worth.

"That's what we have always said in this process: 'If this wasn't good for
Arlington, don't do it.' And that's the way we took it to the voters,"
Schieffer said. "We said, 'This is going to be good for the Rangers, no
question about it. This is going to be good for us. But if it's not going to
be good for you, don't do it.'"

The team threatened to move, and Arlington taxpayers voted in a half-cent
increase in the sales tax. The vote was 2-to-1.

The new, subsidized stadium turned out to be a great deal for Bush. He was the
most visible partner, and the publicity helped launch him into the
governorship in 1994. And when the team was sold last year Bush's share came
to at least $14.9 million with perhaps another $1 million or $2 million still
to come.

Jim Runzheimer is one Arlington resident who opposed the deal.

"He put $600,000 into this project and he did a little bit better than Hillary
Clinton," Runzheimer said. "She only made ... $100,000 or $200,000, from her
dealing in commodities. Gov. Bush has made $15 million."

Fans love the stadium. And the team has flourished financially.

"Looking at it from the perspective of a businessman, this was an awfully
sweet deal for the business," said Sodd. "Looking at it as a public official,
we think it's lousy policy to use government money to subsidize billionaires
in the pursuit of their business interests."

So Bush the businessman did prosper. But not by his bootstraps -- with help
from wealthy friends and taxpayer subsidies.
