# Primary Care at Planned Parenthood

**What is Primary Care?**

Primary care is a term describing basic health care services that an
individual might need for general health concerns. A primary care provider is
often the first doctor a patient might see for such issues. A patient may be
referred to a specialist (another type of doctor) for more complicated health
conditions.
