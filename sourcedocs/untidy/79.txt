# Slideshow: Fetal Development Month by Month

![Human fetus in utero at 8

## Your Baby's Growth: Conception to Birth

You're pregnant. Congratulations! Are you curious how big your developing baby
is, what your baby looks like as it grows inside you, and when you'll feel it
move? Take a peek inside the womb to see how a baby develops from month to
month.

**Swipe to advance**

![sperm fertilizing

2 / 13

## Conception

Fertilization happens when a sperm meets and penetrates an egg. It's also
called conception. At this moment, the genetic makeup is complete, including
the sex of the baby. Within about three days after conception, the fertilized
egg is dividing very fast into many cells. It passes through the fallopian
tube into the uterus, where it attaches to the uterine wall. The placenta,
which will nourish the baby, also starts to form.

3 / 13

## Development at 4 Weeks

At this point the baby is developing the structures that will eventually form
his face and neck. The heart and blood vessels continue to develop. And the
lungs, stomach, and liver start to develop. A home pregnancy test would show
positive.

4 / 13

## Development at 8 Weeks

The baby is now a little over half an inch in size. Eyelids and ears are
forming, and you can see the tip of the nose. The arms and legs are well
formed. The fingers and toes grow longer and more distinct.

**Swipe to advance**

![Human fetus in utero at 12

5 / 13

## Development at 12 Weeks

The baby measures about 2 inches and starts to make its own movements. You may
start to feel the top of your uterus above your pubic bone. Your doctor may
hear the baby's heartbeat with special instruments. The sex organs of the baby
should start to become clear.

**Swipe to advance**

![Human fetus in utero at 16

6 / 13

## Development at 16 Weeks

The baby now measures about 4.3 to 4.6 inches and weighs about 3.5 ounces. You
should be able to feel the top of your uterus about 3 inches below your belly
button. The baby's eyes can blink and the heart and blood vessels are fully
formed. The baby's fingers and toes have fingerprints.

7 / 13

## Development at 20 Weeks

The baby weighs about 10 ounces and is a little more than 6 inches long. Your
uterus should be at the level of your belly button. The baby can suck a thumb,
yawn, stretch, and make faces. Soon -- if you haven't already -- you'll feel
your baby move, which is called "quickening."

## Time for an Ultrasound

An ultrasound is usually done for all pregnant women at 20 weeks. During this
ultrasound, the doctor will make sure that the placenta is healthy and
attached normally and that your baby is growing properly. You can see the
baby's heartbeat and movement of its body, arms, and legs on the ultrasound.
You can usually find out whether it's a boy or a girl at 20 weeks.

_Shown here is a 2D ultrasound (inset) contrasted with a 4D ultrasound, both
at 20 weeks._

## Development at 24 Weeks

The baby weighs about 1.4 pounds now and responds to sounds by moving or
increasing his pulse. You may notice jerking motions if he hiccups. With the
inner ear fully developed, the baby may be able to sense being upside down in
the womb.

10 / 13

## Development at 28 Weeks

The baby weighs about 2 pounds, 6 ounces, and changes position often at this
point in pregnancy. If you had to deliver prematurely now, there is a good
chance the baby would survive. Ask your doctor about preterm labor warning
signs. Now is the time to register for birthing classes. Birthing classes
prepare you for many aspects of childbirth, including labor and delivery and
taking care of your newborn.

11 / 13

## Development at 32 Weeks

The baby weighs almost 4 pounds and is moving around often. The baby's skin
has fewer wrinkles as a layer of fat starts to form under the skin. Between
now and delivery, your baby will gain up to half his birth weight. Ask your
doctor how to do a fetal movement chart. Think about breastfeeding. You may
notice a yellowish fluid leaking from your breasts. That is colostrum, and it
happens to get your breasts ready for making milk. Most women go to the doctor
every two weeks at this stage of pregnancy.

weeks](https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/fetal_development_slideshow/nilsson_rm_photo_36_week_fetus.jpg)

12 / 13

## Development at 36 Weeks

Babies differ in size, depending on many factors, such as gender, the number
of babies being carried, and size of the parents. So your baby's overall rate
of growth is as important as the actual size. On average, a baby at this stage
is about 18.5 inches and weighs close to 6 pounds. The brain has been
developing rapidly. Lungs are nearly fully developed. The head is usually
positioned down into the pelvis by now. Your baby is considered at 'term' when
he is 37 weeks. He is an early term baby if born between 37-39 weeks, at term,
if he's 39-40 weeks and late term if he's 41-42 weeks.

## Birth!

A mother's due date marks the end of her 40th week. The delivery date is
calculated using the first day of her last period. Based on this, pregnancy
can last between 38 and 42 weeks with a full-term delivery happening around 40
weeks. Some post-term pregnancies -- those lasting more than 42 weeks -- are
not really late. The due date may just not be accurate. For safety reasons,
most babies are delivered by 42 weeks. Sometimes the doctor may need to induce
labor.
