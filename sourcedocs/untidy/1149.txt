# Pot Smoke: Less Carcinogenic Than Tobacco?

Researchers Say THC May Curb Cancer-Causing Effects of Marijuana Smoke

From the WebMD Archives

Oct. 17, 2005 -- Although tobacco smoke and marijuana smoke are chemically
very similar, a new report argues that their cancer-causing effects may be
very different.

Both tobacco and cannabis smoke contain the same cancer-causing compounds
(carcinogens). Depending on what part of the plant is smoked, marijuana can
contain more of these harmful ingredients.

But a recent review of studies on the effects of marijuana and tobacco smoke
suggests that the cancer-promoting effects of these ingredients is increased
by the tobacco in nicotine and reduced by the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) found
in cannabis.

Previous studies have shown that THC can inhibit carcinogens in mice, and the
report suggests it may have the same protective effect against the carcinogens
found in smoke in humans. But researchers warn that even if THC lessens the
effects of these cancer-causing ingredients, cannabis smoke remains
carcinogenic.

## The Role of THC

In the article, published in _Harm Reduction Journal_ , researcher Robert
Melamede, PhD, of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, argues that
tobacco smoke and marijuana smoke are not equally cancer-causing.

Research shows that nicotine and THC act on related pathways in the body, but
they bind to different receptors to activate these pathways. For example,
Melamede says the cells of the lungs are lined with nicotine receptors but do
not appear to contain receptors for THC.

He says that may explain why marijuana use has not been linked to lung cancer
as cigarette smoking has.

However, Melamede says the effects of cannabis and cannabis-like compounds are
complex and sometimes contradictory. The long-term effects of marijuana on an
aging population of users are not known; the effects may become similar to
what we see with tobacco. Also, marijuana is frequently used in combination
with tobacco and the two drugs may interact in yet unknown ways.
