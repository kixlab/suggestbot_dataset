An **ice age** is a long period of reduction in the temperature of the Earth's
surface and atmosphere, resulting in the presence or expansion of continental
and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers. Earth is currently in the Quaternary
glaciation, known in popular terminology as the **Ice Age**.[1] Individual
pulses of cold climate are termed "glacial periods" (or, alternatively,
"glacials", "glaciations", "glacial stages", "stadials", "stades", or
colloquially, "ice ages"), and intermittent warm periods are called
"interglacials" or "interstadials" with both climatic pulses part of the
Quaternary or other periods in Earth's history.[2]

In the terminology of glaciology, _ice age_ implies the presence of extensive
ice sheets in both northern and southern hemispheres.[3] By this definition,
we are in an interglacial period—the Holocene. The amount of heat trapping
gases emitted into Earth's Oceans and atmosphere will prevent the next ice
age, which otherwise would begin in around 50,000 years, and likely more
glacial cycles.[4][5]

In 1742, Pierre Martel (1706–1767), an engineer and geographer living in
Geneva, visited the valley of Chamonix in the Alps of Savoy.[6][7] Two years
later he published an account of his journey. He reported that the inhabitants
of that valley attributed the dispersal of erratic boulders to the glaciers,
saying that they had once extended much farther.[8][9] Later similar
explanations were reported from other regions of the Alps. In 1815 the
carpenter and chamois hunter Jean-Pierre Perraudin (1767–1858) explained
erratic boulders in the Val de Bagnes in the Swiss canton of Valais as being
due to glaciers previously extending further.[10] An unknown woodcutter from
Meiringen in the Bernese Oberland advocated a similar idea in a discussion
with the Swiss-German geologist Jean de Charpentier (1786–1855) in 1834.[11]
Comparable explanations are also known from the Val de Ferret in the Valais
and the Seeland in western Switzerland[12] and in Goethe's scientific
work.[13] Such explanations could also be found in other parts of the world.
When the Bavarian naturalist Ernst von Bibra (1806–1878) visited the Chilean
Andes in 1849–1850, the natives attributed fossil moraines to the former
action of glaciers.[14]

Meanwhile, European scholars had begun to wonder what had caused the dispersal
of erratic material. From the middle of the 18th century, some discussed ice
as a means of transport. The Swedish mining expert Daniel Tilas (1712–1772)
was, in 1742, the first person to suggest drifting sea ice in order to explain
the presence of erratic boulders in the Scandinavian and Baltic regions.[15]
In 1795, the Scottish philosopher and gentleman naturalist, James Hutton
(1726–1797), explained erratic boulders in the Alps by the action of
glaciers.[16] Two decades later, in 1818, the Swedish botanist Göran
Wahlenberg (1780–1851) published his theory of a glaciation of the
Scandinavian peninsula. He regarded glaciation as a regional phenomenon.[17]

Only a few years later, the Danish-Norwegian geologist Jens Esmark (1762–1839)
argued a sequence of worldwide ice ages. In a paper published in 1824, Esmark
proposed changes in climate as the cause of those glaciations. He attempted to
show that they originated from changes in Earth's orbit.[18] During the
following years, Esmark's ideas were discussed and taken over in parts by
Swedish, Scottish and German scientists. At the University of Edinburgh Robert
Jameson (1774–1854) seemed to be relatively open to Esmark's ideas, as
reviewed by Norwegian professor of glaciology Bjørn G. Andersen (1992).[19]
Jameson's remarks about ancient glaciers in Scotland were most probably
prompted by Esmark.[20] In Germany, Albrecht Reinhard Bernhardi (1797–1849), a
geologist and professor of forestry at an academy in Dreissigacker, since
incorporated in the southern Thuringian city of Meiningen, adopted Esmark's
theory. In a paper published in 1832, Bernhardi speculated about former polar
ice caps reaching as far as the temperate zones of the globe.[21]

In 1829, independently of these debates, the Swiss civil engineer Ignaz Venetz
(1788–1859) explained the dispersal of erratic boulders in the Alps, the
nearby Jura Mountains, and the North German Plain as being due to huge
glaciers. When he read his paper before the Schweizerische Naturforschende
Gesellschaft, most scientists remained sceptical.[22] Finally, Venetz
convinced his friend Jean de Charpentier. De Charpentier transformed Venetz's
idea into a theory with a glaciation limited to the Alps. His thoughts
resembled Wahlenberg's theory. In fact, both men shared the same volcanistic,
or in de Charpentier's case rather plutonistic assumptions, about the Earth's
history. In 1834, de Charpentier presented his paper before the Schweizerische
Naturforschende Gesellschaft.[23] In the meantime, the German botanist Karl
Friedrich Schimper (1803–1867) was studying mosses which were growing on
erratic boulders in the alpine upland of Bavaria. He began to wonder where
such masses of stone had come from. During the summer of 1835 he made some
excursions to the Bavarian Alps. Schimper came to the conclusion that ice must
have been the means of transport for the boulders in the alpine upland. In the
winter of 1835 to 1836 he held some lectures in Munich. Schimper then assumed
that there must have been global times of obliteration ("Verödungszeiten")
with a cold climate and frozen water.[24] Schimper spent the summer months of
1836 at Devens, near Bex, in the Swiss Alps with his former university friend
Louis Agassiz (1801–1873) and Jean de Charpentier. Schimper, de Charpentier
and possibly Venetz convinced Agassiz that there had been a time of
glaciation. During the winter of 1836/37, Agassiz and Schimper developed the
theory of a sequence of glaciations. They mainly drew upon the preceding works
of Venetz, de Charpentier and on their own fieldwork. Agassiz appears to have
been already familiar with Bernhardi's paper at that time.[25] At the
beginning of 1837, Schimper coined the term "ice age" ( _"Eiszeit"_ ) for the
period of the glaciers.[26] In July 1837 Agassiz presented their synthesis
before the annual meeting of the Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft
at Neuchâtel. The audience was very critical and some opposed to the new
theory because it contradicted the established opinions on climatic history.
Most contemporary scientists thought that the Earth had been gradually cooling
down since its birth as a molten globe.[27]

In order to overcome this rejection, Agassiz embarked on geological fieldwork.
He published his book _Study on Glaciers_ ("Études sur les glaciers") in
1840.[28] De Charpentier was put out by this, as he had also been preparing a
book about the glaciation of the Alps. De Charpentier felt that Agassiz should
have given him precedence as it was he who had introduced Agassiz to in-depth
glacial research.[29] Besides that, Agassiz had, as a result of personal
quarrels, omitted any mention of Schimper in his book.[30]

All together, it took several decades until the ice age theory was fully
accepted by scientists. This happened on an international scale in the second
half of the 1870s following the work of James Croll, including the publication
of _Climate and Time, in Their Geological Relations_ in 1875, which provided a
credible explanation for the causes of ice ages.[31]

## Evidence for ice ages

There are three main types of evidence for ice ages: geological, chemical, and
paleontological.

**Geological** evidence for ice ages comes in various forms, including rock
scouring and scratching, glacial moraines, drumlins, valley cutting, and the
deposition of till or tillites and glacial erratics. Successive glaciations
tend to distort and erase the geological evidence, making it difficult to
interpret. Furthermore, this evidence was difficult to date exactly; early
theories assumed that the glacials were short compared to the long
interglacials. The advent of sediment and ice cores revealed the true
situation: glacials are long, interglacials short. It took some time for the
current theory to be worked out.

The **chemical** evidence mainly consists of variations in the ratios of
isotopes in fossils present in sediments and sedimentary rocks and ocean
sediment cores. For the most recent glacial periods ice cores provide climate
proxies from their ice, and atmospheric samples from included bubbles of air.
Because water containing heavier isotopes has a higher heat of evaporation,
its proportion decreases with colder conditions.[32] This allows a temperature
record to be constructed. This evidence can be confounded, however, by other
factors recorded by isotope ratios.

The **paleontological** evidence consists of changes in the geographical
distribution of fossils. During a glacial period cold-adapted organisms spread
into lower latitudes, and organisms that prefer warmer conditions become
extinct or are squeezed into lower latitudes. This evidence is also difficult
to interpret because it requires (1) sequences of sediments covering a long
period of time, over a wide range of latitudes and which are easily
correlated; (2) ancient organisms which survive for several million years
without change and whose temperature preferences are easily diagnosed; and (3)
the finding of the relevant fossils.

Despite the difficulties, analysis of ice core and ocean sediment cores[33]
has shown periods of glacials and interglacials over the past few million
years. These also confirm the linkage between ice ages and continental crust
phenomena such as glacial moraines, drumlins, and glacial erratics. Hence the
continental crust phenomena are accepted as good evidence of earlier ice ages
when they are found in layers created much earlier than the time range for
which ice cores and ocean sediment cores are available.

There have been at least five major ice ages in the Earth's history (the
Huronian, Cryogenian, Andean-Saharan, late Paleozoic, and the latest
Quaternary Ice Age). Outside these ages, the Earth seems to have been ice free
even in high latitudes.[34][35]

stage); blue: Elster glacial maximum glaciation.

Rocks from the earliest well established ice age, called the Huronian, formed
around 2.4 to 2.1 Ga (billion years) ago during the early Proterozoic Eon.
Several hundreds of km of the Huronian Supergroup are exposed 10–100 km north
of the north shore of Lake Huron extending from near Sault Ste. Marie to
Sudbury, northeast of Lake Huron, with giant layers of now-lithified till
beds, dropstones, varves, outwash, and scoured basement rocks. Correlative
Huronian deposits have been found near Marquette, Michigan, and correlation
has been made with Paleoproterozoic glacial deposits from Western Australia.
The Huronian ice age was caused by the elimination of atmospheric methane, a
greenhouse gas, during the Great Oxygenation Event.[36]

The next well-documented ice age, and probably the most severe of the last
billion years, occurred from 720 to 630 million years ago (the Cryogenian
period) and may have produced a Snowball Earth in which glacial ice sheets
reached the equator,[37] possibly being ended by the accumulation of
greenhouse gases such as CO  
2 produced by volcanoes. "The presence of ice on the continents and pack ice
on the oceans would inhibit both silicate weathering and photosynthesis, which
are the two major sinks for CO  
2 at present."[38] It has been suggested that the end of this ice age was
responsible for the subsequent Ediacaran and Cambrian explosion, though this
model is recent and controversial.

The Andean-Saharan occurred from 460 to 420 million years ago, during the Late
Ordovician and the Silurian period.

Sediment records showing the fluctuating sequences of glacials and
interglacials during the last several million years.

The evolution of land plants at the onset of the Devonian period caused a long
term increase in planetary oxygen levels and reduction of CO  
2 levels, which resulted in the late Paleozoic icehouse. Its former name, the
Karoo glaciation, was named after the glacial tills found in the Karoo region
of South Africa. There were extensive polar ice caps at intervals from 360 to
260 million years ago in South Africa during the Carboniferous and early
Permian Periods. Correlatives are known from Argentina, also in the center of
the ancient supercontinent Gondwanaland.

The Quaternary Glaciation / Quaternary Ice Age started about 2.58 million
years ago at the beginning of the Quaternary Period when the spread of ice
sheets in the Northern Hemisphere began. Since then, the world has seen cycles
of glaciation with ice sheets advancing and retreating on 40,000- and
100,000-year time scales called glacial periods, glacials or glacial advances,
and interglacial periods, interglacials or glacial retreats. The earth is
currently in an interglacial, and the last glacial period ended about 10,000
years ago. All that remains of the continental ice sheets are the Greenland
and Antarctic ice sheets and smaller glaciers such as on Baffin Island.

The definition of the Quaternary as beginning 2.58 Ma is based on the
formation of the Arctic ice cap. The Antarctic ice sheet began to form
earlier, at about 34 Ma, in the mid-Cenozoic (Eocene-Oligocene Boundary). The
term Late Cenozoic Ice Age is used to include this early phase.[39]

Ice ages can be further divided by location and time; for example, the names
_Riss_ (180,000–130,000 years bp) and _Würm_ (70,000–10,000 years bp) refer
specifically to glaciation in the Alpine region. The maximum extent of the ice
is not maintained for the full interval. The scouring action of each
glaciation tends to remove most of the evidence of prior ice sheets almost
completely, except in regions where the later sheet does not achieve full
coverage.

Within the ice ages (or at least within the current one), more temperate and
more severe periods occur. The colder periods are called _glacial periods_ ,
the warmer periods _interglacials_ , such as the Eemian Stage.

Glacials are characterized by cooler and drier climates over most of the earth
and large land and sea ice masses extending outward from the poles. Mountain
glaciers in otherwise unglaciated areas extend to lower elevations due to a
lower snow line. Sea levels drop due to the removal of large volumes of water
above sea level in the icecaps. There is evidence that ocean circulation
patterns are disrupted by glaciations. Since the earth has significant
continental glaciation in the Arctic and Antarctic, we are currently in a
glacial minimum of a glaciation. Such a period between glacial maxima is known
as an _interglacial_. The glacials and interglacials also coincided with
changes in Earth's orbit called Milankovitch cycles.

The earth has been in an interglacial period known as the Holocene for around
11,700 years,[40] and an article in _Nature_ in 2004 argues that it might be
most analogous to a previous interglacial that lasted 28,000 years.[41]
Predicted changes in orbital forcing suggest that the next glacial period
would begin at least 50,000 years from now, due to the Milankovitch cycles.
Moreover, anthropogenic forcing from increased greenhouse gases is estimated
to potentially outweigh the orbital forcing of the Milankovitch cycles for
hundreds of thousand of years.[42][5][4]

## Positive and negative feedback in glacial periods

Each glacial period is subject to positive feedback which makes it more
severe, and negative feedback which mitigates and (in all cases so far)
eventually ends it.

### Positive feedback processes

Ice and snow increase Earth's albedo, i.e. they make it reflect more of the
sun's energy and absorb less. Hence, when the air temperature decreases, ice
and snow fields grow, and this continues until competition with a negative
feedback mechanism forces the system to an equilibrium. Also, the reduction in
forests caused by the ice's expansion increases albedo.

Another theory proposed by Ewing and Donn in 1956[43] hypothesized that an
ice-free Arctic Ocean leads to increased snowfall at high latitudes. When low-
temperature ice covers the Arctic Ocean there is little evaporation or
sublimation and the polar regions are quite dry in terms of precipitation,
comparable to the amount found in mid-latitude deserts. This low precipitation
allows high-latitude snowfalls to melt during the summer. An ice-free Arctic
Ocean absorbs solar radiation during the long summer days, and evaporates more
water into the Arctic atmosphere. With higher precipitation, portions of this
snow may not melt during the summer and so glacial ice can form at lower
altitudes _and_ more southerly latitudes, reducing the temperatures over land
by increased albedo as noted above. Furthermore, under this hypothesis the
lack of oceanic pack ice allows increased exchange of waters between the
Arctic and the North Atlantic Oceans, warming the Arctic and cooling the North
Atlantic. (Current projected consequences of global warming include a largely
ice-free Arctic Ocean within 5–20 years, see Arctic shrinkage.) Additional
fresh water flowing into the North Atlantic during a warming cycle may also
reduce the global ocean water circulation. Such a reduction (by reducing the
effects of the Gulf Stream) would have a cooling effect on northern Europe,
which in turn would lead to increased low-latitude snow retention during the
summer. It has also been suggested that during an extensive glacial, glaciers
may move through the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, extending into the North Atlantic
Ocean far enough to block the Gulf Stream.

### Negative feedback processes

Ice sheets that form during glaciations cause erosion of the land beneath
them. After some time, this will reduce land above sea level and thus diminish
the amount of space on which ice sheets can form. This mitigates the albedo
feedback, as does the lowering in sea level that accompanies the formation of
ice sheets.[ _citation needed_ ]

Another factor is the increased aridity occurring with glacial maxima, which
reduces the precipitation available to maintain glaciation. The glacial
retreat induced by this or any other process can be amplified by similar
inverse positive feedbacks as for glacial advances.[44]

According to research published in _Nature Geoscience_ , human emissions of
carbon dioxide (CO2) will defer the next ice age. Researchers used data on
Earth's orbit to find the historical warm interglacial period that looks most
like the current one and from this have predicted that the next ice age would
usually begin within 1,500 years. They go on to say that emissions have been
so high that it will not.[45]

## Causes

The causes of ice ages are not fully understood for either the large-scale ice
age periods or the smaller ebb and flow of glacial–interglacial periods within
an ice age. The consensus is that several factors are important: atmospheric
composition, such as the concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane (the
specific levels of the previously mentioned gases are now able to be seen with
the new ice core samples from EPICA Dome C in Antarctica over the past 800,000
years); changes in the earth's orbit around the Sun known as Milankovitch
cycles; the motion of tectonic plates resulting in changes in the relative
location and amount of continental and oceanic crust on the earth's surface,
which affect wind and ocean currents; variations in solar output; the orbital
dynamics of the Earth–Moon system; the impact of relatively large meteorites
and volcanism including eruptions of supervolcanoes.[46][ _citation needed_ ]

Some of these factors influence each other. For example, changes in Earth's
atmospheric composition (especially the concentrations of greenhouse gases)
may alter the climate, while climate change itself can change the atmospheric
composition (for example by changing the rate at which weathering removes CO  
2).

Maureen Raymo, William Ruddiman and others propose that the Tibetan and
Colorado Plateaus are immense CO  
2 "scrubbers" with a capacity to remove enough CO  
2 from the global atmosphere to be a significant causal factor of the 40
million year Cenozoic Cooling trend. They further claim that approximately
half of their uplift (and CO  
2 "scrubbing" capacity) occurred in the past 10 million years.[47][48]

### Changes in Earth's atmosphere

There is evidence that greenhouse gas levels fell at the start of ice ages and
rose during the retreat of the ice sheets, but it is difficult to establish
cause and effect (see the notes above on the role of weathering). Greenhouse
gas levels may also have been affected by other factors which have been
proposed as causes of ice ages, such as the movement of continents and
volcanism.

The Snowball Earth hypothesis maintains that the severe freezing in the late
Proterozoic was ended by an increase in CO  
2 levels in the atmosphere, mainly from volcanoes, and some supporters of
Snowball Earth argue that it was caused in the first place by a reduction in
atmospheric CO  
2. The hypothesis also warns of future Snowball Earths. 

In 2009, further evidence was provided that changes in solar insolation
provide the initial trigger for the earth to warm after an Ice Age, with
secondary factors like increases in greenhouse gases accounting for the
magnitude of the change.[49]

#### Human-induced changes

There is considerable evidence that over the very recent period of the last
100–1000 years, the sharp increases in human activity, especially the burning
of fossil fuels, has caused the parallel sharp and accelerating increase in
atmospheric greenhouse gases which trap the sun's heat. The consensus theory
of the scientific community is that the resulting greenhouse effect is a
principal cause of the increase in global warming which has occurred over the
same period, and a chief contributor to the accelerated melting of the
remaining glaciers and polar ice. A 2012 investigation finds that dinosaurs
released methane through digestion in a similar amount to humanity's current
methane release, which "could have been a key factor" to the very warm climate
150 million years ago.[50]

William Ruddiman has proposed the early anthropocene hypothesis, according to
which the anthropocene era, as some people call the most recent period in the
earth's history when the activities of the human species first began to have a
significant global impact on the earth's climate and ecosystems, did not begin
in the 18th century with the advent of the Industrial Era, but dates back to
8,000 years ago, due to intense farming activities of our early agrarian
ancestors. It was at that time that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations
stopped following the periodic pattern of the Milankovitch cycles. In his
overdue-glaciation hypothesis Ruddiman states that an incipient glacial would
probably have begun several thousand years ago, but the arrival of that
scheduled glacial was forestalled by the activities of early farmers.[51]

At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (December 17, 2008), scientists
detailed evidence in support of the controversial idea that the introduction
of large-scale rice agriculture in Asia, coupled with extensive deforestation
in Europe began to alter world climate by pumping significant amounts of
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere over the last 1,000 years. In turn, a
warmer atmosphere heated the oceans making them much less efficient
storehouses of carbon dioxide and reinforcing global warming, possibly
forestalling the onset of a new glacial age.[52]

### Position of the continents

The geological record appears to show that ice ages start when the continents
are in positions which block or reduce the flow of warm water from the equator
to the poles and thus allow ice sheets to form. The ice sheets increase
Earth's reflectivity and thus reduce the absorption of solar radiation. With
less radiation absorbed the atmosphere cools; the cooling allows the ice
sheets to grow, which further increases reflectivity in a positive feedback
loop. The ice age continues until the reduction in weathering causes an
increase in the greenhouse effect.

There are three main contributors from the layout of the continents that
obstruct the movement of warm water to the poles:[ _citation needed_ ]

                
                                      * A continent sits on top of a pole, as Antarctica does today.
                      * A polar sea is almost land-locked, as the Arctic Ocean is today.
                      * A supercontinent covers most of the equator, as Rodinia did during the Cryogenian period.
                

Since today's Earth has a continent over the South Pole and an almost land-
locked ocean over the North Pole, geologists believe that Earth will continue
to experience glacial periods in the geologically near future.

Some scientists believe that the Himalayas are a major factor in the current
ice age, because these mountains have increased Earth's total rainfall and
therefore the rate at which carbon dioxide is washed out of the atmosphere,
decreasing the greenhouse effect.[48] The Himalayas' formation started about
70 million years ago when the Indo-Australian Plate collided with the Eurasian
Plate, and the Himalayas are still rising by about 5 mm per year because the
Indo-Australian plate is still moving at 67 mm/year. The history of the
Himalayas broadly fits the long-term decrease in Earth's average temperature
since the mid-Eocene, 40 million years ago.

### Fluctuations in ocean currents

Another important contribution to ancient climate regimes is the variation of
**ocean currents** , which are modified by continent position, sea levels and
salinity, as well as other factors. They have the ability to cool (e.g. aiding
the creation of Antarctic ice) and the ability to warm (e.g. giving the
British Isles a temperate as opposed to a boreal climate). The closing of the
Isthmus of Panama about 3 million years ago may have ushered in the present
period of strong glaciation over North America by ending the exchange of water
between the tropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.[53]

Analyses suggest that ocean current fluctuations can adequately account for
recent glacial oscillations. During the last glacial period the sea-level has
fluctuated 20–30 m as water was sequestered, primarily in the Northern
Hemisphere ice sheets. When ice collected and the sea level dropped
sufficiently, flow through the Bering Strait (the narrow strait between
Siberia and Alaska is about 50 m deep today) was reduced, resulting in
increased flow from the North Atlantic. This realigned the thermohaline
circulation in the Atlantic, increasing heat transport into the Arctic, which
melted the polar ice accumulation and reduced other continental ice sheets.
The release of water raised sea levels again, restoring the ingress of colder
water from the Pacific with an accompanying shift to northern hemisphere ice
accumulation.[54]

### Uplift of the Tibetan plateau and surrounding mountain areas above the

snowline

Matthias Kuhle's geological theory of Ice Age development was suggested by the
existence of an ice sheet covering the Tibetan Plateau during the Ice Ages
(Last Glacial Maximum?). According to Kuhle, the plate-tectonic uplift of
Tibet past the snow-line has led to a surface of c. 2,400,000 square
kilometres (930,000 sq mi) changing from bare land to ice with a 70% greater
albedo. The reflection of energy into space resulted in a global cooling,
triggering the Pleistocene Ice Age. Because this highland is at a subtropical
latitude, with 4 to 5 times the insolation of high-latitude areas, what would
be Earth's strongest heating surface has turned into a cooling surface.

Kuhle explains the interglacial periods by the 100,000-year cycle of radiation
changes due to variations in Earth's orbit. This comparatively insignificant
warming, when combined with the lowering of the Nordic inland ice areas and
Tibet due to the weight of the superimposed ice-load, has led to the repeated
complete thawing of the inland ice areas.[55][56][57][58]

### Variations in Earth's orbit (Milankovitch cycles)

The Milankovitch cycles are a set of cyclic variations in characteristics of
the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Each cycle has a different length, so at
some times their effects reinforce each other and at other times they
(partially) cancel each other.

SummerSolstice65N-future.png)

Past and future of daily average insolation at top of the atmosphere on the
day of the summer solstice, at 65 N latitude.

There is strong evidence that the Milankovitch cycles affect the occurrence of
glacial and interglacial periods within an ice age. The present ice age is the
most studied and best understood, particularly the last 400,000 years, since
this is the period covered by ice cores that record atmospheric composition
and proxies for temperature and ice volume. Within this period, the match of
glacial/interglacial frequencies to the Milanković orbital forcing periods is
so close that orbital forcing is generally accepted. The combined effects of
the changing distance to the Sun, the precession of the Earth's axis, and the
changing tilt of the Earth's axis redistribute the sunlight received by the
Earth. Of particular importance are changes in the tilt of the Earth's axis,
which affect the intensity of seasons. For example, the amount of solar influx
in July at 65 degrees north latitude varies by as much as 22% (from 450 W/m²
to 550 W/m²). It is widely believed that ice sheets advance when summers
become too cool to melt all of the accumulated snowfall from the previous
winter. Some believe that the strength of the orbital forcing is too small to
trigger glaciations, but feedback mechanisms like CO  
2 may explain this mismatch.

While Milankovitch forcing predicts that cyclic changes in the Earth's orbital
elements can be expressed in the glaciation record, additional explanations
are necessary to explain which cycles are observed to be most important in the
timing of glacial–interglacial periods. In particular, during the last 800,000
years, the dominant period of glacial–interglacial oscillation has been
100,000 years, which corresponds to changes in Earth's orbital eccentricity
and orbital inclination. Yet this is by far the weakest of the three
frequencies predicted by Milankovitch. During the period 3.0–0.8 million years
ago, the dominant pattern of glaciation corresponded to the 41,000-year period
of changes in Earth's obliquity (tilt of the axis). The reasons for dominance
of one frequency versus another are poorly understood and an active area of
current research, but the answer probably relates to some form of resonance in
the Earth's climate system. Recent work suggests that the 100K year cycle
dominates due to increased southern-pole sea-ice increasing total solar
reflectivity.[59][60]

The "traditional" Milankovitch explanation struggles to explain the dominance
of the 100,000-year cycle over the last 8 cycles. Richard A. Muller, Gordon J.
F. MacDonald,[61][62][63] and others have pointed out that those calculations
are for a two-dimensional orbit of Earth but the three-dimensional orbit also
has a 100,000-year cycle of orbital inclination. They proposed that these
variations in orbital inclination lead to variations in insolation, as the
Earth moves in and out of known dust bands in the solar system. Although this
is a different mechanism to the traditional view, the "predicted" periods over
the last 400,000 years are nearly the same. The Muller and MacDonald theory,
in turn, has been challenged by Jose Antonio Rial.[64]

Another worker, William Ruddiman, has suggested a model that explains the
100,000-year cycle by the modulating effect of eccentricity (weak 100,000-year
cycle) on precession (26,000-year cycle) combined with greenhouse gas
feedbacks in the 41,000- and 26,000-year cycles. Yet another theory has been
advanced by Peter Huybers who argued that the 41,000-year cycle has always
been dominant, but that the Earth has entered a mode of climate behavior where
only the second or third cycle triggers an ice age. This would imply that the
100,000-year periodicity is really an illusion created by averaging together
cycles lasting 80,000 and 120,000 years.[65] This theory is consistent with a
simple empirical multi-state model proposed by Didier Paillard.[66] Paillard
suggests that the late Pleistocene glacial cycles can be seen as jumps between
three quasi-stable climate states. The jumps are induced by the orbital
forcing, while in the early Pleistocene the 41,000-year glacial cycles
resulted from jumps between only two climate states. A dynamical model
explaining this behavior was proposed by Peter Ditlevsen.[67] This is in
support of the suggestion that the late Pleistocene glacial cycles are not due
to the weak 100,000-year eccentricity cycle, but a non-linear response to
mainly the 41,000-year obliquity cycle.

### Variations in the Sun's energy output

There are at least two types of variation in the Sun's energy output

                
                                      * In the very long term, astrophysicists believe that the Sun's output increases by about 7% every one billion (109) years.
                      * Shorter-term variations such as sunspot cycles, and longer episodes such as the Maunder Minimum, which occurred during the coldest part of the Little Ice Age.
                

The long-term increase in the Sun's output cannot be a cause of ice ages.

### Volcanism

Volcanic eruptions may have contributed to the inception and/or the end of ice
age periods. At times during the paleoclimate, carbon dioxide levels were two
or three times greater than today. Volcanoes and movements in continental
plates contributed to high amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide
from volcanoes probably contributed to periods with highest overall
temperatures.[68] One suggested explanation of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal
Maximum is that undersea volcanoes released methane from clathrates and thus
caused a large and rapid increase in the greenhouse effect.[69] There appears
to be no geological evidence for such eruptions at the right time, but this
does not prove they did not happen.

## Recent glacial and interglacial phases

Main article: Timeline of glaciation

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Northern_icesheet_hg.png/280px-

Northern_icesheet_hg.png)

Northern hemisphere glaciation during the last ice ages. The setup of 3 to 4
kilometer thick ice sheets caused a sea level lowering of about 120 m.

The current geological period, the Quaternary, which began about 2.6 million
years ago and extends into the present,[2] is marked by warm and cold
episodes, cold phases called glacials (Quaternary ice age) lasting about
100,000 years, and which are then interrupted by the warmer interglacials
which lasted about 10,000–15,000 years. The last cold episode of the last
glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago.[70] Earth is currently in an
interglacial period of the Quaternary, called the Holocene.

### Glacial stages in North America

The major glacial stages of the current ice age in North America are the
Illinoian, Eemian and Wisconsin glaciation. The use of the Nebraskan, Afton,
Kansan, and Yarmouthian stages to subdivide the ice age in North America has
been discontinued by Quaternary geologists and geomorphologists. These stages
have all been merged into the Pre-Illinoian in the 1980s.[71][72][73]

During the most recent North American glaciation, during the latter part of
the Last Glacial Maximum (26,000 to 13,300 years ago), ice sheets extended to
about 45th parallel north. These sheets were 3 to 4 kilometres (1.9 to 2.5 mi)
thick.[72]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Glacial_lakes.jpg/220px-

Glacial_lakes.jpg)

Stages of proglacial lake development in the region of the current North
American Great Lakes.

This Wisconsin glaciation left widespread impacts on the North American
landscape. The Great Lakes and the Finger Lakes were carved by ice deepening
old valleys. Most of the lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin were gouged out by
glaciers and later filled with glacial meltwaters. The old Teays River
drainage system was radically altered and largely reshaped into the Ohio River
drainage system. Other rivers were dammed and diverted to new channels, such
as Niagara Falls, which formed a dramatic waterfall and gorge, when the
waterflow encountered a limestone escarpment. Another similar waterfall, at
the present Clark Reservation State Park near Syracuse, New York, is now dry.

The area from Long Island to Nantucket, Massachusetts was formed from glacial
till, and the plethora of lakes on the Canadian Shield in northern Canada can
be almost entirely attributed to the action of the ice. As the ice retreated
and the rock dust dried, winds carried the material hundreds of miles, forming
beds of loess many dozens of feet thick in the Missouri Valley. Post-glacial
rebound continues to reshape the Great Lakes and other areas formerly under
the weight of the ice sheets.

The Driftless Area, a portion of western and southwestern Wisconsin along with
parts of adjacent Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois, was not covered by glaciers.

### Last Glacial Period in the semiarid Andes around Aconcagua and Tupungato

A specially interesting climatic change during glacial times has taken place
in the semi-arid Andes. Beside the expected cooling down in comparison with
the current climate, a significant precipitation change happened here. So,
researches in the presently semiarid subtropic Aconcagua-massif (6,962 m) have
shown an unexpectedly extensive glacial glaciation of the type "ice stream
network".[74][75][76][77][78] The connected valley glaciers exceeding 100 km
in length, flowed down on the East-side of this section of the Andes at
32–34°S and 69–71°W as far as a height of 2,060 m and on the western luff-side
still clearly deeper.[78][79] Where current glaciers scarcely reach 10 km in
length, the snowline (ELA) runs at a height of 4,600 m and at that time was
lowered to 3,200 m asl, i.e. about 1,400 m. From this follows that—beside of
an annual depression of temperature about c. 8.4 °C— here was an increase in
precipitation. Accordingly, at glacial times the humid climatic belt that
today is situated several latitude degrees further to the S, was shifted much
further to the N.[77][78]

## Effects of glaciation

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Scandinavia.TMO2003050.jpg/220px-

Scandinavia.TMO2003050.jpg)

Scandinavia exhibits some of the typical effects of ice age glaciation such as
fjords and lakes.

See also: Glacial landform

Although the last glacial period ended more than 8,000 years ago, its effects
can still be felt today. For example, the moving ice carved out the landscape
in Canada (See Canadian Arctic Archipelago), Greenland, northern Eurasia and
Antarctica. The erratic boulders, till, drumlins, eskers, fjords, kettle
lakes, moraines, cirques, horns, etc., are typical features left behind by the
glaciers.

The weight of the ice sheets was so great that they deformed the Earth's crust
and mantle. After the ice sheets melted, the ice-covered land rebounded. Due
to the high viscosity of the Earth's mantle, the flow of mantle rocks which
controls the rebound process is very slow—at a rate of about 1 cm/year near
the center of rebound area today.

During glaciation, water was taken from the oceans to form the ice at high
latitudes, thus global sea level dropped by about 110 meters, exposing the
continental shelves and forming land-bridges between land-masses for animals
to migrate. During deglaciation, the melted ice-water returned to the oceans,
causing sea level to rise. This process can cause sudden shifts in coastlines
and hydration systems resulting in newly submerged lands, emerging lands,
collapsed ice dams resulting in salination of lakes, new ice dams creating
vast areas of freshwater, and a general alteration in regional weather
patterns on a large but temporary scale. It can even cause temporary
reglaciation. This type of chaotic pattern of rapidly changing land, ice,
saltwater and freshwater has been proposed as the likely model for the Baltic
and Scandinavian regions, as well as much of central North America at the end
of the last glacial maximum, with the present-day coastlines only being
achieved in the last few millennia of prehistory. Also, the effect of
elevation on Scandinavia submerged a vast continental plain that had existed
under much of what is now the North Sea, connecting the British Isles to
Continental Europe.[80]

The redistribution of ice-water on the surface of the Earth and the flow of
mantle rocks causes changes in the gravitational field as well as changes to
the distribution of the moment of inertia of the Earth. These changes to the
moment of inertia result in a change in the angular velocity, axis, and wobble
of the Earth's rotation.

The weight of the redistributed surface mass loaded the lithosphere, caused it
to flex and also induced stress within the Earth. The presence of the glaciers
generally suppressed the movement of faults below.[81][82][83] During
deglaciation, the faults experience accelerated slip triggering earthquakes.
Earthquakes triggered near the ice margin may in turn accelerate ice calving
and may account for the Heinrich events.[84] As more ice is removed near the
ice margin, more intraplate earthquakes are induced and this positive feedback
may explain the fast collapse of ice sheets.

In Europe, glacial erosion and isostatic sinking from weight of ice made the
Baltic Sea, which before the Ice Age was all land drained by the Eridanos
River.
