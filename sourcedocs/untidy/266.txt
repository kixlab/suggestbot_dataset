### Picture of First Trimester (8 Weeks)

First Trimester: The Baby at 8 Weeks

                
                                      * All major organs and external body structures have begun to form. 
                      * Your baby's heart beats with a regular rhythm. 
                      * The arms and legs grow longer, and fingers and toes have begun to form. 
                      * The sex organs begin to form. 
                      * The eyes have moved forward on the face and eyelids have formed. 
                      * The umbilical cord is clearly visible. 
                      * At the end of 8 weeks, your baby is a fetus and looks more like a human. Your baby is nearly 1 inch long and weighs less than 1/8 of an ounce.
