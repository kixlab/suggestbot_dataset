<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>In November 2012 the states of Colorado and Washington approved
ballot initiatives that legalized marijuana for recreational use
under state law. Two years later, Alaska and Oregon followed
suit.<sup><a href="#cite-1">1</a></sup> In November 2016 as many as
11 other states will likely consider similar measures, through
either ballot initiative or state legislative action.<sup><a href=
"#cite-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Supporters and critics make numerous claims about the effects of
state-level marijuana legalization. Advocates think that
legalization reduces crime, raises revenue, lowers criminal justice
expenditure, improves public health, improves traffic safety, and
stimulates the economy.<sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup> Critics
argue that legalization spurs marijuana and other drug or alcohol
use, increases crime, diminishes traffic safety, harms public
health, and lowers teen educational achievement.<sup><a href=
"#cite-4">4</a></sup> Systematic evaluation of those claims after
legalization, however, has been limited, particularly for Oregon
and Alaska.<sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>This paper assesses the effect to date of marijuana legalization
and related policies in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and
Alaska.</p>
<p>Each of those four legalizations occurred recently, and each
rolled out gradually over several years. The data available for
before and after comparisons are therefore limited, so our
assessments of legalization&rsquo;s effect are tentative. Yet some
post-legalization data are available, and considerable data exist
regarding earlier marijuana policy changes&mdash;such as
legalization for medical purposes&mdash;that plausibly have similar
effects. Thus available information provides a useful if incomplete
perspective on what other states should expect from legalization or
related policies. Going forward, additional data may allow stronger
conclusions.</p>
<p>Our analysis compares the pre- and post-policy-change paths of
marijuana use, other drug or alcohol use, marijuana prices, crime,
traffic accidents, teen educational outcomes, public health, tax
revenues, criminal justice expenditures, and economic outcomes.
These comparisons indicate whether the outcomes display obvious
changes in trend around the time of changes in marijuana
policy.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that state-level marijuana legalizations to
date have been associated with, at most, modest changes in
marijuana use and related outcomes. Our estimates cannot rule out
small changes, and related literature finds some effects from
earlier marijuana policy changes such as medicalization. But the
strong claims about legalization made by both opponents and
supporters are not apparent in the data. The absence of significant
adverse consequences is especially striking given the sometimes
dire predictions made by legalization opponents.</p>
<p>The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section
outlines the recent changes in marijuana policy in the four states
of interest and discusses the timing of those changes. Subsequent
sections examine the behavior of marijuana use and related outcomes
before and after those policy changes. A final section summarizes
and discusses implications for upcoming legalization debates.</p>

<h2><a name="sec-2" id="sec-2"></a><strong>History of State-Level
Marijuana Legalizations</strong></h2>
<p>Until 1913 marijuana was legal throughout the United States
under both state and federal law.<sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>
Beginning with California in 1913 and Utah in 1914, however, states
began outlawing marijuana, and by 1930, 30 states had adopted
marijuana prohibition.<sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup> Those
state-level prohibitions stemmed largely from anti-immigrant
sentiment and in particular racial prejudice against Mexican
migrant workers, who were often associated with use of the drug.
Prohibition advocates attributed terrible crimes to marijuana and
the Mexicans who smoked it, creating a stigma around marijuana and
its purported &ldquo;vices.&rdquo;<sup><a href=
"#cite-8">8</a></sup></p>
 Meanwhile, film productions like Reefer Madness (1936) presented
marijuana as &ldquo;Public Enemy Number One&rdquo; and suggested
that its consumption could lead to insanity, death, and even
homicidal tendencies.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>
<p>Starting in 1930, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics pushed states
to adopt the Uniform State Narcotic Act and to enact their own
measures to control marijuana distribution.<sup><a href=
"#cite-10">10</a></sup> Following the model of the National
Firearms Act, in 1937 Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act, which
effectively outlawed marijuana under federal law by imposing a
prohibitive tax; even stricter federal laws followed
thereafter.<sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup> The 1952 Boggs Act
and 1956 Narcotics Control Act established mandatory sentences for
drug-related violations; a first-time offense for marijuana
possession carried a minimum sentence of 2 to 10 years in prison
and a fine of up to $20,000.<sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>
Those mandatory sentences were mostly repealed in the early 1970s
but reinstated by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act under President Ronald
Reagan. The current controlling federal legislation is the
Controlled Substances Act, which classifies marijuana as Schedule
I. This category is for drugs that, according to the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA), have &ldquo;no currently accepted
medical use and a high potential for abuse&rdquo; as well as a risk
of &ldquo;potentially severe psychological or physical
dependence.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite this history of increasing federal action against
marijuana (and other drugs), individual states have been backing
away from marijuana prohibition since the 1970s. Beginning with
Oregon 11 states<sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup> decriminalized
possession or use of limited amounts of marijuana between 1973 and
1978.<sup><a href="#cite-15">15</a></sup> A second wave of
decriminalization began with Nevada in 2001; nine more states and
the District of Columbia have since joined the list.<sup><a href=
"#cite-16">16</a></sup> Fully 25 states and the District of
Columbia have gone further by legalizing marijuana for medical
purposes. In some states, these medical regimes approximate de
facto legalization.</p>
<p>The most dramatic cases of undoing state prohibitions and
departing from federal policy have occurred in the four states
(Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska) that have legalized
marijuana for recreational as well as medical purposes. We next
examine these four states in detail.</p>
<div>
<h3><a name="sec-2.1" id="sec-2.1"></a><strong>Colorado
</strong></h3>
<p>In 1975 Colorado became one of the first states to decriminalize
marijuana after a landmark report by the presidentially appointed
Shafer Commission recommended lower penalties against marijuana use
and suggested alternative methods to discourage heavy drug use.
Decriminalization made possessing less than an ounce of marijuana a
petty offense with a $100 fine.</p>
<p>In November 2000 Colorado legalized medical marijuana through a
statewide ballot initiative. The proposal, known as Amendment 20 or
the Medical Use of Marijuana Act, passed with 54 percent voter
support. It authorized patients and their primary caregivers to
possess up to two ounces of marijuana and up to six marijuana
plants. Patients also needed a state-issued Medical Marijuana
Registry Identification Card with a doctor&rsquo;s recommendation.
State regulations limited caregivers to prescribing medical
marijuana to no more than five patients each.</p>
<p>The number of licensed medical marijuana patients initially grew
at a modest rate. Then, in 2009, after Colorado&rsquo;s Board of
Health abandoned the caregiver-to-patient ratio rule, the medical
marijuana industry took off.<sup><a href="#cite-17">17</a></sup>
That same year, in the so-called &ldquo;Ogden
Memo,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#cite-18">18</a></sup> the U.S.
Department of Justice signaled it would shift resources away from
state medical marijuana issues and refrain from targeting patients
and caregivers.<sup><a href="#cite-19">19</a></sup> Thus, although
medical marijuana remained prohibited under federal law, the
federal government would tend not to intervene in states where it
was legal. Within months, medical marijuana dispensaries
proliferated. Licensed patients rose from 4,800 in 2008 to 41,000
in 2009. More than 900 dispensaries operated by the end of 2009,
according to law enforcement.<sup><a href=
"#cite-20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>In fall 2006 Colorado voters considered Amendment 44, a
statewide ballot initiative to legalize the recreational possession
of up to one ounce of marijuana by individuals aged 21 or older.
Amendment 44 failed, with 58 percent of voters opposed.</p>
<p>In November 2012, however, Colorado voters passed Amendment 64
with 55 percent support, becoming one of the first two states to
relegalize recreational marijuana. The ballot initiative authorized
individuals aged 21 and older with valid government identification
to grow up to six plants and to purchase, possess, and use up to
one ounce of marijuana.<sup><a href="#cite-21">21</a></sup>
Colorado residents could now buy up to one ounce of marijuana in a
single transaction, whereas out-of-state residents could purchase
0.25 ounces.<sup><a href="#cite-22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>In light of Amendment 64, Colorado&rsquo;s government passed new
regulations and taxes to prepare for legalized recreational
marijuana use. A ballot referendum dubbed Proposition AA that was
passed in November 2013 imposed a 15 percent tax on sales of
recreational marijuana from cultivators to retailers and a 10
percent tax on retail sales (in addition to the existing 2.9
percent state sales tax on all goods). Local governments in
Colorado were permitted to impose additional taxes on retail
marijuana.<sup><a href="#cite-23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Following about a year of planning, Colorado&rsquo;s first
retail marijuana businesses opened on January 1, 2014. Each
business was required to pay licensing fees of several hundred
dollars and adhere to other requirements.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><a name="sec-2.2" id="sec-2.2"></a><strong>Washington
</strong></h3>
<p>In 1971 Washington&rsquo;s legislature began loosening its
marijuana laws and decreed that possession of less than 40 grams
would be charged as a misdemeanor. The state legalized medical
marijuana in 1998 after a 1995 court case involving a terminal
cancer patient being treated with marijuana brought extra attention
to the issue and set the stage for a citizen-driven ballot
initiative. In November 1998 state voters approved Initiative 692,
known as the Washington State Medical Use of Marijuana Act, with 59
percent in favor. Use, possession, sale, and cultivation of
marijuana became legal under state law for patients with certain
medical conditions that had been verified by a licensed medical
professional. Initiative 692 also imposed dosage limits on the
drug&rsquo;s use. By 2009 an estimated 35,500 Washingtonians had
prescriptions to buy medical marijuana legally.</p>
<p>In November 2012 Washington joined Colorado in legalizing
recreational marijuana. Voters passed ballot Initiative 502 with 56
percent in support amid an 81 percent voter turnout at the polls.
The proposal removed most state prohibitions on marijuana
manufacture and commerce, permitted limited marijuana use for
adults aged 21 and over, and established the need for a licensing
and regulatory framework to govern the state&rsquo;s marijuana
industry. Initiative 502 further imposed a 25 percent excise tax
levied three times (on marijuana producers, processors, and
retailers) and earmarked the revenue for research, education,
healthcare, and substance-abuse prevention, among other
purposes.<sup><a href="#cite-24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Legal possession of marijuana took effect on December 6, 2012. A
year and a half later, Washington&rsquo;s licensing board began
accepting applications for recreational marijuana shops. After some
backlog, the first four retail stores opened on July 8, 2014. As of
June 2016, several hundred retail stores were open across the
state.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><a name="sec-2.3" id="sec-2.3"></a><strong>Oregon
</strong></h3>
<p>In October 1973 Oregon became the first state to decriminalize
marijuana upon passage of the Oregon Decriminalization Bill. The
bill eliminated criminal penalties for possession of up to an ounce
of marijuana and downgraded the offense from a &ldquo;crime&rdquo;
to a &ldquo;violation&rdquo; with a fine of $500 to
$1,000.<sup><a href="#cite-25">25</a></sup> State law continued to
outlaw using marijuana in public, growing or selling marijuana, and
driving under the influence. In 1997, state lawmakers attempted to
recriminalize marijuana and restore jail sentences as punishment
for possessing less than one ounce, and Oregon&rsquo;s governor
signed the bill. Activists gathered swiftly against the new law,
however, and forced a referendum; the attempt to recriminalize
ended up failing by a margin of 2 to 1.<sup><a href=
"#cite-26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>Oregon medicalized marijuana by ballot initiative in November
1998, with 55 percent support. The Oregon Medical Marijuana Act
legalized cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana by
prescription for patients with specific medical
conditions.<sup><a href="#cite-27">27</a></sup> A new organization
was set up to register patients and caregivers. In 2004 voters
turned down a ballot proposal to increase to 6 pounds the amount of
marijuana a patient could legally possess. Six years later, voters
also rejected an effort to permit medical marijuana dispensaries,
but the state legislature legalized them in 2013.<sup><a href=
"#cite-28">28</a></sup> As of July 2016, Oregon&rsquo;s medical
marijuana program counted nearly 67,000 registered patients, the
vast majority claiming to suffer severe pain, persistent muscle
spasms, and nausea.<sup><a href="#cite-29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>Recreational marijuana suffered several defeats before eventual
approval. In 1986 the Oregon Marijuana Legalization for Personal
Use initiative failed with 74 percent of voters
opposed.<sup><a href="#cite-30">30</a></sup> In November 2012, a
similar measure also failed, even as neighboring Washington passed
its own legalization initiative. Oregon Ballot Measure 80 would
have allowed personal marijuana cultivation and use without a
license, plus unlimited possession for those over age 21. To
oversee the new market, the measure would have established an
industry-dominated board to regulate the sale of commercial
marijuana. This proposal failed with more than 53 percent of the
electorate voting against it.<sup><a href=
"#cite-31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>Full legalization in Oregon finally passed on November 4, 2014,
when voters approved Measure 91, officially known as the Oregon
Legalized Marijuana Initiative. This measure legalized recreational
marijuana for individuals over age 21 and permitted possession of
up to eight ounces of dried marijuana, along with four plants, with
the Oregon Liquor Control Commission regulating sales of the drug.
More than 56 percent of voters cast ballots in favor of the
initiative, making Oregon the third state in the nation (along with
Alaska) to legalize recreational marijuana.<sup><a href=
"#cite-32">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Oregon&rsquo;s legislature then adopted several laws to regulate
the marijuana industry. Legislators passed a 17 percent state sales
tax on marijuana retail sales and empowered local jurisdictions to
charge their own additional 3 percent sales tax.<sup><a href=
"#cite-33">33</a></sup> Later, the state legislature gave
individual counties the option to ban marijuana sales if at least
55 percent of voters in those counties opposed Measure
91.<sup><a href="#cite-34">34</a></sup></p>
<p>Legal sales went into effect on October 1, 2015. As of June
2016, Oregon had 426 locations where consumers could legally
purchase recreational marijuana.<sup><a href=
"#cite-35">35</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><a name="sec-2.4" id="sec-2.4"></a><strong>Alaska
</strong></h3>
<p>Alaska&rsquo;s debate over marijuana policy began with a 1972
court case. Irwin Ravin, an attorney, was pulled over for a broken
taillight and found to be in possession of marijuana. Ravin refused
to sign the traffic ticket while he was in possession of marijuana
so that he could challenge the law. Ultimately, the Alaska Supreme
Court deemed marijuana possession in the privacy of one&rsquo;s
home to be constitutionally protected, and Ravin v. State
established legal precedent in Alaska for years to
come.<sup><a href="#cite-36">36</a></sup></p>
<p>Alaska&rsquo;s legislature decriminalized marijuana in 1975, two
years after Oregon. Persons possessing less than one ounce in
public&mdash;or any amount in one&rsquo;s own home&mdash;could be
fined no more than $100, a fine eliminated in 1982. Marijuana
opponents, however, mobilized later in the decade as law
enforcement busted a number of large, illegal cultivation sites
hidden in residences. A voter initiative in November 1990 proposed
to ban possession and use of marijuana even in one&rsquo;s own
home, punishable by 90 days of jail time and a $1,000 fine. The
initiative passed with 54 percent support.<sup><a href=
"#cite-37">37</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1998 Alaska citizens spearheaded an initiative to legalize
medical marijuana, and 69 percent of voters supported it.
Registered patients consuming marijuana for health conditions
certified by a doctor could possess up to one ounce of marijuana or
up to six plants.<sup><a href="#cite-38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>Advocates then turned to recreational legalization. A ballot
initiative in 2000 proposed legalizing use for anyone 18 years and
older and regulating the drug &ldquo;like an alcoholic
beverage.&rdquo; The initiative failed, with 59 percent of voters
opposed. Voters considered a similar ballot measure in 2004 but
again rejected it.</p>
<p>A third ballot initiative on recreational marijuana legalization
passed in November 2014 with 53 percent of voters in support. It
permitted adults aged 21 and over to possess, use, and grow
marijuana. It also legalized manufacture and sale. The law further
created a Marijuana Control Board to regulate the industry and
establish excise taxes.</p>
<p>State regulators had originally planned to start issuing
applications to growers, processors, and stores in early to
mid-2016. At the time of this writing, retail marijuana shops are
not yet open. This delay, along with data limitations, makes it
difficult to evaluate post-legalization outcomes in Alaska.</p>

<h2><a name="sec-3" id="sec-3"></a><strong>Key Dates</strong></h2>

<p>Our analysis examines whether the trends in marijuana use and
related outcomes changed substantially after these dates. Observed
changes do not necessarily implicate marijuana policy because other
factors might have changed as well. Similarly, the absence of
changes does not prove that policy changes had no effect; the
abundance of potentially confounding variables makes it possible
that, by coincidence, a policy change was approximately offset by
some other factor operating in the opposite direction. Thus, our
analysis focuses on the factual outcomes of marijuana legalization,
rather than on causal inferences.</p>

<div>
<h2><a name="sec-4" id="sec-4"></a><strong>Drug Use</strong></h2>
<p>Arguably the most important potential effect of marijuana
legalization is on marijuana use or other drug or alcohol use.
Opinions differ on whether increased use is problematic or
desirable, but because other outcomes depend on use, a key step is
to determine how much policy affects use. If such effects are
small, then other effects of legalization are also likely to be
small.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows past-year use rates in Colorado for marijuana and
cocaine, along with past-month use rates for alcohol.<sup><a href=
"#cite-40">40</a></sup> The key fact is that marijuana use rates
were increasing modestly for several years before 2009, when
medical marijuana became readily available in dispensaries, and
continued this upward trend through legalization in 2012.
Post-legalization use rates deviate from this overall trend, but
only to a minor degree. The data do not show dramatic changes in
use rates corresponding to either the expansion of medical
marijuana or legalization. Similarly, cocaine exhibits a mild
downward trend over the time period but shows no obvious change
after marijuana policy changes. Alcohol use shows a pattern similar
to marijuana: a gradual upward trend but no obvious evidence of a
response to marijuana policy.</p>

<p>All those observed patterns in marijuana use might provide
evidence for a cultural explanation behind legalization: as
marijuana becomes more commonplace and less stigmatized, residents
and legislators become less opposed to legalization. In essence,
rising marijuana use may not be a consequence of legalization, but
a cause of it.</p>
<p>Consistent with this possibility, Figure 5 plots, for all four
legalizing states, data on perceptions of &ldquo;great risk&rdquo;
from smoking marijuana monthly<sup>.<a href="#cite-42">42</a></sup>
All four states exhibit a steady downward trend, indicating that
fewer people associate monthly marijuana use with high risk. These
downward trends predate legalization, consistent with the view that
changing attitudes toward marijuana fostered both policy changes
and increasing use rates. Interestingly, risk perceptions rose in
Colorado in 2012-2013, immediately following legalization. This
rise may have resulted from public safety and anti-legalization
campaigns that cautioned residents about the dangers of marijuana
use.</p>

<p>Data on marijuana prices may also shed light on marijuana use.
One hypothesis before legalization was that use might soar because
prices would plunge. For example, Dale Gieringer, director of
California&rsquo;s NORML (National Organization for Reform of
Marijuana Laws) branch, testified in 2009 that in a &ldquo;totally
unregulated market, the price of marijuana would presumably drop as
low as that of other legal herbs such as tea or tobacco&mdash;on
the order of a few dollars per ounce&mdash;100 times lower than the
current prevailing price of $300 per ounce.&rdquo;<sup><a href=
"#cite-43">43</a></sup> A separate study by the Rand
Corporation<sup><a href="#cite-44">44</a></sup> estimated that
marijuana prices in California would fall by 80 percent after
legalization.<sup><a href="#cite-45">45</a></sup> Using data from
Price of Weed (priceofweed.com), which crowdsources real-time
information from thousands of marijuana buyers in each state, we
derive monthly average prices of marijuana in Colorado, Washington,
and Oregon.<sup><a href="#cite-46">46</a></sup> See Figures 6, 7,

<p>In Colorado, monthly average prices were declining even before
legalization and have remained fairly steady since. The cost of
high-quality marijuana hovers around $230 per ounce while that of
medium-quality marijuana remains around $200. The opening of shops
in January 2015 seems to have had little effect. In Washington
State, marijuana prices have been similarly steady and have
converged almost exactly to Colorado prices&mdash;roughly $230 for
high-quality marijuana and $190 for medium-quality marijuana.
Oregon prices show a rise after legalization, catching up to
Colorado and Washington levels. Although we cannot draw a
conclusive picture on the basis of consumer-reported data, the
convergence of prices across states makes sense. This convergence
is also consistent with the idea that legalization helped divert
marijuana commerce from the black market to legalized retail
shops.<sup><a href="#cite-47">47</a></sup> Overall, these data
suggest no major drop in marijuana prices after legalization and
consequently less likelihood of soaring use because of cheaper
marijuana.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a name="sec-5" id="sec-5"></a><strong>Health and
Suicides</strong></h2>
<p>Previous studies have suggested a link between medicalization of
marijuana and a lower overall suicide rate, particularly among
demographics most likely to use marijuana in general (males ages 20
to 39).<sup><a href="#cite-48">48</a></sup> In fact, supporters
believe that marijuana can be an effective treatment for bipolar
disorder, depression, and other mood disorders&mdash;not to mention
a safer alternative to alcohol. Moreover, the pain-relieving
element of medical marijuana may help patients avoid more harmful
prescription painkillers and tranquilizers.<sup><a href=
"#cite-49">49</a></sup> Conversely, certain studies suggest
excessive marijuana use may increase the risk of depression,
schizophrenia, unhealthy drug abuse, and anxiety.<sup><a href=
"#cite-50">50</a></sup> Some research also warns about long-lasting
cognitive damage if marijuana is consumed regularly, especially at
a young age<sup>.<a href="#cite-51">51</a></sup></p>
<p>Figure 9 displays the overall yearly suicide rate per 100,000
people in each of the four legalizing states between 1999 and
2014.<sup><a href="#cite-52">52</a></sup> Figure 10 presents the
analogous suicide rate for males aged 20 through 39
years.<sup><a href="#cite-53">53</a></sup> Suicide rates in all
four states trend slightly upward during the 15-year-long period,
but it is difficult to see any association between marijuana
legalization and any changes in these trends. These findings
contrast with many previous studies, so it is possible that any
effects will take longer to appear. In addition, previous research
has suggested a link between medical marijuana and a lower suicide
rate; it is not obvious that recreational marijuana would lead to
the same result, or that legalization of recreational marijuana
after medical marijuana is already legalized would have much of an
extra effect.<sup><a href="#cite-54">54</a>M.</sup></p>

<h2><a name="sec-6" id="sec-6"></a><strong>Crime</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to substance use and health outcomes, legalization
might affect crime. Opponents think these substances cause crime
through psychopharmacological and other mechanisms, and they note
that such substances have long been associated with crime, social
deviancy, and other undesirable aspects of society.<sup><a href=
"#cite-57">57</a></sup> Although those perspectives first emerged
in the 1920s and 1930s, marijuana&rsquo;s perceived associations
with crime and deviancy persist today.<sup><a href=
"#cite-58">58</a></sup></p>
<p>Before referendums in 2012, police chiefs, governors,
policymakers, and concerned citizens spoke up against marijuana and
its purported links to crime.<sup><a href="#cite-59">59</a></sup>
They also argued that expanding drug commerce could increase
marijuana commerce in violent underground markets and that
legalization would make it easy to smuggle the substance across
borders where it remained prohibited, thus causing negative
spillover effects.<sup><a href="#cite-60">60</a></sup></p>
<p>Proponents argue that legalization reduces crime by diverting
marijuana production and sale from the black market to legal
venues. This shift may be incomplete if high tax rates or
significant regulation keeps some marijuana activity in gray or
black markets, but this merely underscores that more legalization
means less crime. At the same time, legalization may reduce the
burden on law enforcement to patrol for drug offenses, thereby
freeing budgets and manpower to address larger crimes. Legalization
supporters also dispute the claim that marijuana increases
neurological tendencies toward violence or aggression.<sup><a href=
"#cite-61">61</a></sup></p>
<p>Figure 13 presents monthly crime rates from Denver, Colorado,
for all reported violent crimes and property crimes.<sup><a href=
"#cite-62">62</a></sup> Both metrics remain essentially constant
after 2012 and 2014; we do not observe substantial deviations from
the illustrated cyclical crime pattern. Other cities in Colorado
mirror those findings. Analogous monthly crime data for Fort
Collins, for example, reveal no increase in violent or property
crime.<sup><a href="#cite-63">63</a></sup></p>

Both categories of crime declined steadily over the past 20 years,
with no major deviations after marijuana liberalization. Property
crime does appear to spike in 2013 and early 2014, and some
commentators have posited that legalization drove this
increase.<sup><a href="#cite-65">65</a></sup> That connection is
not convincing, however, since property crime starts to fall again
after the opening of marijuana shops in mid-2014. All told, crime

<p>Monthly violent and property crime remained steady after
legalization in Portland, Oregon, as seen in Figure
15.<sup><a href="#cite-67">67</a></sup> Portland provides an
interesting case because of its border with Washington. Between
2012 and 2014, Portland (and the rest of Oregon) prohibited the
recreational use of marijuana, while marijuana sales and
consumption were fully legal in neighboring Washingtonian towns
just to the north. This situation creates a natural experiment that
allows us to look for spillover effects in Oregon. Figure 15
suggests that legalization in Washington and the opening of stores
there did not produce rising crime rates across the border.
Elsewhere in Oregon, we see no discernible changes in crime trends
before and after legalization or medical marijuana
liberalization.<sup><a href="#cite-68">68</a></sup></p>

<h2><a name="sec-7" id="sec-7"></a><strong>Road
Safety</strong></h2>
<p>We next evaluate how the incidence of traffic accidents may have
changed in response to marijuana policy changes. Previous
literature and political rhetoric suggest two contrasting
hypotheses. One holds that legalization increases traffic accidents
by spurring drug use and thereby driving under the influence. This
hypothesis presumes that marijuana impairs driving
ability.<sup><a href="#cite-69">69</a></sup> The opposing theory
argues legalization improves traffic safety because marijuana
substitutes for alcohol, which some studies say impairs driving
ability even more.<sup><a href="#cite-70">70</a></sup> Moreover,
some consumers may be able to drive better if marijuana serves to
relieve their pain.</p>
<p>Rhetoric from experts and government officials has been equally
divided. Kevin Sabet, a former senior White House drug policy
adviser, warned that potential consequences of Colorado&rsquo;s
legalization could include large increases in traffic
accidents.<sup><a href="#cite-71">71</a></sup> A recent Associated
Press article noted that &ldquo;fatal crashes involving marijuana
doubled in Washington after legalization.&rdquo;<sup><a href=
"#cite-72">72</a></sup> Yet Coloradan law enforcement agents are
themselves unsure whether legal marijuana has led to an increase in
accidents.<sup><a href="#cite-73">73</a></sup> Research by Radley
Balko, an opinion blogger for the Washington Post and an author on
drug policy, claims that, overall, &ldquo;highway fatalities in
Colorado are at near-historic lows&rdquo; in the wake of
legalization<sup>.<a href="#cite-74">74</a></sup></p>
<p>Figure 16 presents the monthly rate of fatal accidents and
fatalities per 100,000 residents in Colorado.<sup><a href=
"#cite-75">75</a></sup> No spike in fatal traffic accidents or
fatalities followed the liberalization of medical marijuana in
2009.<sup><a href="#cite-76">76</a></sup> Although fatality rates
have reached slightly higher peaks in recent summers, no obvious
jump occurs after either legalization in 2012 or the opening of
stores in 2014.<sup><a href="#cite-77">77</a></sup> Likewise,
neither marijuana milestone in Washington State appears to have
substantially affected the fatal crash or fatality rate, as
illustrated in figure 17.<sup><a href="#cite-78">78</a></sup> In
fact, more granular statistics reveal that the fatality rate for
drug-related crashes was virtually unchanged after
legalization.<sup><a href="#cite-79">79</a></sup></p>
<p>Figure 18 depicts the crash fatality rate in
Oregon.<sup><a href="#cite-80">80</a></sup> Although few post-
legalization data were available at the time of publication, we
observe no signs of deviations in trend after the opening of
medical marijuana dispensaries in 2013. We can also test for
possible spillover effects from neighboring Washington.
Legalization there in 2012 and the opening of marijuana shops in
2014 do not seem to materially affect road fatalities in Oregon in
either direction.</p>
<p>Finally, Figure 19 presents annual data on crash fatality rates
in Alaska; these show no discernible increase after legalization
and may even decline slightly.</p>

<h2><a name="sec-8" id="sec-8"></a><strong>Youth
Outcomes</strong></h2>
<p>Much of the concern surrounding marijuana legalization relates
to its possible effect on youths. Many observers, for example, fear
that expanded legal access&mdash;even if officially limited to
adults age 21 and over&mdash;might increase use by teenagers, with
negative effects on intelligence, educational outcomes, or other
youth behaviors.<sup><a href="#cite-81">81</a></sup>, <sup><a href=
"#cite-82">82</a></sup></p>
<p>Figure 20 displays the total number of school suspensions and
drug-related suspensions in Colorado public high schools during
each academic year.<sup><a href="#cite-83">83</a></sup> Total
suspensions trend downward over time, with a slight bump after
2014, but that bump was not one driven by drug-related causes.
Drug-related suspensions appear to rise after medical marijuana
commercialization in 2009 but stay level after full legalization
and the opening of retail shops. Figure 21 shows public high school
expulsions, both overall and drug-related. It reveals a parallel
bump in drug-related expulsions right after marijuana
liberalization in 2009, but expulsions drop steeply thereafter. In
fact, by 2014, expulsions drop back to their previous levels.</p>

<p>We also consider potential effects on academic performance.
Standardized test scores measuring the reading proficiency of 8th
and 10th graders in Washington State show no indication of
significant positive or negative changes caused by legalization, as
illustrated in Figure 22.<sup><a href="#cite-84">84</a></sup>
Although some studies have found that frequent marijuana use
impedes teen cognitive development, our results do not suggest a
major change in use, thereby implying no major changes in testing
performance.</p>

<h2><a name="sec-9" id="sec-9"></a><strong>Economic
Outcomes</strong></h2>
<p>Changing economic and demographic outcomes are unlikely to be
significant effects of marijuana legalization, simply because
marijuana is a small part of the overall economy. Nevertheless, we
consider this outcome for completeness. Before legalization, many
advocates thought that legalization could drive a robust influx of
residents, particularly young individuals enticed to move across
state lines to take advantage of loose marijuana laws. More
recently, various news articles say housing prices in Colorado
(particularly around Denver) are soaring at growth rates far above
the national average, perhaps as a consequence of marijuana
legalization. One analyst went so far as to say that marijuana has
essentially &ldquo;kick-started the recovery of the industrial
market in Denver&rdquo; and led to record-high rent
levels.<sup><a href="#cite-85">85</a></sup></p>
<p>Figure 23 sheds doubt on these extreme claims by presenting the
Case-Shiller Home Price Index for Denver, Seattle, and Portland,
along with the national average.<sup><a href=
"#cite-86">86</a></sup> Data show that home prices in all three
cities have been rising steadily since mid-2011, with no apparent
booms after marijuana policy changes. Housing prices in Denver did
rise at a robust rate after January 2014, when marijuana shops
opened, but this increase was in step with the national
average.</p>

<br>
<p>Furthermore, marijuana legalization in all four legalizing
states had, at most, a trivial effect on population
growth.<sup><a href="#cite-87">87</a></sup> Whereas some people may
have moved across states for marijuana purposes, any resulting
growth in population has been small and unlikely to cause
noticeable increases in housing prices or total economic
output.</p>
<p>Advocates also argue that legalization boosts economic activity
by creating jobs in the marijuana sector, including
&ldquo;marijuana tourism&rdquo; and other support industries,
thereby boosting economic output.<sup><a href=
"#cite-88">88</a></sup> Marijuana production and commerce do employ
many thousands of people, and Colorado data provide some hint of a
measurable effect on employment. As Figure 24 indicates, the
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate began to fall more
dramatically after the start of 2014, which coincides with the
opening of marijuana stores.<sup><a href="#cite-89">89</a></sup>
These gains, however, have yet to be seen in Washington, Oregon,
and Alaska. One hypothesis may be that Colorado, as the first state
to open retail shops, benefitted from a &ldquo;first mover
advantage.&rdquo; If more states legalize, any employment gains
will become spread out more broadly, and marijuana tourism may
diminish.</p>

<p>Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis show little evidence
of significant gross domestic product (GDP) increases after
legalization in any state.<sup><a href="#cite-90">90</a></sup>
Although it is hard to disentangle marijuana-related economic
activity from broader economic trends, the surges in economic
output predicted by some proponents have not yet materialized.
Similarly, no clear changes have occurred in GDP per capita.</p>
<p>One area where legal marijuana has reaped unexpectedly large
benefits is state tax revenue. Colorado, Washington, and Oregon all
impose significant excise taxes on recreational marijuana, along
with standard state sales taxes, other local taxes, and licensing
fees. As seen in Figure 25, Colorado collects well over $10 million
per month from recreational marijuana alone.<sup><a href=
"#cite-91">91</a></sup> In 2015 the state generated a total of $135
million in recreational marijuana revenue, $35 million of which was
earmarked for school construction projects. These figures are above
some pre-legalization forecasts, although revenue growth was
disappointingly sluggish during the first few months of
sales.<sup><a href="#cite-92">92</a></sup> A similar story has
unfolded in Washington, as illustrated in Figure 26, where
recreational marijuana generated approximately $70 million in tax
revenue in the first year of sales<sup><a href=
"#cite-93">93</a></sup>&mdash;double the original revenue
forecast.<sup><a href="#cite-94">94</a></sup> Oregon only began
taxing recreational marijuana in January 2016, so data are still
preliminary; however, state officials report revenues of $14.9
million so far, well above the initial estimate of $2.0 million to
$3.0 million for the entire calendar year<sup><a href=
"#cite-95">95</a></sup> The tax revenues in these states may
decline.</p>
<p>Limited post-legalization data prevent us from ruling out small
changes in marijuana use or other outcomes. As additional
post-legalization data become available, expanding this analysis
will continue to inform the debate. The data so far provide little
support for the strong claims about legalization made by either
opponents or supporters.</p>
</div>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p id="cite-1">1. In November 2014, the District of Columbia voted
overwhelmingly in favor of Initiative 71, which legalized the use,
possession, and cultivation of limited amounts of marijuana in the
privacy of one&rsquo;s home. It also permitted adults age 21 and
over to &ldquo;gift&rdquo;&mdash;or transfer&mdash;up to two ounces
of marijuana provided no payment or other exchange of goods or
services occurred. Selling marijuana or consuming it in public,
however, remain criminal violations. In addition, because of
ongoing federal prohibition, marijuana remains illegal on federal
land, which makes up 30 percent of the District. Therefore, we do
not examine data for D.C. For more, see <code class="uri"><a href=

<p id="cite-2">2. In June 2016, the California secretary of state
announced that a ballot referendum on marijuana legalization would
occur in November, after a state campaign amassed enough signatures
to put the question to a vote. Other likely candidates include
Arizona, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada,
New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Organizations and private
citizens in additional states have raised the idea of ballot
initiatives but have not yet garnered the requisite signatures to
hold a vote. See Jackie Salo, &ldquo;Marijuana Legalization 2016:

resolve confusion about the role of federal law in state marijuana
policy. In 2011, the Department of Justice issued another memo
entitled the &ldquo;Cole Memo&rdquo; which somewhat backpedaled on
the Ogden Memo&rsquo;s position; it cautioned that &ldquo;the Ogden
Memorandum was never intended to shield such activities from
federal enforcement action and prosecution, even where those
activities purport to comply with state law.&rdquo; It was not
until 2013 when those in the marijuana industry received a clear
answer. A third memo unambiguously outlined the eight scenarios in
which federal authorities would enforce marijuana laws in states
where the substance was legal. Beyond those eight priorities, the
federal government would leave marijuana law enforcement to local
authorities. For more, see &ldquo;Guidance Regarding the Ogden Memo

<p id="cite-45">45. These analyses consider legalization at both
the federal and state levels which would allow additional avenues
for lower prices such as economies of scale, although also
additional avenues for higher prices because of federal taxation
and advertising.</p>
<p id="cite-46">46. The website Price of Weed allows anyone to
submit anonymous data about the price, quantity, and quality of
marijuana he or she purchases, as well as where the marijuana was
purchased. Founded in 2010, the website has logged hundreds of
thousands of entries across the country, and many analysts and
journalists look to it as a source of marijuana price data. It has
obvious limitations: the data are not a random sample; the consumer
reports do not distinguish between marijuana bought through legal
means and through the black market; self-reported data may not be
accurate; and the data are probably from a self-selecting crowd of
marijuana enthusiasts. Nevertheless, Price of Weed provides large
samples of real-time data. To reduce the impact of inaccurate
submissions, the website automatically removes the bottom and top 5
percent of outliers when calculating its average prices. We were
not able to calculate meaningful marijuana price averages from
Alaska because of a relatively low number of entries from that
state.</p>
<p id="cite-47">47. One further trend we observe in all three
states is a widening price gap between high-quality and
medium-quality marijuana. Among other things, this gap may be the
result of fewer information asymmetries in the marijuana market. On
the black market, it can be hard to know the true quality of a
product. Marijuana trade is complex, with hundreds of different
strains and varieties. Yet in the black market, consumers often
have a difficult time differentiating between them and may end up
paying similarly high prices for medium- and high-quality
marijuana. In all three states, the gap between the prices rose
after legalization, suggesting that consumers have had an easier
time distinguishing between different qualities and strains of
marijuana.</p>

<p id="cite-54">54. The link between medical marijuana and lower
suicide rates may stem partly from the fact that medical marijuana
can substitute for other, more dangerous painkillers and opiates.
Research by Anne Case and Angus Deaton found suicides and drug
poisonings led to a marked increase in mortality rates of
middle-aged white non-Hispanic men and women in the United States
between 1999 and 2013. Other studies have linked opioid and
painkiller overdoses to a recent surge in self-inflicted
drug-related deaths and suicides. Medical marijuana, as a less
risky pain reliever, may thus help lessen the rate of drug deaths
and suicides. For more, see Case and Deaton, &ldquo;Rising

seems equally robust. Tacoma, a large city in northeastern

crime trends before and after legalization. Total monthly offenses,
violent crime, and property crime have shown no significant

suggested a possible substitution effect. A 2015 report by the

that marijuana-positive fatalities rose by 4 percent after

report discovered no change in total traffic fatalities in
California after its decriminalization of the drug in 2011. See

types of roads, as recorded by each state&rsquo;s department of
transportation. See Colorado Department of Transportation&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Fatal Accident Statistics by City and County,&rdquo;

<p id="cite-76">76. Annual crash data from the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) confirm these findings. Our
analysis uses state-level traffic accident data from individual
state transportation departments because their data are mostly
reported monthly and have a shorter reporting time lag than NHTSA
data. For NHTSA data, see &ldquo;State Traffic Safety
Information,&rdquo; NHTSA, <code class="uri"><a href=

<p id="cite-77">77. We additionally analyzed fatality rates for
accidents involving alcohol impairment. Similarly, this time series
shows no clear signs of significant swings after marijuana policy
changes, suggesting that any substitution effect associated with
marijuana has been small compared to overall drunk driving.</p>

<code class="uri"><a href=
"http://wtsc.wa.gov/research-data/crash-data/" target=

<p id="cite-79">79. Washington State police routinely test drivers
involved in car crashes for traces of various substances. The
official legalization of marijuana use at the end of 2012 appears
to have had at most a negligible effect on crash fatalities. The
Washington Traffic Safety Commission recorded a total of 62
marijuana-related crash fatalities in 2013, compared to 61 in 2012.
There does seem to be a temporary increase in fatalities caused by
marijuana-related crashes around the same time as the establishment
of Washington&rsquo;s first marijuana shops. Nevertheless, any sort
of spike seems to have been temporary. In the first six months
following the opening of stores, 46 crash fatalities were tied to
using marijuana while driving; over the following six months, that
number dropped to 32.</p>
<p id="cite-80">80. Monthly data on fatal crashes themselves were
not available. Monthly 2015 data were also not available at the
time of writing.</p>
<p id="cite-81">81. For instance, Meier et al. analyze a large
sample of individuals tracked from birth to age 38 and find that
those who smoked marijuana most heavily prior to age 18 lost an
average of eight IQ points, a highly significant drop. See Madeline
Meier et al., &ldquo;Persistent Cannabis Users Show
Neuropsychological Decline from Childhood to Midlife,&rdquo;
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 109, no. 40 (2012):
E2657-E2664, <code class="uri"><a href=
"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22927402" target=
"_top">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22927402</a></code>.
However, other studies have found results that rebut Meier et al.
Mokrysz et al. examine an even larger sample of adolescents and,
after controlling for many potentially confounding variables,
discover no significant correlation between teen marijuana use and
IQ change. See Claire Mokrysz et al., &ldquo;Are IQ and Educational
Outcomes in Teenagers Related to Their Cannabis Use? A Prospective
Cohort Study,&rdquo; Journal of Psychopharmacology 30, no. 2
(2016): 159-68,<code class="uri"> <a href=

<p id="cite-82">82. Cobb-Clark et al. show that much of
relationship between marijuana use and educational outcomes is
likely due to selection, although there is possibly some causal
effect in reducing university entrance scores. See Deborah A.
Cobb-Clark et al., &ldquo;&lsquo;High&rsquo;-School: The
Relationship between Early Marijuana Use and Educational
Outcomes,&rdquo; Economic Record 91, no. 293 (June 2015): 247-66.
Evidence in McCaffrey et al. supports this selection explanation of
the association between marijuana use and educational outcomes. See
Daniel F. McCaffrey et al., &ldquo;Marijuana Use and High School
Dropout: The Influence of Unobservables,&rdquo; Health Economics
19, no. 11 (November 2010): 1281-99.Roebuck et al. suggest that
chronic marijuana use, not more casual use, likely drives any
relationship between marijuana use and school attendance. See M.
Christopher Roebuck et al., &ldquo;Adolescent Marijuana Use and
School Attendance,&rdquo; Economics of Education Review 23, no. 2
(2004), 133-41.Marie and Zölitz estimate grade improvements are
likely due to improved cognitive functioning among students whose
nationalities prohibited them from consuming marijuana. See Olivier
Marie and Ulf Zölitz, &ldquo;&lsquo;High&rsquo; Achievers? Cannabis
Access and Academic Performance,&rdquo; CESifo Working Paper Series
no. 5304, Center for Economic Studies and Ifo Institute, Munich,
2015.Van Ours and Williams review the literature concluding that
cannabis may reduce educational outcomes, particularly with early
onset of use. See Jan van Ours and Jenny Williams, &ldquo;Cannabis
Use and Its Effects on Health, Education and Labor Market
Success,&rdquo; Journal of Economic Surveys, 29, no. 5 (December
