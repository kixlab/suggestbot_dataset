<h3>Brain Development<br /></h3>

<p><img src="gif/deve1.gif" class="fl" alt="" />The brain grows at an 
amazing rate during development. At times during brain development, 
<strong>250,000 neurons</strong> are added every minute! At birth, a 
person's brain will have <a href="neurogen.html">almost all the 
neurons</a> that it will ever have. The brain continues to grow for a few 
years after a person is born and by the age of 2 years old, the brain is 
about 80% of the adult size.</p>

<p>You may wonder, "How does the brain continue to grow, if the brain has
most of the neurons it will get when you are born?".  The answer is in <a
href="glia.html">glial cells</a>.  Glia continues to divide and
multiply.  Glia carries out many important functions for normal brain
function including insulating nerve cells with myelin. The neurons in the
brain also make many new connections after birth.</p>

<h3>The Brain During Development</h3>

<p>The nervous system develops from embryonic tissue called the
<strong>ectoderm</strong>.  The first sign of the developing nervous
system is the <strong>neural plate</strong> that can be seen at about the
16th day of development.  Over the next few days, a "trench" is formed in
the neural plate - this creates a <strong>neural groove</strong>.  By the
21st day of development, a <strong>neural tube</strong>
is formed when the edges of the neural groove meet.  The rostral (front)
part of the neural tubes goes on to develop into the brain and the rest of
the neural tube develops into the spinal cord.  Neural crest cells become
the peripheral nervous system.</p>

<p class="don"><img src="gif/tube1.gif" width="358" height="140" alt="" /></p>

<p>At the front end of the neural tube, three major brain areas are
formed:  the prosencephalon (forebrain), mesencepalon (midbrain) and
rhombencephalon (hindbrain).  By the 7th week of development, these <a
href="phylo.html">three areas divide again</a>.  This process is called
<strong>encephalization</strong>.</p>

<h3>Brain Weight</h3>
<p><img src="gif/brweight.gif" width="360" height="405" class="fl"
alt="" /> The top graph on the left shows the brain weights of
males and females at different ages.  The bottom graph shows the brain
weight to total body weight ratio (expressed as a percentage).   The adult
brain makes up about 2% of the total body weight.<br />

<p>DID YOU KNOW?  Touch is the first sense to develop.  The developing 
fetus responds to touch of the lips and cheeks by 8 weeks and to other 
parts of its body at 14 week.  The sense of taste may develop by 12 weeks 
and that of sound at 22-24 weeks. (Reference:  Hepper, P., "Unraveling our 
beginnings", <i>The Psychologist,</i> 18:474-477, 2005.) </p>
