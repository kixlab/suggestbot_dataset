<p><strong>What were the arguments of the pro-slavery lobby?</strong></p><p>The pro-slavery lobby put forward a number of arguments to defend the trade and show how important it was to Britain:</p><ul><li><strong>The trade was necessary to the success and wealth of Britain.</strong> The merchants and planters warned that abolition would mean ruin for Britain, as the whole economy would collapse. This argument was put forward many times,&nbsp;for example,&nbsp;in 1749, when a <a href="http://gallery.nen.gov.uk/audio78797-abolition.html" title="Speech">pamphlet</a> was written outlining these agruments.</li><li><strong>If Britain did not engage in the trade then others would.</strong>&nbsp;If&nbsp;Britain ceased to trade&nbsp;in slaves with Africa, our commercial rivals, the French and the Dutch, would soon fill the gap&nbsp;and the Africans would be in a much worse situation. This was&nbsp;an argument used in a <a href="http://gallery.nen.gov.uk/audio78790-abolition.html" title="Temple Luttrell speech">speech to parliament in 1777</a>.</li><li><strong>Africa was already involved in slavery.</strong> They stated that Africans enslaved each other. Indeed, Britain was&nbsp;engaged in a moral trade because they were helping people, captured in African wars, who&nbsp;may otherwise be executed.&nbsp; </li><li><strong>Taking Africans from their homeland actually benefited them.</strong>&nbsp; They argued that African societies and cultures were&nbsp;unskilled, uneducated and&nbsp;savage. For example, Michael Renwick Sergant, a merchant from Liverpool claimed:<em>&nbsp;&lsquo;We ought to consider whether the negroes in a well regulated plantation, under the protection of a kind master, do not enjoy as great, nay, even greater advantages than when under their own despotic governments'.</em> In his publication <em>'The history of the British West Indies'</em> (published 1819), Mr Edwards also uses this argument when he describes a woman who said she prefered Jamaica to Guninea as people were not killed there. <a href="http://gallery.nen.gov.uk/audio79025-abolition.html" title="Extact">Here the extract</a>.</li><li><strong>The enslaved people were unfit for other work.</strong>&nbsp;Many people were very prejudiced in their beliefs.&nbsp;Many ordinary people in Britain were uneducated and travelled little further than their own village, making it easier for those involved in the trade to influence public opinion.</li><li><strong>The enslaved people&nbsp;were not ill-treated unless rebellious. Conditions on the slave ships were acceptable.</strong>&nbsp; Several of those involved in the trade, merchants, ships' captains and plantation owners, provided evidence to parliament regarding this. One example is the report of <a href="http://gallery.nen.gov.uk/audio75763-abolition.html" title="Mr Norris">Mr. Norris</a> to the privy council in 1789.</li><li><p><strong>Slavery was accepted in the bible.</strong> The pro-slavery supporters used the bible to suggest that the Slave Trade was tolerated and approved of by God in the days of Abraham.&nbsp;In a book by an unknown author - The Negro and the Free Born Briton compared; or a vindication of the African slave trade 1790 - the author argued that slavery was lawful&nbsp;from a religious, political and commercial view.</p></li></ul><p><strong>What were Arguments of the anti-slavery lobby?</strong></p><p>The anti-slavery society countered the claims of the pro-slavery lobby&nbsp;by providing evidence to disprove the arguments:&nbsp; </p><ul><li><strong>There were alternatives to the trade.</strong> Much of the evidence that Thomas Clarkson collected during his travels illustrated&nbsp; the potential for&nbsp;practical alternatives. The seeds, minerals and crafts that he carried in <a href="../../box_58.html" title="Abolition">'the Clarkson box'</a> were used to demonstrate this.</li><li><strong>If something is wrong, it is wrong whether others do it or not.</strong> The anti-slavery supporters argued that just because other countries engaged in the trade this did not provide a valid reason&nbsp;for Britain to also participate, even if it was profitable. This argument was used by <a href="../../people_65.html" title="Abolition">Baron Grenville</a> in his speech to the House of Lords when he said, &quot;<em>...Can there be a question that the character of the country ought to be cleared from the stain impressed by the guilt of such traffic,...&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em> The argument&nbsp;was also cleverly countered in William Cowper's <a href="http://gallery.nen.gov.uk/audio78530-abolition.html" title="audio">Poem</a> 'A Pity for Poor Africans'.</li><li><strong>The slavery that existed in Africa was very different&nbsp;from the Transatlantic Slave Trade.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Those enslaved in Africa were usually prisoners of war or victims of political or judicial punishment. The&nbsp;enslaved people&nbsp;could keep their&nbsp;name and identity and&nbsp;slavery did not extend to future generations.&nbsp; </li><li><strong>The African people were in no way inferior and should be treated as equals.</strong> The Quaker teacher, <a href="../../people_27.html" title="Abolition">Anthony Benezet</a>, was always horrified at the suggestion that the Africans were in anyway inferior. His claimed his experiences,&nbsp;gained during&nbsp;20 years teaching black pupils, proved this was not the case.&nbsp;However, it was the&nbsp;books and speeches of&nbsp;African writers of the time, such as&nbsp;<a href="../../people_25.html" title="Abolition">Olaudah Equiano</a>,&nbsp;that had the greatest impact in&nbsp;dispelling such misconceptions. Even some of those involved in the slave trade were willing to admit that raciest views were wrong, as illustrated by the <a href="http://gallery.nen.gov.uk/audio79029-abolition.html" title="Speech">writings of Captain Thomas Philips</a></li><li><strong>The trade was damaging to Africa.</strong> William Wilberforce summed this up in his speech of 1789: &quot;<em>...</em><em>Does anyone suppose a slave trade would help their civilization? Is it not plain, that she must suffer from it? </em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>....</em><em>Does not everyone see that a slave trade, carried on around her coasts, must carry violence and desolation to her very centre</em><em>?... Does the king of Barbess </em><em>want brandy? He has only to send his troops in the night time, to burn and desolate a village; the captives will serve as commodities that may be bartered with the British trader.</em><em>&quot;</em></li><li><strong>The Africans suffered greatly from being removed from their homeland.</strong>&nbsp; They collected evidence to show that many resisted or preferred death to transportation. Many more died on the voyage to the Caribbean. Conditions on the ships were terrible, as&nbsp;illustrated and the <a href="http://gallery.nen.gov.uk/audio80463-abolition.html" title="Wilberforce speech">speech made by William Wilberforce</a> to parliament in 1789 and by testimony from people like ship's doctor <a href="../../people_28.html" title="Abolition">James Ramsay</a> . The replacement rate statistics also showed the appallingly low life expectancy of slaves on the plantations (7-9 years on some large plantations).</li><li><strong>It was morally wrong and, as a Christian country, Britain should not be involved.</strong> The anti-slavery society also used the bible to back up their arguments. They pointed to biblical text like&nbsp;Luke 16:13: <em>&quot;No man can serve two masters&quot;&nbsp;.</em>&nbsp;In answer to the claims of the pro-slavery lobby, Granville Sharp, for example,&nbsp;wrote in his pamphlet 'The just limitation of slavery in the Laws of God': <em>&quot;...If we carefully examine the scriptures we shall find that slavery and oppression were ever abominable in the sight of God...&quot;</em></li></ul><p><a href="http://gallery.nen.gov.uk/gallery1375-abolition.html" title="Audio Album">Audio Library - Proslavery Arguments</a><br /><a href="http://gallery.nen.gov.uk/gallery1573-abolition.html" title="Audio Album">Audio Library - Anit-Slavery Arguments</a></p><p><a href="javascript:history.go(-1);">Back</a></p></table>
