But now that the Vatican&#8217;s highest court is led by an American, the former St. Louis <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Leo_Burke">Archbishop Raymond Burke</a>, we can expect things to get more explicit in Vatican City &#8212; at least when when it comes to U.S. politics.</p>
<p>Burke, who was named prefect of the Vatican&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/tribunals/apost_signat/documents/rc_trib_apsig_doc_20000526_profilo_it.html">Supreme Court of the Apostolic Signature</a> in June, told the Italian Catholic newspaper <em>Avvenire</em><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/wp-admin/www.avvenire.it/"> </a>that <a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=13936">the U.S. Democratic Party risked</a>  <em>&#8220;transforming itself definitively into a party of death for its decisions on bioethical issues.&#8221;</em> He then attacked two of the party&#8217;s most high profile Catholics &#8212; vice presidential candidate <a href="http://biden.senate.gov/issues/issue/?id=12edb4e5-0755-43f4-8ce5-da0beb58e510">Joe Biden </a>and House Speaker <a href="http://speaker.house.gov/newsroom/pressreleases?id=0753">Nancy Pelosi</a> &#8212; for misrepresenting Church teaching on abortion.</p>
<p>He said Biden and Pelosi, <em>&#8220;while presenting themselves as good Catholics, have presented Church doctrine on abortion in a false and tendentious way.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/files/2008/09/pelosi.jpg" title="Nancy Pelosi kisses Pope Benedict’s ring during his U.S. visit, 16 April 2008/Larry Downing"><img src="http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/files/2008/09/pelosi.jpg" alt="Nancy Pelosi kisses Pope Benedict’s ring during his U.S. visit, 16 April 2008/Larry Downing" class="imageframe" align="right" height="228" width="300" /></a>Pelosi drew U.S. bishops&#8217; scorn for saying in a <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26377338/page/3/">television interview</a> last month that the Church itself had long debated when human life begins. Biden is a practicing Catholic who also supports abortion rights and analysts have said he could help woo wavering Catholics into Obama&#8217;s fold. Both argue that they cannot impose their religious views on others.</p>
<p>Burke said pro-life Democrats were <em>&#8220;rare&#8221;</em> and that it saddened him that the party that helped<em> &#8220;our immigrant parents and grandparents&#8221;</em> prosper in America had changed so much over the years.</p>
<p>Burke made headlines as archbishop of St. Louis for his public attacks on public figures who strayed from Catholic teaching. He suggested during the 2004 presidential campaign that Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, a Catholic, should be denied communion because of his views on abortion. Several bishops said at the time they would not give him communion and the media staked out churches where he attended Mass to see if he received it.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Lately, I&#8217;ve noticed that other bishops are coming to this position,&#8221;</em> Burke told <em>Avvenire</em>, which is owned by the Italian bishops&#8217; conference.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/files/2008/10/burke.jpg" title="Archbishop Raymond Burke/Archdiocese of St. Louis"><img src="http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/files/2008/10/burke.jpg" alt="Archbishop Raymond Burke/Archdiocese of St. Louis" class="imageframe" align="left" height="203" width="144" /></a>Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI,  <a href="http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/7056?eng=y">wrote a letter in 2004</a>  to American bishops restating the Church position that a priest must refuse to distribute communion to a Catholic politician who supported abortion rights. But Burke lamented that the letter was never distributed.</p>
<p>Burke&#8217;s criticism isn&#8217;t limited to Democrats. Last year, he accused singer Sheryl Crow of being <em>&#8220;a high profile proponent of the destruction of innocent lives&#8221;</em> for defending a woman&#8217;s right to have an abortion and for being a proponent of stem cell research. He resigned as head of a children&#8217;s medical charity that featured the singer for a benefit concert.</p>
<p>Pope Benedict has been encouraging Catholic bishops to speak out more openly on public policy issues to make the Church&#8217;s voice heard. Any bets on when we&#8217;ll hear from Burke next?</p>

<p>The article is about the &#8220;Democrats as the &#8216;party of death\'&#8221; (read the title), AS IF the Republicans are the &#8220;party of life&#8221;.</p>
<p>With regards to abortion:</p>
<p>A nuclear war with Iran (apparently, to the &#8220;Vatican official&#8221;, the nuclear incineration and/or slow agonizing death from radiation poisoning, starvation and disease of millions of Muslim men, women, children, infants and fetuses is not as bad as the abortion of hundreds of thousands of Christian fetuses in the United States) will be the precursor to what may very well amount to the abortion of the human *race*, if things turn out as have been widely predicted.</p>
<p>Said &#8220;Vatican official&#8221; appears to value the life of fetuses *more* than the lives of those who are slaughtered, tortured, and maimed by warfare (who often suffer decades before dying&#8211;for example, those Muslims who were victims of chemical warfare during the war between Iraq and Iran).</p>
<p>There does not appear to be any consistent &#8220;pro-life&#8221; ethic involved here, suggesting a fundamental agreement with the Christo-fascist Crusade which the United States is currently waging against the Muslims.</p>

                        <p>Michael: Even if you were correct about Iran &#8211; &#8211; which you are not (and reliable world news sources, not just U.S. sources, differ completely with your conclusions) &#8211; &#8211; you would still be wrong because the article is about high-profile politicians who happen to be &#8220;Catholic&#8221; democrats who publicly on TV  and in other public venues misrepresented Catholic teaching on abortion for the purpose of attempting to justify their positions on the topic, which Archbishop Burke has every right, and in fact a duty, to correct. And by the way, the Democratic Party in general is a pro-choice party &#8211; &#8211; i.e., ok to abort a baby in the womb.  Imagine if your mother had thought that way, Michael?  And, Pat, I agree with you that neither party is in a position to throw the first stone but Archbishop Burke is by no means casting the first stone because so- called &#8220;Catholic&#8221; politicians like Pelosi and Biden (and there are a number of others) have for years been voting  on the side of abortion without a single word from the bishops.  So the time has finally come (better late than never) for some of the bishops to speak out.  It&#8217;s just unfortunate that it took a public misrepresentation by these politicians of the Church&#8217;s position on abortion, rather than the terrible act itself, to elicit a correction by the bishops &#8211; &#8211; but I say again better late than never!</p>

                        <p>Aborted fetuses, those poor days old souls, are actually lucky. They never will sin, therefore, God in his mercy brings them back into his heavenly fold. God gave us free will with the knowledge that &#8220;HE&#8221; will judge us for our sins. HE will judge, because he said not to judge unless we want to be judged by him as harshly as we judge others. Murder is murder, whether a 3 day old soul or a 20 year old soul killed in war. If your against abortion, you better be doubly against war. Warriors break the commandment &#8220;Thou shalt not kill&#8221; and they do it, they hold the gun with intent to kill their misunderstood brother of their own free will. How do you think they will be judged? We need to end all wars and jihads before we think about abortion. our priorities are messed up and backwards. When the world is no longer at war with itself, abortion will truly no longer be needed because by then we will realize the true preciousness of life.</p>

                        <p>Regardless of one&#8217;s religious views on abortion, it is unethical to legislate your religion on others.</p>
<p>What Biden said once was &#8220;I believe life begins at conception, however I don&#8217;t feel it is my duty to legislate my faith on others.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it isn&#8217;t. The religious zealots in this country and others are constantly trying to shove their views and morals down everyone else&#8217;s throat.<br />
We created a seperation of church and state for this very reason. People have different beliefs and views and no one is &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;wrong&#8221;. It&#8217;s simply a religious choice.<br />
One that should NEVER EVER be forced on anyone.</p>
<p>Another issue I have with these pro-life folks, is that they are often the same folks who are strongly against socialized or governmental health care. Which is a double standard.</p>
<p>These people seek to force unwanted births on folks, and then refuse to ensure the newborns health with proper healthcare. It becomes the mother and fathers responsibilty to provide proper health coverage.</p>
<p>But what happens when you&#8217;re forcing those same mothers and fathers to have children they can not afford? You&#8217;re essentially forcing a life to be born into poverty and hardship. </p>
<p>What&#8217;s funny is I am an atheist. I have no religious affiliation at all. Period. Yet I still abhor the idea of abortion. However even when my view is not a religious formed view, it still does not give me the right to legislate my beliefs on another individual. </p>
<p>Each person has a freedom of choice, and the decision a pregnant woman has to struggle with about either having the baby or having an abortion, or giving it up to adoption, or etc. that choice is hers and hers alone.</p>

                        <p>The Holy See never gave a damn what the laity thought, that much was evident with the way it handled the whole sex and abuse scandal, except when it was convenient for them to issue more dogma and rhetorical mind control to the faithful. They considered the abuse scandal  &#8220;America&#8217;s problem&#8221;, including all the lives they help shatter. The American Dioceses did no better by protecting the violators in their ranks. Benevolence and tolerance, right? Crap. And to have the unmitigated arrogance to announce their primacy over other religions. They really need to practice what they preach and eliminate the patriarchy and Byzantine trappings but most of all shut their self-righteous mouths and stay out of politics, period.<br />

                        <p>I think that it is safe to say that both main parties need to rise above the dogma and doctrine &#8212; from all sources &#8212; that prevents the world from developing into a more convivial place.  We have vested a tremendous amount of power in institutions and individuals that are doing nothing but trotting out the same old ideologies.  As a society, we have been on a downward slide for too long.  Let&#8217;s expand our minds and contract the rhetoric.</p>

                        <p>Michael, in order to make your point, you need not misrepresent either the Archbishop or the Church &#8211; &#8211; and you are doing both.  There is nothing &#8220;apparent&#8221; in what the archbishop stated that would lead one to believe that death, starvation, radiation etc., as the result of war are not serious matters. The discussion of the article is not a question of which is worse: abortion or the results of war.  If you would like to discuss that aspect, I&#8217;d be glad to do that &#8211; &#8211; but let&#8217;s stick to the article.  The Church has stated time and time again (and you should certainly know this if you&#8217;re a Catholic and follow what&#8217;s been going on in the world and in the Church) that  the Church has always spoken out forcefully about the evils of an unjust war, and the people responsible will have to answer to God. In fact, the Church speaks out forcefully about any war, as you should know. So in an attempt to keep the discussion on the topic as my previous posting suggested, comparing abortion to war  and suggesting that the this Archbishop values the lives of fetuses more than the lives of those who are slaughtered in wars is totally unjustified and as &#8220;wild&#8221; as your comments about Iran in your earlier posting.  If you want a discussion on abortion, I&#8217;d be glad to take it up with you but please don&#8217;t muddy the discussion with    extraneous verbiage that reminds me of politicians in both parties :). Look forward to your reply to my previous posting!</p>

What some folk fail to realize is that it is the duty of clergy, ministers, and pastors to draw the line and confront hypocrites who proclaim the faith but don&#8217;t live it. It is not a Democrat versus Republican issue &#8211; it&#8217;s a human rights issue. People turn a blind eye to abortion because it&#8217;s &#8220;legal&#8221; genocide &#8211; you never see the faces of the victims.</p>

<p>Holy cr@p, you have to be kidding me.  &#8220;These people&#8230;force unwanted births on folks&#8221;?????  Yeah, Catholics and Republicans are going around impregnating people, sometimes via r@pe, sometimes via their magic powers of legislative impregnation.  What the h3ll are you smoking?  Pregnancy is almost always the result of two consenting adults making the conscious decision to a) not use birth control, b) not pull out, c) put themselves in that situation in the first place.  Really, what percentage of people who get pregnant do you actually believe didn&#8217;t know that was a possibility beforehand?</p>
<p>But your follow up is priceless: &#8220;It becomes the mother and fathers responsibilty to provide proper health coverage.&#8221;  It becomes their responsibility the moment the pants come off.  Who the h3ll should be responsible for a pregnancy created by two other people?  My God, the gall of Catholics and Republicans to expect people not only to not kill babies they created but then to expect those same people to provide for them?  That&#8217;s crazy!</p>
<p>So, you don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s beliefs should be used to legislate anyone else&#8217;s actions, huh?  I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of people who think murder, r@pe, assault and theft are perfectly acceptable.  I&#8217;d suggest you don&#8217;t complain if any of those happen to you because then you&#8217;d be imposing your beliefs on someone else and as you stated, that&#8217;s wrong.</p>

                        <p>The article singles out two top leaders in the Democratic party, Catholics, it does not site Republicans because the ones who were involved in the discussion were not Catholic, and therefore not subject to Church Law.

                        <p>Abortion isn&#8217;t legal genocide and should never be compared to it.<br />
People have different views on the creation of life. </p>
<p>Some people believe life begins the very moment of conception, some like myself feel that true life doesn&#8217;t begin until you are born into the world.</p>
<p>Genocide is the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national, racial, political, or cultural group.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry but unborn fetuses don&#8217;t fall under that definition of genocide. It would be more accurately described as a medical act.</p>
<p>You might not agree with abortion, but to decry it as legalized genocide and force millions of others to obey your point of view is ignorant.</p>
<p>People need to quit trying to legislate religious beliefs and views and keep them to discussions with your church buddies.</p>

                        <p>Greg,</p>
<p>You still don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have ANY problem at all with the Archbishop &#8216;correcting&#8217; the amoral misrepresentations of Catholic teaching by the Democrat politicians. In fact, I strongly agree with him and wonder what took him so long.</p>
<p>What I object to is the Archbishop&#8217;s establishing of an absolute EQUIVALENCE between a political party&#8217;s position on abortion ALONE as determining whether that party is a &#8220;party of life&#8221; or a &#8220;party of death&#8221;: in favor of abortion= &#8220;party of death&#8221;; against abortion= &#8220;party of life&#8221;&#8211;irrespective of the party&#8217;s positions which will likely lead to genocide as a result of war. [As far as I have been able to determine, the only real difference between Republicans and Democrats in the current election is the amount of TIME before the occurrence of the nuclear war: If McCain, then sooner; if Obama, then somewhat later (but probably only a few months). Their position vis-a-vis the Israel and Iran, for example is fundamentally identical.]</p>
<p>Furthermore, why does the Archbishop choose to make such a comment about abortion as, in some way, a *singular* evil (although I certainly sympathize with such a view), while failing to comment about the torture that has been committed by agents of the U.S. government, the &#8216;rendition&#8217; of prisoners by the United States to countries that employ torture, or the slaughter of civilians in Lebanon and Gaza (by the Israel), Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan? Clearly, this &#8220;Vatican official&#8221; does not consider these subjects as being of sufficient *importance* to be able to characterize a party as being a &#8220;party of death&#8221;. (Look at the role of Condoleezza Rice, for example, in the use of torture. And NO COMMENT from the Archbishop, as far as I know.)</p>
<p>He is, in fact, placing a *priority* upon abortion as worse than ANY other evil if he chooses that ONE criterion to characterize a party as a &#8220;party of death&#8221;.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t see how there can be any reasonable escape from this conclusion.</p>
<p>Now, with regards to Iran, I don&#8217;t particularly *care* (see my website) that my conclusions are not echoed by the Zionist mainstream media.</p>
<p>By censoring the Truth about the Doctrine of &#8220;resurrection&#8221;, the Zionist media is doing EVERYTHING it can to incite WARFARE between the United States/the Israel and Iran.</p>

                        <p>My head is spinning!  Last Sunday our parish hosted a lecture on &#8220;Faithful Citizenship&#8221; based on material published by the US Catholic Bishops that enumerate a whole set of issues including not only abortion but torture, genocide and fouling the planet upon which we all must survive&#8211;and clearly states that &#8220;Catholics must NOT be &#8216;single-issue&#8217; voters&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, this guy gets up in front of God and everybody, with the microphone of ecclesial authority, and says this.  Although the Church proudly proclaims its devine origin, sometimes it stumbles on the human frailty of its practical foundations.  This would appear to be one of those times.</p>

                        <p>In general abortion is an extremely gray area. In regards to Dave&#8217;s post: If the parents can&#8217;t afford to have children, then maybe they should learn a little more constraint in the bedroom, or look into other preventative measures which would in the long run be cheaper. Of course, we could always look to Mr. Swift&#8217;s solution to the problem and start eating babies after they are born. That should solve many of the world&#8217;s starvation issues. Please note: This comment is made in the same tone as the original proposal put forth by Mr. Swift.</p>
<p>That being said, I will say that there are a couple of exceptions that should be made when deciding on the legality of abortion. One being impregnated by rape, another being health issues. Should a woman be raped and thereby concieve a child, it is unreasonable to as her to bear the fruits of the violation that was made against her. Also, should the life of a woman be threatened by the fetus, and the removal thereby save her life, it should be undertaken.</p>
<p>And I find it highly ironic that the security word that I had to type in to post this was &#8220;love&#8221;.</p>

<p>Where in this article did you see anything about the church telling people how to vote?  It seems you don&#8217;t believe in freedom of religion.  You don&#8217;t think the church should be allowed to state its position on &#8220;Catholics&#8221; who support abortion.  Biden and Pelosi can vote however they want.  Your implication that that somehow means the Church has to welcome them, otherwise lose their tax-exempt status shows just how asinine most liberal thinking is.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about the same as you claiming I&#8217;ve starved you because you&#8217;re allergic to everything in my pantry.  I&#8217;m not forcing you to eat at my house, but if you&#8217;d like to, you&#8217;ll eat what I give you.  Get it?</p>
<p>So should Obama&#8217;s church lose its tax exempt status or do you only spew BS like that when it&#8217;s a republican issue?</p>

The exact qoute was that the party risked &#8220;transforming itself definitively into a party of death for its decisions on bioethical issues.&#8221;<br />
Bioethical issues would range far more than just abortion.<br />
I think that the real issue for the bishop is the hypocrisy displayed by prominient Democratic Catholics, in that they claim to be devout Catholics, yet their policy dictates otherwise. It is unreasonable to believe that whatever eithics guide a Politician, (if any), is not in some way influenced by their personal religious choices. The bishop&#8217;s declamation of the Democrat Catholics has more to do with church politics than anything else.</p>

                        <p>Church Views were distorted by individuals in high profile lifestyles(whom entire countries hear). The Vatican corrected the erroneous views of church doctrine, because those who distorted the Church standards were not likely to give explanation if corrected. They surely wouldn&#8217;t recant as loudly as they gave their personal views.  The church was wise to correct it personally and solidly.  Agree or disagree with it, they have a right to correct misinformation that is aimed directly at them. &#8220;Every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment THOU shalt condemn&#8221;.</p>

                        <p>Michael, I don’t intend to repeat myself, my position re your extravagant out-of-the- ballpark postings is clear in my two previous postings.  I do “get it”! Insofar as your most recent posting, let me try to make it simple so that you can “get it”.  The article that started this conversation should stand on its own.  Here in plain view and in context is what the article stated about Archbishop Burke (direct quotes from the article):<br />
1. U.S. Democratic Party risked “transforming itself definitively into a party of death for its decisions on bioethical issues.”<br />
2. He then attacked two of the party’s most high profile Catholics — vice presidential candidate Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — for misrepresenting Church teaching on abortion.<br />
3. He said Biden and Pelosi, “while presenting themselves as good Catholics, have presented Church doctrine on abortion in a false and tendentious way.”<br />
4. Burke said pro-life Democrats were “rare” and that it saddened him that the party that helped “our immigrant parents and grandparents” prosper in America had changed so much over the years.<br />
5. Burke’s criticism isn’t limited to Democrats. Last year, he accused singer Sheryl Crow of being “a high profile proponent of the destruction of innocent lives” for defending a woman’s right to have an abortion and for being a proponent of stem cell research. He resigned as head of a children’s medical charity that featured the singer for a benefit concert.<br />
Now, Michael, without introducing your abortion/war arguments, just control yourself and let us know which of the 5 quotes above you don’t agree with &#8211; &#8211; (and keep in mind it is this article that we are discussing)? It’s as simple as that. As I indicated earlier, if you would like to discuss abortion vs. war, I will be happy to accommodate you. But please don’t introduce and misrepresent both the Archbishop and the Church’s statements and/or positions on abortion vs. war which are not even in the article nor do they exist. Do you get it?</p>

The bishop is from St. Louis, i.e.: a United States city.</p>
<p>And Tammy dear, take a look at the Catholic Church&#8217;s own history. Try at about 1100 AD through the Reformation. Very interesting politics, with many a murder and intrique, all bent on increasing the power and wealth of the Church. Not to mention the Babalonian Captivity, as well as that little period in which there were three popes all trying to wrest power from the others.</p>

                        <p>Speaking of Sarah Palin, there are two questions I’d like to see put to Ms. Palin during Thursday’s V.P. debate, or in her next interview (if she ever has another). </p>
<p>Actually, Gibson or Couric (let’s forget Murdoch’s &#8220;hired-hand Hannity&#8221;) should have already asked these questions:</p>
<p>1.) Why did you as mayor of Wasilla force female rape-victims reporting the crime to pay out of their own pocket for the forensic-kit and exam needed in the work-up (see NYT 9/26/08)?</p>
<p>2.) Was your policy of requiring rape-victims to pay for their own forensic exams a result of your publicly stated belief that even women who become pregnant as a result of rape should be required to carry that pregnancy to full term and birth?</p>
<p>I see no reason why Palin, as candidate for the office of Vice President of the USA, and with a 1 in 3 chance of taking over as President in the next 4 years, should continue to be shielded from answering these questions publicly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also be interested in Archbishop Raymond Burke&#8217;s position on these two questions. </p>
<p>His intervention for the Republican Party in this election reminded me of another Church figure, Cardinal Spellman, who in the early  1960&#8217;s put pressure on politicians to back the corrupt Diem Regime in South Vietnam with more troops. That advice was followed, and ultimately resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of American lives, and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese lives. </p>
<p>How many lives will be lost when McCain bombs Iran, and with what will follow that action? </p>
<p>Respect for life &#8211; really? Hardly.</p>

                        <p>I&#8217;m sorry. Well not really. But if you believe that life truly begins at birth, then you must think it&#8217;s o.k. to kill a baby while the mother is in labor right? Isn&#8217;t that right Dave? Which is it? A fetus? Or a 7 pound, 8 ounce baby in the birth canal? It&#8217;s o.k. to murder them?</p>
<p>If you want, we can nevermind religion for a moment. How about basic morality that you may have been associated with (giving the benefit of the doubt here) at an early age and now have obviously dismissed as irrational? I&#8217;m curious.</p>

                        <p>One only needs to read the comments posted here to have a clear understanding of everything that is amiss in the world today.  It is mindblowing that so many people can actually compare the brutal slaughter of innocent children to any kind of war.  But, just for the sake of argument, lets go with that for a moment.  Using this logic, executing innocent children would still be wrong because in the United States alone, there have been more deaths from executing children (49 million plus) than from all of the world&#8217;s wars combined!  Which just goes to show that it&#8217;s not about what is right, and it never has been, it is about men and women humping like animals in a free and unrestrained manner &#8211; with no consequences for their sin.</p>

<p>The Catholic church has the worst leadership of any organization I know of. They need to stop being so timid and do their job and their main job is to defend the faith. For a start reissue that letter written by pope Benedict.</p>

                        <p>Where&#8217;s the call to take away the tax exempt status of say the Black Churches when they express their political beliefs?  The Catholic Church has just as much right to preach to its members as any other organization has to preach to its members.  Has Tom Bellhouse, above, complained about the revolt of the Pastors who are defying the IRS by exercising their Freedom of Speech?  I don&#8217;t know what it is about the Catholic Church, but people will go absolutely bonkers when the Church speaks up about anything.  Like in the detective programs on TV &#8211; the guilty ones are the ones who yell their innocence the loudest.  Hey, the pro choice would like to make everyone pro choice so what&#8217;s wrong with the pro lifers wanting to make everyone pro lifers?</p>

If you aren&#8217;t ready for a kid, and cant afford to have a kid, don&#8217;t have sex.  Simple.  Short.  Consise.  The choice to have sex, comes with the possible outcome of having a kid.

                        <p>The whole, then don&#8217;t have kids debate is non-sensical and only applies to those who were irresponsible in their lives.</p>
<p>It completely leaves out rape victims, instances where the birth could lead to the death of the mother, and yes accidents DO happen and there in lies my point.</p>
<p>If a woman and man choose to have sex, do so with protection, and yet still end up pregnant it is an accident. Should they be forced to bear this child that they had attempted to prevent from happening in the first place?<br />
Is it your or anyone else&#8217;s choice what that woman decides to do in her life?</p>
<p>Is it not she and she alone who must deal with her decision and the reprecussions of said decision?</p>
<p>Nate, acting like those who don&#8217;t want kids should never have sex in the first place is idiotic. That thinking will NEVER work. It&#8217;s the whole abstinence argument all over again. We are human, we enjoy sex and we will continue to enjoy and have it and it will never be something that is ONLY for procreation. It&#8217;s admirable if you live that way, however it&#8217;s ignorant to expect the billions of other humans to follow your example.</p>
<p>I myself had a child very young that I was unprepared for and had no intentions of having at the time. The condom broke and now he&#8217;s 8. We made a choice to live with our mistake. That was our choice to make though, and not something I would have wanted forced on us.</p>
<p>Just as we chose to have the baby, another couple may choose to have an abortion or to give the baby up for adoption. That is their right to make that choice and no one should force any one decision on them.</p>

                        <p>First, There are those who say you should not mix religion with politics or you should not force your religious/political views on person.  The irony in this does not go unnoticed.  Religion is the biggest contributing factor to shaping a persons opinion.  Allow me to repeat that, “Religion is the biggest contributing factor to shaping a persons opinion.”  Should I do as several people state and refrain from voicing my religious beliefs then I also refrain from voicing my opinion.  I am also being asked not to vote, but yet if I don’t vote then I would be told to shut-up because I did not vote; essentially placing me in a Catch-22.  The irony is that those who tell me to keep my religion, or beliefs, to myself are the very ones forcing their belief, or religion, on me.  In other words you wish for me to remain silent while you shout from the top of the hills your beliefs, because you fear opposition, to lazy to take a stand, or possible fear your whole world will crumble if you discover the information you have is unable to stand using logic.</p>
<p>Second, There seem to be a lot of people that are experts on Catholicism; but hardly any who actually practice the faith.  So many people here are up in arms and spewing unintelligent, misinformed information about the Catholic Faith, Christianities oldest denomination (read your history if you doubt this).  The Church holds that ALL life is precious, just like God does, and that everyone is capable of redemption no matter how serious the sin is, just like God does. My thoughts were like many of those who think they know Catholicism, and all those thoughts were developed from people who were not Catholic or had some kind of selfish grudge against the Church; but it was not until I met a Catholic who really understood their faith and patiently explained it to me.  Through my process of converting and even to this day I experience a lot of pain and suffering, but I have yet to find anything that is as comforting, beautiful, and peaceful as what has been passed from our Lord to His Church.  Please, speak with an educated mind and not one that is derived from idiocy.</p>
<p>Third, Abortion is the action of taking a human life.  If you can not see this then it is because you chosen a selfish nature for sexual pleasure.  Whether it is for yourself or the couple that already has four kids and can not afford a fifth one.  The true is abortion is being used as a means of birth control so people can have sex without worrying about the consequences of their action.  Besides the religious reasons, a person should abstain from sex if they are unwilling to accept the responsibilities of raising a child.  It is through lust, that a person cultivates and feeds, a person becomes a slave to the sexual impulses.  You say kill the baby that is growing inside the woman because you are unable to except the what you helped create; I say abstain from sex so the choice does not need to be made.  For those who say that life does not begin until after birth I would love to sit down discuss why you have chosen this position, to hear what you have to say and try to understand why you think that way, for what how has the baby changed from the time before birth to the time after birth?</p>
<p>Fourth, Should tax exemption be revoked from religious organization?  No, It is called the first amendment for it allows the freedom of speech and religion.  In the case described in this article the Church has performed the correct action.  The politicians that claim to be Catholic but continue to speak publicly against the doctrines of the their faith should be corrected, and efforts were made to correct them in private as well as general statements made public by the Vatican regarding the Churches stance.  These same people that claim to be Catholic simple do so receive the votes of Catholics; therefore, the Church has a duty to call out publicly those that are misleading the faithful without recourse.</p>
<p>Remember if there is no God then how can person claim to be an atheist for an atheist denies the existence of God, so God has to exist in order for an atheist to deny His existence.</p>

                        <p>It is so predictable to see people change the subject when abortion is the issue.  You wonder why they need to do that.  My theory is that they vote for &#8220;pro-choice&#8221; candidates and have a hard time rationalizing their vote with their religious beliefs.</p>

                        <p>[quote : start]<br />
My head is spinning! Last Sunday our parish hosted a lecture on “Faithful Citizenship” based on material published by the US Catholic Bishops that enumerate a whole set of issues including not only abortion but torture, genocide and fouling the planet upon which we all must survive–and clearly states that “Catholics must NOT be ’single-issue’ voters”.</p>
<p>Now, this guy gets up in front of God and everybody, with the microphone of ecclesial authority, and says this. Although the Church proudly proclaims its devine origin, sometimes it stumbles on the human frailty of its practical foundations. This would appear to be one of those times.</p>

<p>Art,</p>
<p>You are mixing two subjects that should be kept separate, but when we vote we are asked to view everything in priority; so legalizing abortion would take precedence over legalizing the selling of sex.</p>
<p>The Archbishop is actually doing his duty by addressing those who publicly proclaim to be Catholic but speaking out publicly against the teachings of the Church.  Your comment makes the statement that when one official speaks out against a contradiction to the doctrines of out faith they should address all of them at the same time.  This is a ridiculous claim and not feasible for as soon as a person started talking everyone would run.  <img src="http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

                        <p>Abortion is murder for convenience sake, there can be no other interpretation, not in God&#8217;s or Man&#8217;s eyes. Margarette Sanger established Planned Parenthood as a means of practicing eugenics in America. Her goal was to reduce the number of African-Americans, which she considered a degenerate race. Abortion equates with genocide, in principle and practice. The &#8220;right to choose&#8221; (to murder one&#8217;s fetus) was also seen as a the means for women to partake in casual sex without consequences. This &#8220;right&#8221; was mistakenly thought to elevate a woman&#8217;s sexual status to equal that of men &#8211; who can have sex without concern of pregnancy. However, the psychological damage of &#8220;abortion guilt&#8221; was not accounted for. That guilt, preys on a woman&#8217;s subconscious, and results in the emotional reaction we see to pro-life advocates, such as Sarah Palin, et al.  Naturally, this condition also transfers to certain irresponsible and infantile libertine men who desire promiscuous sex without commitment. Abortion allows these men to transfer all prophylactic and birth control responsibility to the woman. Abortion is but another degradation heaped upon women for the benefit of the immoral or emotionally disturbed class.</p>

                        <p>The party of death.  Yes, but why do Democrats take a Pro-Abortion position?  It is puzzling. Even when a women&#8217;s &#8220;choice&#8221; is  Life for the innocent, they oppose an demonize those that do.  Democrats choose life for the guilty (no death penalty) and life for the monsters (tyrants and dictators that provoke war.  Their position makes no sense to an individual.  Of course, the individual is not important unless it is supporting the state.</p>

                        <p>I&#8217;m glad Archbishop Burke is forcefully enunciating Church doctrine on bioethical issues.  Too many Catholic legislators are claiming that their informed Catholic consciences allow them to be for abortion, embryonic stem cell research, and euthanasia.  They&#8217;ve not been challenged until now, perhaps because none of them have publicly enunciated the false reasoning which led them to their conclusion.  The misrepresentation of Saint Augustine&#8217;s views by Pelosi and Biden were, I think, the last straws.  To have high ranking Catholic politicians misstating Catholic theology as put forth by a Doctor of the Church just begged for correction.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s come.  These people need to get a copy of the Bible and the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and sit down (preferably with a study group at their local parish) and begin to truly understand the faith of their fathers.</p>

                        <p>Pregnancy is always a possible consequence of sex when a woman is of childbearing age.  Even if you favor abortion, why should that right be absolute? How can anyone justify a late abortion?  Yet, the pro-choicers were vehemently opposed to the Partial Birth Abortion ban.  How also can anyone morally justify abortions because a child will be born with Down Syndrome or other birth defects?  What does that have to do with a woman&#8217;s right to choose? The woman in such cases presumably chose  to carry a &#8220;perfect&#8221; child to term. Does the right to choose extend to a woman&#8217;s right to choose to have a child without birth defects (or the wrong sex, which happens in China and India)?</p>

                        <p>The Pope, as herder of the flock of followers has not only the right, but the obligation to make sure the church followers are not violating the teachings of Jesus Christ as Son of God. He is not addressing or forcing non church members to abide by the church laws. Pelosi, Biden and Kennedy profess to be church members of the Catholic Faith.</p>
<p>The Bishops serve are arms of the Pope. Therefore any person who professes to believe in God and is a member of the church must follow the teachings of the church or face refusal of the church sacraments. It just so happens that it is the Democrat Party with Ms Pelosi and Mr Biden who are blaspheming the church by false statements. So yes the Democrat party is the party of Death in America, with over 40,000,000 babies, yes that is correct, over 40 million babies murdered under the disguise of Choice in the last ten years. Yes, 7 babies killed a second, mostly by middle class whites and thousands per year were 3rd and 4th abortions. So bad that the DNC sued with ACLU to stop record keeping of the just lazy birth control methods. And then the DNC makes such a fuss about deaths defending the freedoms of America!! What most people do not know is the abortion doctor performs the operation for 200 dollars and then sells the aborted babies to Embroy Stem Cell research labs for upwards of 2,000 dollars. Abortion on Demand is a Business of Death supported by the Democrat Party of Death in United States of America.</p>

                        <p>Really, the country is facing multi-generational issues on many fronts &#8211; The Church should teach as is its right and obligation but not weigh into politics over the heads of its lay faithful who have the duty and obligation to make prudential judgements in the secular political world.  There are so many ways to preach but the finest is done with the life of the preacher.  Unfortunately the Church has lost a lot of credibility because of the many scandals that they allowed to happen.  So let the Bishops do their work in building up the Church and if they do their job, the laity will build a polity according to just principles.  </p>
<p>As far a criticizing Nancy Pelosi who raised her children before becoming a politician.  Or Joseph Biden, who is a family man himself.  Anyone who has lived in the disfunctional American Catholic church for the past 45 years and should be applauded for staying in and not criticized for living their life according to their conscience.  </p>
<p>Maybe the Bishops should listen to ST. Francis of Assisi who told his brothers to &#8216;Preach the Gospel always, and when necessary use words&#8217; &#8211; with emphasis on teaching by their lives not their words.</p>

                        <p>This is an article on abortion&#8211;not on &#8220;choice&#8221;.  Any thinking person believes that Hitler&#8217;s murder of 6 million innocent Jews was a monstrous crime against humanity.  There have been over 44 million murders&#8211;abortions&#8211;of innocent babies&#8211;not &#8220;fetusus&#8221;&#8211;in the U.S.A. in the last 40 years.  How many more murders will it take until &#8220;thinking&#8221; liberals believe that too many have died for convenience&#8217;s sake?</p>
<p>The religious position is correct&#8211;regardless of one&#8217;s belief in God or not.  And any Christian who stands before God on the final day will have a very hard time explaining their support of abortion&#8211;and their voting for candidates who support and / or this horror.</p>
<p>I will not vote for a candidate who supports abortion&#8211;I am afraid of Hell.</p>

                        <p>Biden&#8217;s statement that he would not legislate his religious views on others is simple-minded bunk.  Simply stated, the laws against murder are based upon moral foundations.  This is no less true of the law against abortion.  The active, intentional, or negligent killing of another human being is wrong. Period.  And, that is not imposing any one religion on another person.  It is the essence of providing for the peace of society and the security of each person.  The kid in the womb of a mother is not a blob of flesh subject to whim and fancy, but a human being with rights.</p>

                        <p>The Catholic church has never expected that 1 billion human beings are all going to be perfectly abstinant and follow the teachings of Jesus.  That is why the church has the sacrament of penance.  People are going to sin and the church knows this and make no excuses for it.  But the teachings of Jesus are what they are.  It is hypocritical, when a public official makes a point to let the public know that he is a member of the Catholic (meaning &#8216;universal&#8217;) church, but somehow doesn&#8217;t feel like their beliefs extend to the entire human population; then, what do they really believe?  And why are they bothering to label themselves as Catholic?</p>

                        <p>Roe vs Wade decriminalized abortion for the Doctor, never made it OK for the Mother to Murder her baby. The Christian church teaches life starts at the moment of conception. No ands, ifs, or buts about it. Aborting the baby  is murder, goes against thou shall not kill. I nor anyone else will say Joe Biden or Ms Pelosi are doomed to hell. Just that they are trying to tell the sheep that the Catholic Church DOES NOT TEACH LIFE BEGINS AT MOMENT OF CONCEPTION. This is blasphemy and must be dealt with. One does not have to say Democrat Party of Death,<br />
one only has to say Party of Death. Then one asks, what Party condones Abortion? Dah. is not Independents, is not Green, is not Republicans, etc, only one left is Democrat. Look at their party platform. Listen to Cathy Couric asking Sarah Palin? One does not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out which Party is the party of Death!! Does not just apply to babies either. How about the little gal on life support in Florida the Republicans could not get Democrat support to stop the Court ordered execution? You remember Schiavo feeding tube removal in 2005? But at the same time Democrats with try to stay the jury ordered execution of a multi person murderer, don&#8217;t make logical sense at all.<br />
I will never forget Gore lawyer at the Florida Supreme Court arguing &#8220;Who is listening to the voices of the Hanging Chats&#8221;, and I thought &#8220;who is listening to the voices of the little baby about to be killed by abortion on demand&#8221;. 40 million babies aborted in ten years is just crazy. And is in America founded for LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. Is a Farce.</p>

                        <p>If you take a political job such as senator, governor, representative, mayor, president, vice president, ANY appointed spot, you are agreeing to represent the people who elected you and not your church or your religious views.</p>
<p>The seperation of church and state was created for a few reasons. One was to allow freedom of religion and a state sponsored religion would be in direct contrast with freedom of religion.</p>
<p>It is quite fine for the church to spread it&#8217;s beliefs and values. That&#8217;s part of the religious freedom we ALL enjoy.</p>
<p>However it is a seperate issue entirely when politicians begin legislating their religious doctrines on an entire society of people. By accepting office, these politicians are affirming that they will seperate their religion from their civic duties.</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not abortion is wholly a religious/moral debate, and not everyone is in agreeance. </p>
<p>You have the freedom of choice to not ever take part in the practice you deem un-holy and evil, so you&#8217;ve already made your decisions. But don&#8217;t get all savior and believe you need to make abortions illegal. Let God judge those people that choose to make that choice, since it&#8217;s a sin and all and only God can judge.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s funny is how the Church is so against abortions because they are supremely pro-life. What&#8217;s so hysterical about that is that the Church is responsible for more death over the last few thousand years than any other institution.</p>
<p>Look up all the religious wars that have claimed millions of lives. From the Crusades to modern day, war and death created in the name of God, Allah, and other religions haven taken a huge toll on human life.</p>

                        <p>Scientists know when life begins in the womb so that&#8217;s no longer an excuse.<br />
At this very moment, babies are being partially delivered, having their brains suctioned out, heads crushed, and being delivered dead.  Many of them would be fully funtional babies and could grow up to be wonderful people.<br />
In this country, abortions are done in which babies are born alive and left to die.  Ask any nurse who works where abortions are performed.<br />
You are voting for a man who has voted to support all of this without a blink.<br />
Give this more than a thought if you are able.</p>
<p>Religious people, including priests and pastors, have every right &#8211; check the Constitution &#8211; to discuss religious beliefs wherever they wish.  You just don&#8217;t like what they are saying.  My pastor can&#8217;t MAKE me vote for anyone, but he has a right to talk about elections issues and the positions that he believes in.  Otherwise, you are removing his rights.  Is that okay with you too?<br />
The people who wrote the Constituion knew that religion was very necessary to society.  Check their letters &#8211; there is lots of history out there about their beliefs.</p>

                        <p>Liberals try to sidetrack the truth with idiotic sidebars about war.  What Bishop Burkd is referring to the doctrine of the Catholic church with respest to when life begins.  We hold that life begins at conception, something which Joe Biden states that he believes also.  Pelosi has no idea what she is taling about, trying to refer to St. Augustine.  Where is her degree in theology.  This truth has existed in the faith for 2000 years.  If you cannot respect life at it most elemental, what good are all your so-called programs.  Also, I think it shows a degree of arrogance to want to kill a child, while you so smugly enjoy your own existence.  Whether you will admit it or not, Barack Obama fought the bill that would aid those children born as a result of a botched abortion.  He promotes infanticide, not a very messianic stance to take.</p>
<p>Also, you need to speak to those children who find out that their sibling(s) was aborted.  They wonder, why not me?</p>
<p>It is NOT the woman&#8217;s body.  She is carrying a body within.  These arguments are a case of misguided compassion.  The situation of Down&#8217;s Syndrome children was brought to light in an episode of Quincyt ME, A doctor allowed a Down&#8217;s Syndrome child to die in this episode, and Dr. Quincy discovered that it was an abvious case of murder.  In this episode there were children with that syndrome, acting and it was brought to light that they are not only trainable, but educable as well.  Life goes on had a Down&#8217;s Child who was mainstremed in school and played a character named Corky Thatcher.  These children are loving, and good-natured and have a RIGHT TO LIFE!!  Trouble is that feminists don&#8217;t want to be bothered.  Don&#8217;t want that less thsn perfect child.  Baby Louise, the test tube baby blew a big part of Roe V. Wade, because she proved that the fertilized egg could be viable in a test tube as opposed to the womb.  That was a huge point in R V W., fetal viability.  It is easy to be smug when your parent chose your life.</p>
<p>And, just for your information the  Vatican spoke out against the Iraq war.</p>

                        <p>Part of the scandals of the Church arose out of the 60s and being told by the APA (American Psycholigical Association) that behaviors could be rehabilitated.  Why do you think that we are still fighting against sexual predators.  Just look at the issues with Vermont not passing Jessica&#8217;s law.</p>
<p>Plus let us put abortion into a more recognizable perspective.  Take the Kennedy family for example.  Their sister Rosemary was born simple, I hate the word retarded. Her father had her lobotomized and made things much worse.  Yet, she did give joy to her family in her simplicity.  What if Rose Kennedy took the option to abort her, knowing how her daughter would suffer.<br />
Segue to John F. Kennedy.  His Addison&#8217;s disease was kept a secret.  We now have ways to identify the gene that identifies the disease.  If Joe and Rose Kennedy knew, and that the disease would elaborate at the age of 13 in John Kennedy, they might have chosen to abort him, so that he would not have to suffer.  And, lastly Ted Kennedy, the ninth child.  What if Rose said to Joe, &#8220;We already have 8 kids and I don&#8217;t want another baby, I am getting too old, don&#8217;t want morning sickness, don&#8217;t want to get fat again.  Then, where would we be?</p>
<p>Abortion is just a matter of women, relegating their children to the nature of a product.  The abortion result is referred to as the products of conception, no Janey, Tiffany, Dave, but a product.  And they are referred to as &#8220;Therapeutic abortions&#8221;.  How is saline burning a child, therapeutic?  And for whom?  Or, shredding the curretage through curretage?  The neural tube is developed in the 1th week.  I gurantee you that the child feels pain.  Plus partial-birth abortion.  The child is delivered breach, feet first, which is a way that many woman died in childbirth in the past.  Then the child in removed and the brain is crushed.  Pleasant, huh.</p>
<p>Women need to grow up and afford their children the same rights that they fought for.  That screeching argument that it is my body is idiotic.  The whole thing in a nutshell is that they do not WANT the child.  The sexual revolution of the 60s had led to irresponsible adults. we went from a mere 5 STDs to a whopping 28!  For those of you:  that is sexually transmitted diseases.  How about teaching your children some personal responsibility?  How about the baby boomers getting off the acid and acting more mature.</p>
<p>After 9/11, people went back to Church because they found solace in their faith.  Maybe we need to act like every day is 9/11, because you never know when you are going to need God.</p>

                        <p>This is my problem with organized religion.  You must accept dogma or you really aren&#8217;t a real or practicing member of that faith.  Given the Catechism of the Catholic church is about two inches thick (last I saw it) that is a lot to swallow while suspending your own mental processes.</p>
<p>When are we going to quit letting everyone else (church, government, commercials with lots of boobies etc., corporations, political parties) do all of our thinking for us?</p>
<p>Personally I think the people singled out should simply quit the Church.  Much cleaner and more honest.</p>

<p>You think you can force Mommy and Daddy to take good care of a child if they do not wish to do so?</p>
<p>Unfortunatly, more cases that not, what will happen is that the child will be murdered by their parents after a while anyway.  </p>
<p>No?  What parent could do that?  Children are killed by parents every day&#8230;  Homicide is one of the leading causes of death of children under age four.  </p>
<p>So make them give birth and give them the choice to sin first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our Constitution was made only for a religious and moral people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is both a good thing and a sad thing that the Catholic Church speaks alone on moral ssues when there is a deafening silence from all other quarters.  Killing a child because you cannot enact enough self control or have such a lax moral compass is beyond discusting.  People in the country want to scream about freedom but are silent and resentful of the tradeoff that must occour, responsibility.</p>

                        <p>So, how about this: let&#8217;s actually implement Catholic social teaching across the board and not just on abortion ? </p>
<p>For libs this means no abortion, no gay rights </p>
<p>For cons this means no big military all over the world just one at home for defense, no executions and tax rates plus government intervention in the market like nobody&#8217;s business in the name of social justice. </p>
<p>For all no sex outside of marriage, no contraceptives plus a return to the office of the censor and the guardian of the public morals to make sure that all media and arts pass moral muster. In addition, say bye bye to sunday shopping. You will be searched for porn and contraceptives on the way into the country, mass will be televised at least once a week, catholic church figures will be major celebrities and appear on the serious talk shows, and the angelus will be on thrice daily at the appropriate times. Why we might even estabilish facilities where the wayward women could work off their sins in this life&#8230;.</p>
<p>How many of you want to sign up for all of this because this is what it means to live in a fully Catholic country ? </p>
<p>If we are to implement Catholic social teaching, let&#8217;s implement it wholesale or leave it out totally.</p>

                        <p>Nice to see the hopelessly partisan bigots are out in force.</p>
<p>Abortion is prohibited clearly by the Roman Catholic Church&#8217;s teachings on human life. Support for at-will abortion is seen as a clear moral violation without room for differing opinions on the life or value of an unborn child. It is an issue restricted exclusively to Faith and Morals.</p>
<p>War is not. The invasion of Afghanistan was not protested by the Vatican. The Holy See did venture forth a geo-political opinion that war against Saddam Hussein did not meet the criteria of a just war. It was not, however, judged to be a clear moral violation and Catholics are understood to have differing opinions on the Geo-Political realities leading up to operation Iraqi Freedom (rather than Faith and Morals).</p>
<p>As long as the Democratic Party puts Abortion-at-Will as a plank on its platform it will have to deal with the scorn of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church&#8217;s rebukes against politicians who claim to be Catholic and then misrepresent Church Teachings on Abortion or vote contrary to the moral stance of the Church on Abortion.</p>

                        <p>I am always amazed by those who say it is wrong or unethical to legislate ones&#8217; religous views on others, and then equate that with being opposed to legalized abortion.  Abortion is not a religious issue, any more than burglary, assault and battery, or perjury are religious issues.  Yes, the Bible teaches &#8220;Thou shalt not lie&#8221; and &#8220;Though shalt not steal.&#8221;  But that doesn&#8217;t mean that theft and perjury should be legal &#8211; beause we don&#8217;t want to &#8220;legislate&#8221; our &#8220;religious views&#8221; on others.</p>
<p>Abortion involves the taking of a human life.  This is not a matter fo faith, but of scientific fact.  just what, if not a human being, is the offspring of two human beings, created by procreation?  It is not a &#8220;fetus&#8221; &#8211; it is a human being.  It simply makes us feel less guilty calling unborn life a &#8220;fetus&#8221; &#8211; and it also helps that we do not actually see the child.  That is precisely why those who support legalized abortion are so angry when photos of an abortion are publicized.  </p>
<p>If a human being is legally declared dead when there is the absence of brainwaves and a heartbeat, why is a human being &#8211; who is growing and replicating cells &#8211; and has a heartbeat and brainwaves, not considered a human being simply because the child is in a mother&#8217;s womb?</p>
<p>When someone has sexual intercourse, they are inviting life to start and take hold.  To allow the unborn child to be killed, because the child represents an inconvenience to those who sought the gratification of sex, is the epitome of evil.  It is akin to child sacrifice at the alter of hedonism.  We want to engage in sex without consequences.  So, we call a living child a &#8220;fetus&#8221; and pretend it&#8217;s really just a &#8220;religious&#8221; issue.  Being against abortion is no different than being against any other form of murder.  By making murder illegal, we are not imposing a religious view on society &#8211; we are protecting innocent life.  The same is true on the abortion question.  </p>
<p>So, when someone like Biden says they are &#8220;personally opposed to abortion,&#8221; it begs the question &#8211; &#8220;why?&#8221;  If it truly represents the taking of human life, then you should not simply be against it &#8220;personally,&#8221; you should adamantly demand that your government protect the innocent life.</p>
<p>Again, this isn&#8217;t a religious issue.  It is a matter of fact and logic.  And the phrase &#8220;abortion is murder&#8221; is not an article of faith &#8211; but simply a statement of fact.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s impossible to be anything other than a hypocrite when you are anti-war, anti-death penalty but pro-abortion.</p>
<p>All of the world&#8217;s wars, plus all of it&#8217;s executions, in a year don&#8217;t even add up to the number of kids that we murder in this country alone.</p>
<p>Republicans are also hypocrites when they support the aforementioned policies but they&#8217;re not even close to the amount of blood that the Democrats are swimming in.</p>
<p>&#8230;the fact that Democrats &#8220;celebrate&#8221; this and call it a &#8220;right&#8221; is all the more disturbing.</p>

                        <p>So many things to address. Many people think taking religion out of society would bring peace. Look at Pol Pot, Stalin, Idi Amin. If you look at your own personal life, you do not live up to the standards you profess. You have lied, cheated, protected yourself for your own aims. This is what is known as &#8220;sin&#8221;. The catholic church is absolutely in it&#8217;s rights to point out that those who support abortion, support murder.<br />
As far as a church losing it&#8217;s &#8220;tax status&#8221;, read the first admendment and you will see that Congress cannot interfere with the church. Also, the church answers to God. If you find that hard to swallow I would encourage you to look into the history of our country and see how many of the founders were ministers, held seminary degrees, that the Bible was used as a text book in schools, that the universities were based on the Bible.<br />
To become more informed, I would encourage you to read the works of David Barton, historian. Or, check out www.wallbuilders.com</p>

                        <p>The Church&#8217;s position on abortion is clear, and abortion is a non-negotiable issue to practicing Catholics who follow Church doctrine.  Democrats can&#8217;t have it both ways.  They are either pro life, in which case I as a Catholic can vote for them, or they are pro abortion, in which case I absolutely cannot vote for them.  Either way is fine.  What they can&#8217;t do is restate Catholic doctrine in an effort to convince people to vote for them.  I understand that rubs some people the wrong way.  Those people shouldn&#8217;t be Catholic.  Again, no problem.</p>

                        <p>For those that are saying that if a politician helps to legislate a pro-life law that would be like imposing their religious beliefs onto others, </p>
<p>Do you feel the same way about other laws legislated by politicians such as laws against murder? Is that imposing their religious beliefs also?</p>

                        <p>So, the Democratic party believes in killing kids before they come out and the Republican party believes in killing kids after they come out, ie the bombing of Iraq&#8217;s kids.  And if the U.S. can go in and kill a million Iraqis, what is your problem with Iran nuking a million Americans?  Your hypocrisy is astonishing to me.  Why don&#8217;t we just stop killing altogether.  As it is, we Americans are so without conscience, that we should just keep our mouth shut about the immorality of other nations.</p>

                        <p>to cd walker, nice try but you still don&#8217;t quite have the understanding to make your argument&#8230;.your reference to &#8220;thou shall not kill&#8221; is a misunderstanding you have of biblical translations. the better translation that would help you is that the literal meaning is &#8220;you shall not murder&#8221;. although no caring person would condone &#8220;murder&#8221; or &#8220;killing&#8221;, they are in fact two different things. to remove the fetus from the womb with a vacuum cleaner would be &#8220;murder&#8221;. to kill or be killed in war is &#8220;killing&#8221;. some simple minded people have a problem distinguishing from the two, i hope this helps you understand why your argument doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>

                        <p>frank, there are a LOT of organizations that should lose tax-exempt status by your definition. in the case of sierra club they just set up several subsidiaries under different status, like sierra club foundation, so they can &#8216;legally&#8217; lobby the heck out of congress. so the church could just follow that model. anyways, who cares about the political system. democrats are a monopoly of news, views, and politics in the u.s. and there adherents are more dogmatic than any &#8216;religion&#8217; on the planet. they will vote for comedians for senate, anything democrat voters will pull the lever for anyone with a d.</p>

                        <p>Using the commandment &#8220;Thou shalt not kill,&#8221; as a means of stereotyping every soldier in combat as a murderer is not legitimate. Just war theory by St. Thomas Aquinas clarifies what is in reality a very sensitive issue. Our fighting against terrorism began as a just war, and at this point, it would be morally irresponsible for the United States to up and leave. The situation left in our wake would be far more dangerous than the even extremely dangerous situation that existed when we entered Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>But also, I do not deny that the idea of abortion in cases of rape is very sensitive as well. What the Church does recognize though is that there are alternatives to killing a child because it is inconvienent or even against one&#8217;s own will. Even in the case of rape, the moral justification for having an abortion is very weak and does not carry much water.</p>

                        <p>There has never been a Constitutional separation of church and state. Only a requirement that congress shall pass no law establishing a state religion, in fact it requires a free expression thereof.<br />
If the dems want to think they can be good Catholics and still vote for abbortion, they are only fooling themselves.<br />
I don&#8217;t see how any Good Catholic could vote for a democrat any more than why 95% of blacks vote for them when the dems were the ones that fought against their civil rights, but the dems are the ones that give the hand outs to keep them dependent on government support and not being able to make it on their own.</p>

                        <p>Kudos to Archbishop Burke for speaking out on this fundamental moral issue.  Catholics in public office who publicly put themselves in opposition to clear church doctrine are not Catholics in good standing and should be barred from the sacraments.  It is a simple matter of church discipline.  If such persons persist in their public positions contrary to the faith, they should simply leave the church.  No big deal; the church can get along without them!</p>

                        <p>this makes my blood boil.  i&#8217;ll answer simply citing a well-argued piece in the national catholic reporter by a civil and canon lawyer, arguing that a pro-life perspective gives insufficient breadth for judging how to vote in this election.  the bishops themselves have pointed out the importance of weighing a candidate&#8217;s positions on just war and torture in addition to abortion.  obama has opposed torture and the iraq war, mccain has supported them.  extremists like burke distort the argument made by his own colleagues in favor of an out-of-kilter exclusivity of focus on abortion&#8211;an issue on which obama disagrees with the church in supporting choice, but on which he agrees on issues such as finding ways to decrease the number of abortions.  so much for simply citing the article.  when will the right wing in the church hierarchy stop trying to bludgeon the rest of the world with humanae vitae, and recognize that it serves as an obstacle to useful dialogue and progress?</p>

                        <p>Raymond Burke is a loon, and as a Catholic it disgusts me to see the Church getting involved in politics like this.  For one, people like Burke don&#8217;t seem to make a big deal about deaths in unnecessary wars like Iraq.  For two, they shouldn&#8217;t bring up political parties and who their congregations should be voting for.  Otherwise, they should lose their tax exempt status.</p>

Secondly, you equivocate the taking of innocent life to that of legal self defense and warfare. What crime do unborn children commit that deserves the death penalty? The democrat party has the blood of millions of children on it&#8217;s hands.</p>

                        <p>The Democrats do not have the high moral ground when it comes to war.</p>
<p>Anyone who gives the impression that Obama will NOT commit our armed forces to a conflict is either a liar or very foolish. If Obama is president, there will be plenty of scenarios where his advisors will lead him into a conflict that would prove unpopular.</p>
<p>Besides, what is your beef with the Catholic Church politically? Are you a buffoon? The US Catholic Church is riddled with social justice hypocrisy which you should just love. 47 years and I know more devout liberal democrats in the church than conservatives. Get a grip. My beef with the church is in regards to this social justice crap which very literally uses the threat or actual use of violence by law enforcement to take property from one citizen and give it to another. For the US Church it is hypocrisy, for the Democrats is further proof of moral bankruptcy.</p>

                        <p>Dave, old man. You are conflating multiple issues and have obviously been listening to the worst anti-Christian publicists. </p>
<p>First, there is nothing in orthodox Christianity or church canons, or even the Gospels, that says go out and commit unprovoked violence. Much as many leaders and individuals have abused religion for their own ends, that hardly nullifies any truth or benefits of the institution. That is like claiming the terrible behavior of Congress or the Clintons somehow refutes the institution of democracy and the Presidency. </p>
<p>Second, the Crusades were a pinprick inresponse to hundreds of years of Islamic expnasion (over formerly Christian and peaceful territories) and direct attacks against Europe. If anything, they were a rather anemic response. Even Islamic extremists have stopped dragging that one out. Third, as you seem to want to put much of the problem at the doorsteop of &#8220;the Church&#8221;, the religious wars of Europe right after the Reformation involved Catholics and Protestants. And many of those battles were fueled as much by poitically ambitious rulers as anything. And last we checked, &#8220;the Church&#8221; had very little to do with Islam and submission to Allah.</p>
<p>Last, the wars and genocide in the name of secular-atheist ideologies in the 19th and 20th centuries make the numerical death toll from anything else pale by comparison (Stalin, Lenin, Pol Pot, Nazism,&#8230;). So by your logic, we should silence all secular movements. Your argument is self-refuting.</p>
<p>Good day!<br />
&#8220;What’s so hysterical about that is that the Church is responsible for more death over the last few thousand years than any other institution.</p>
<p>Look up all the religious wars that have claimed millions of lives. From the Crusades to modern day, war and death created in the name of God, Allah, and other religions haven taken a huge toll on human life&#8221;</p>

                        <p>Please.  Let&#8217;s take the emotion out of the discussion and look at the facts and the actual teachings of the church.  There are so many misconceptions.  </p>
<p>Good people can debate whether or not the War on Terror is just or the best way to help the needy.  Science shows the unborn child has a heart beat at 22 days &#8211; that is not debatable.  With care and nurishment that unborn child will make it.  Just like you and I &#8211; if someone withheld our care and nurishment, we to would die.  Do our mothers have the right to end our lives because we may be inconvienent?</p>
<p>All this stems from the relativism.  Relativism just does not work.  Choosing your own morality does not work.  What if some crazy dictator came to power and decided based on his own ideals that all people of a certain ethincity or faith were not fit to survive and subsequently exterminate them?  Wait, that happened, his name was Hilter.  He dehumanized the Jews which allowed his soldiers to commit the atrocities of WWII.  The same is happening to our unborn.  </p>
<p>The right to life is guaranteed in the Declaration of Independence &#8211; remember that old thing?</p>

                        <p>It&#8217;s time to stand up to the fascist theocracy of the Catholic Church.  Just as they imprisoned Galileo for speaking the truth, the Catholic church today imposes itself on the secular world as though it is an authority.  It&#8217;s time for Catholics to break away and challenge this autocratic, unAmerican pseudo religion.  How dare the Vatican call the democrats the party of death.  The blood of hundreds of thousands of innocents are on the Vatican and the pope for their support for the true party of death: the neofascist neocon Republican party.</p>

                        <p>Yah, Its to bad the Democrats use to be a good party that really beleived in helping people. Hell even my Grandpa switch over to the Republican party last year and he&#8217;s from Arkansas??? The liberals have destroyed that party. No morals, anything anti-American is praised, spit on the Military, follow the Communist Manufesto, Tax the middle class out of existence even though they pay 88% of all of the taxes now??? Make government so hugh that it will take away our freedoms and Liberty. This true if you follow a History book and can read. Oh, and kill innocent babies. I know save the caribou, the ozone, but human beings we just can&#8217;t let that happen??? People&#8217;s Republic of San Fran. Pelosi has the worst Congress in History. I&#8217;d say the Democrats have dishonored themsleves and our a disgrace to our founding fathers and what they wanted. I have read it and it is true. How sad!</p>

                        <p>Dave,</p>
<p>  You and the others took the hook.  Who said that saving the life of a child is a religious issue?  There are more laws in this country to protect the eggs of Eagles than to protect the unborn.  So, are the eagle protectors religious wackos?  The Bible says &#8220;do not steal&#8221;, &#8220;Do not Murder&#8221;, &#8220;Do Not Cheat&#8221; and our society has chosen to put it in the laws should we abolish them also?  Oddly enough most of the teachings of the church are just plain common sense.</p>

                        <p>Non-sense. Probably in the back pocket of some rich Republican. I&#8217;m sorry but the Catholic church is a joke. Lets not talk about the countless rapes and &#8220;murders&#8221; they committed in their history. It is our law that it is legal. &#8220;Obey the law of the land, for all u Catholics.&#8221; I think the timing of this is just too perfect. Support a democrat &#8211; support abortion? I don&#8217;t usually say anything but too many ignorant people posting on this. </p>
<p>And I like all the comments on people going to hell. Catholics think everyone goes to hell but them. Some indigenous person who never heard of that religion&#8230;oh he is going to hell. A good Christian&#8230;oh that person is going to hell. You don&#8217;t think you might be the one going to hell?</p>

                        <p>Oh, we&#8217;re quoting the Bible now? Which came first, man or animal?</p>
<p>Genesis 1:24-26<br />
Then God said, &#8220;Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind&#8221;; and it was so.<br />
God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.<br />
Genesis 2:19 Then God said, &#8220;Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, [a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p> 19And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</p>
<p>And, why does Leviticus use a Polynesian word? (it&#8217;s a rhetorical question, please don&#8217;t answer)</p>

                        <p>To Dave, Michael Cecil, et al: Equivocating the article about abortion and the theoretical nuking of Iran is not apples to apples at all. Abortion is a decision to take a defenseless life when the child does not threaten the life of the mother. The decision to nuke Iran will be based on saving the lives of over 7,000,000 Israelis. While I am confident that the Almighty would not be happy with either, everybody knows theres a difference. </p>
<p>Insofar at who is the party of death, the Republicans want to kill the bad guys, Democrats push for the belief that there&#8217;s nothing wrong with Abortion. Since they&#8217;re more concerned with saving the worst criminals from the death penalty instead of the defenseless unborn, certainly not the party of the living.</p>

                        <p>I am a Catholic. I believe that life begins at conception. I believe that anybody who  claims to be a Catholic and does not believe that life begins at conception is a &#8220;Counterfiet Catholic&#8221;. The Catholic church in some instances makes it easy for a person to vote pro choice due to the fact that they say you don&#8217;t have to be a one issue person. This tells me that the church is not serious about abortion. They pay it lip service. All you have to do is follow the money. Bottom line the church does not want to loose the money by taking a solid stance. I guess some people look at it as getting rid of the child before they grow up to be poor or disabled.I see videos of the nazi death camps with bodies stacked one on another and think the only difference in this scenario and abortion is the poor little children that are aborted don&#8217;t take up as much space. The culture in this country is becoming more and more a culture of death.</p>

                        <p>Roman Catholic Democrats have a choice to make.  It&#8217;s the choice between a child&#8217;s life and death.  To hear many Democrats talk about the issue, if a child is still in the womb, she is fair game for abortion.  Even worse, now Sen. Obama has lent his support to infanticide by tacitly supporting the denial of medical attention to a child if she survives the abortionist and somehow manages to be born alive.  Feminists, secular progressives and liberal Democrats like Sen. Obama see no problem with taking a baby&#8217;s innocent human life for the sake of convenience.  Roman Catholic Democrats have a choice to make.  Do they choose Obama and his philosophy of death, or do they listen to their consciences and choose life for the unborn.</p>

                        <p>Using charity and discussing these issues with a clear unemotional mind always is best.  Using words like &#8220;fascist&#8221; really does not help (especially when it is used incorrectly).  Again, look at facts not your own perception of the facts.  It is funny how people who consider themselves &#8220;liberal&#8221; and &#8220;open minded&#8221; often are only open to those who believe what they believe. </p>
<p>Although I am a devout Catholic, I can take the religious aspect out of the discussion and look at what we are doing the weakest of the weak &#8211; the unborn.  They do not have a voice.  Our job as humans is to stand-up for the weakest of the weak &#8211; that is true kindness, charity and love for others.</p>

                        <p>Hello,<br />
The Catholic Archbishop taking to task Catholic Democratic lawmakers is perfectly within his right.   I was raised Catholic.  The Archbishop is doing his job.  I notice many complaining that because he went after two Democratic Catholics, his rights to free speech, and his church needed to loose their tax exempt status.  What RUBBISH.  I still have to tolerate your views, so what is the difference?</p>
<p>Since he went after the sacred cow of the liberal left, abortion, he is a heretic for their &#8220;religion.&#8221;  I am a human that believes in life.  I applaud young people that do the right thing when an accident occurs.  I pray for the young people that choose otherwise.</p>

                        <p>Ahmadinejad and Iran only want power plants and not nukes? I know this is off subject, but are you a raving lunatic? Ahmadinejad has publicly declared his desire to destroy Israel and see America run into the ground. Half of the country&#8217;s government is made up of fundamentalist, extremist Muslims who hate the west and everything that it stands for. Everyday, in many parts of the world, these kind of mislead, uneducated, unfortunate fools strap suicide bomb belts to their waists and run into crowds of people shouting God&#8217;s praises all the way, convinced that they are going straight to heaven after they blow themselves and everyone else to pieces. If there is even the slightest possibility that a person with this mindset could be in control of even ONE nuclear weapon, everything that can be done MUST be done to stop them from acquiring one. And if you think these kind of people do not live in Iran and even run parts of the government, you need a reality check buddy. Just open up the newspaper or search somewhere else on this website and you will see the evidence. It scares me enough that Pakistan has nukes, but IRAN? Peaceful huh? I bet there are quite a few soldiers in Iraq that were blown up by IEDs made from materials exported from Iran that might disagree with you. Come back down to Earth, I really do wish that we all could get along too, but even if America just completely disappeared from the middle east and left them alone, people with these kinds of ideologies would still want to kill everyone that disagreed with them. Wake up.</p>

                        <p>Fine let all the liberals and pro-choice abortion lovers have their Roe V. Wade.  Just change the law to state that if you want an abortion you have to perform it.  Don&#8217;t force some doctor or nurse whose are bound by law to perform it for you.  You want abortion you kill your own child.  I can&#8217;t believe how these abortion loving people are the same ones who won&#8217;t eat meat, eggs, and now want human breast milk used for ice cream because a cows milk should be used for just the calves!  They are also the same people that make the killing of a pregnant woman a double homocide.  You can&#8217;t have it both ways unless the mother does her own abortion, otherwise technically the doctor should be put on trial for murder.</p>

                        <p>The one thing that confuses me is this.  Nobody seems to have a full handle on when, exactly, life begins.  On both sides of the equation. So, if one is not sure when life begins &#8211; is it not better to err on the side of caution? </p>
<p>We go to great lengths to allow PETA and other animal rights groups get vulgar in order to advance a position. However, pro-life groups are positioned as religious nuts &#8211; because of pro-choice?  </p>

                        <p>Way back Dave wrote the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;What Biden said once was “I believe life begins at conception, however I don’t feel it is my duty to legislate my faith on others.”</p>
<p>Joe, Joe, Life beginning at conception is not a religious principle its a scientific fact. It is no more a religious belief than the law of gravity. As someone wisely put it, &#8220;Everyone who has purchased a condom knows when life begins.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would question the ethics of a man who claims to believe that life begins at conception yet consistently votes opposite to these beliefs. Do we want him a heartbeat from the top? Who could trust him?</p>
<p>Seems the good Archbishop has touched a nerve. Its a nerve that needs touching. Time for Catholics to wake up and realize they are being used, as Catholic immigrants have been used since their arrival in the US. Not that the Republican party is any better.</p>
<p>Its about time that the Catholic hierarchy sood up for its teaching.</p>

                        <p>&#8220;If your against abortion, you better be doubly against war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not correct.  Actually quite stupid comparison.  Abortion is about killing the UNARMED INNOCENT IN COLD BLOOD.</p>
<p>War can be about defending one&#8217;s nation and one&#8217;s family.  War against Hitler is justified.  ABORTION CAN NEVER BE JUSTIFIED BECAUSE IT IS THE TAKING OF AN UNARMED, INNOCENT LIFE IN COLD BLOOD.</p>
<p>Stop this silly &#8220;comparison&#8221; talk in this blog now and stay on topic which is about the democrat party becoming the party of death, as pronounced by a high ranking member of the Church of Life.  THAT IS THE TOPIC.  Stop this silly distraction.  Or are you too stupid to stay on topic?</p>

                        <p>Raymond Burke speaks falsely in this matter. If he were a man of God, he would be calling for donations to Catholic Relief for starving Haiti, but instead uses his position to steer US catholic sheep to conservative politics. </p>
<p>In 2004 an Ohio priest reflected on the election (Bush vs Kerry) and similarly urged his flock with this quote from his sermon: &#8220;Some catholics would dare to think for themselves and risk eternal damnation instead of following the teaching and education of the church.&#8221; So we&#8217;ve had 4 more years of an evil, stupid, lying administration-perfectly deserved by Moron America.</p>
<p>Political clergy have learned nothing since. It is not a matter of being left or right or politically central. Christians, Jews, Muslims (and i presume some Hindus and Buddhists) have deeply entwined their beliefs with political positions, overtly on principle, covertly for greed of power and influence.  Moneylenders at the steps of the Temple!</p>
<p>Religions cannot help humanity. The leaders are lost in building the tribe and dangling dreams of heaven.</p>
<p>This is the Age of Confoundment, where all the religion, education, and prosperity of humanity counts for nothing.</p>
<p>Every time you sheep think you&#8217;re cozy with God, I COMMAND you to think of the suffering of Haiti, which foretells humanity&#8217;s fate. You did nothing for them.</p>

                        <p>If the Catholic church wants a voice in US politics, then the US Catholic contingency can give up their tax exepmt status.</p>
<p>Not that I like Pelosi or Biden, they are right in saying they don&#8217;t want to impose their personal views on others.</p>
<p>I DO NOT like the idea of ignorant women using abortion as a birth control method (oops I&#8217;m pregnant again, Ill just get an abortion&#8230;again), but I believe that women should be able to make a decision to terminate a pregnancy in cases of heath issues, severe birth defects, rape and incest. </p>
<p>What we really need in this country is better sex education; not failed &#8220;abstinance only&#8221; programs. Teach kids about birth control methods AND the consquences of sex instead of acting like if you don&#8217;t tell kids about sex they won&#8217;t have sex.</p>
<p>Personally, I think all of the people who say all abortion should be banned and say all babies should be wanted and loved, should line up to adopt all the unwanted babies that come from unplanned and unwanted pregnancies&#8230; Put your money where your mouth is.</p>

                        <p>Abortion is the taking of innocent lives in cold blood.</p>
<p>War is the defense of one&#8217;s nation and one&#8217;s family.  Abortion and the taking of innocent life is NEVER justified; war such as against Hitler is easily justified.</p>
<p>A proper analogy of abortion is Hitler&#8217;s SS gunning down unarmed women and children in Poland or Ukraine or Italy.  That is analogous to abortion, so if one wants to comapre abortion to anything, that is what you compare it to.</p>

                        <p>This topic is about a head of the Church of Life saying the US Democrat party has lost its way and is rapidly becoming the party of death.  This is accurate, based on the party&#8217;s support for abortion, including partial birth abortion which is actually infanticide.  So let&#8217;s stick to the article as a discussion point.</p>
<p>Why do you disagree and think the Democrat party is NOT the party of death?</p>

                        <p>The pope may talk like hes serious but he leaves the teeth out of the bite&#8230;.he had his opportunity when Kerry and Pelosi took communion..he could have easily taken his position then by excommunicating them on the spot for supporting abortion, homosexuality, man/animal stem cell cloning, etc. He did not. he made a fatal error and this weakness is now exploited by the demons we have to contend with..and the church is now weak and feeble and toothless. Murderers should be punished by thier own murder for supporting murder. So I believe in an eye for an eye.</p>

The whole premise behind being pro-life is that the baby in the womb is a living human being and aborting, or taking the life of, that human is murder. What&#8217;s religious in that?</p>

                        <p>As a Christian, Protestant, I hate abortion and loath the doctors of death who make their fortunes off both scared, lost girls and greedy, uncaring women who can&#8217;t buy that nice car unless Doctor Vacuumababy does her a womb-cleaning.  These people who claim to be Catholic but also support abortion puzzle me, so its interesting to see one of their prelates actually take a stand.  I simply presumed they were, in the main, hypocrites.  As far as whether one&#8217;s faith should be discussed or disclosed as a matter of politics, I vote in the affirmative.  That is my opinion, as opposed to those with other opinions.  May I have my opinion? I want to know what politicians believe, to which faith they subscribe,and to what degree they share my own views.  Once again, that&#8217;s my opinion, the views of a simple Christian with no power and utterly void of political mojo.</p>

                        <p>It&#8217;s obvious to everyone that the Democrat party does not hold Christian values, this should be taught to the public so that Christians, especially Catholics, understand that they should hold their values when they vote. The Church, and all religious leaders, need to teach the public of their responsibility. The values of Christians are not in line with the Democrat party and the Church needs to raise her voice and make this known. As Christians we cannot continue to be apathetic and let puffed up speeches and nominal Catholics sway our vote.</p>

                        <p>I have to agree with the Vatican.  The Democrats support of Gay Rights, ABORTION, which is the murdering of life at its conception and other views conflict with Biblical teachings and is indeed harmful to our nation and our nation&#8217;s vested interest in development of life styles with morales, versus the Democrats who want to destroy decent morale behavior not just within the US, but in some cases, the world.  Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry and many of the Kennedy families have forsaken the teachings of the Lord, yet call themselves practicing Catholics.  A true Catholic does not violate the teachings of the Lord!</p>

                        <p>First of all, if you are not a woman who has carried a child in your womb, then you should not have a say. Period. You have NO idea what you are talking about. </p>
<p>Not once, in either of my two pregnancies, was I in control of the human inside me. NOT ONCE. Anyone who says it is a womans choice because it is HER body is ignorant of the truth. They (my children) were not me, nor part of my body, nor under my control. AND God knew them before he placed them in my womb. Just like he knew you and loved you.  You want a choice??? Choose a condom! Choose abstinence! Murdering a child because you are not responsible enough to have safe sex is pathetic, disgusting, and should NEVER have been made legal. </p>
<p>But honestly, that is neither here nor there. Abortion within the first trimester will never be illegal.  What is important is to look to the moral character of a man who whole-heartedly believes that it is ok to murder a child who is perfectly capable of survival outside of the womb. A man who would deny medical treatment to infants born alive. Children of God, left to die in a trash can. If you support this, then you are guilty of murder too. And may God have mercy on your soul.</p>
<p>As for war&#8230; I don&#8217;t believe we have re-instated the draft. NO ONE is risking their life for their country by force. They know the risk when they sign up for the armed forces, and they are proud to take that risk. I have several friends and family in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ask them who they are voting for in November. You will only find a handful of democrats over there. The numbers are staggering.  The only ones whining about war are the ones sitting over here on their asses hoping the goverment delivers their welfare check on time and that their foody card has enough on it for pizza tomorrow. If you&#8217;ve never carried a child, and would never risk your life for your country, then shut up and go to bed. Your opinion doesn&#8217;t count.</p>

                        <p>Though I am not a Catholic, I am impressed with the church&#8217;s bravery in speaking the truth.  Those comments here trying to muddy the waters about Iran and nuclear war are just missing the point and also hoping to divert attention from the moral bankruptcy of the Democrat party.  The facts are that the Democrats place no value on the most innocent lives among us; the unborn.  They hide behind euphemism to put a presentable face to the horrors of infanticide, calling it &#8216;choice&#8217;.</p>
<p>This is one Protestant that truly wishes God&#8217;s blessing on these men for speaking the truth.</p>

                        <p>The issue here is about abortion.  It&#8217;s time to stop looking at abortion as a philosophical discussion and start admitting what it is.  The church says life begins at conception because biologically that is when the existence of a human life does begin.  It is the clearest most scientific fact.  Egg and sperm merge and life begins.  If you don&#8217;t &#8220;believe&#8221; that it is like    saying you don&#8217;t believe 2+2=4, because that is not your belief.  Americans need to be educated about abortion.  Let&#8217;s start with visuals shall we.  Google &#8220;abortion&#8221; images if you can stomach it and have the courage to face the truth, the real inconvenient truth.  Like it or not, the democratic party supports this.</p>

                        <p>If you want to justify abortion other than the killing of an innocent human life then tell me when life begins.  Give me an answer that is irrefutable, that doesn&#8217;t change with time or technology.  The only answer is conception.  To deny that is simply a non-answer.  If you want to justify abortion as a convenience, that it&#8217;s simply not in the mother or fathers best selfish interest then be honest and say that.  It&#8217;s amazing to me that the Democratic party, the one that says its looking out for the little guy, leaves behind the most vulnerable of all.</p>

                        <p>The Catholic leader is correct.<br />
The Democrats have been taken over by mixed nuts and assorted fruits, religious fanatics who are Humanist-indocrinated whether they understand the source of their new, Christianity-replacing faith or not.<br />
Their founding scriptures, the Humanist Manifestos (http://www.jcn.com/manifestos.html)dema nd death for old people and the &#8216;right&#8217; of &#8216;choice&#8217; to kill innocent unborn children.<br />
Their First Commandment is that there is no God, and their sacrament, the body and blood of living human children, practiced 1.5 million times per year in abortuaries. Very humane and &#8216;enlightened,&#8217; eh?<br />
Whether it&#8217;s &#8216;Choice, Diversity, World Community, Equitable Redistribution Of Wealth And Resources, Consenting Adults,&#8217; etc., all the Democrats ideas and beliefs come from the Humanist belief system, not Christianity.<br />
Of COURSE they hate Catholics (I&#8217;m a Protestant, but I like Catholics and their Biblical stance on Life), and of COURSE they believe their own religion and it&#8217;s liberal mantras are the superior ones.<br />
But they ARE just as religious as the Catholics!</p>

<p>You that have such scorn for those that are not perfect enough for you &#8211; and choose life &#8211; must not really cherish life at least as much as I do.</p>
<p>People aren&#8217;t perfect, and when nations seek to destroy others, the resistance to that is war. That is not an abortion issue. Get your proportions in order, or quit grasping for straws.</p>

                        <p>43,000,000 babies killed all thanks to Democrats and  Roe V Wade. Who, BTW, has since admitted she lied, and is pro-life now. And even with the invention of the ultra sound, and all that it shows, including a nearly fully developed baby at 11 weeks, the Democrats STILL obssess about aborting live babies, then support selling their body parts to ghouls who would research them. LETS BE HONEST! It is not about CHOICE, or a womans reproductive rights. That&#8217;s nonsense. A woman if free to take the pill, wear the patch, or have an IUD. It&#8217;s about the money that the research brings the Universities aka DNC Madrasses. I would like to see Nancy Pelosi take communion. Does she even go to church?</p>

<p>WORLDWIDE</p>
<p>Number of abortions per year: Approximately 42 Million<br />
Number of abortions per day: Approximately 115,000</p>
<p>WORLD WAR II</p>
<p>The total estimated human loss of life caused by World War II was roughly 72 million people.</p>
<p>In less than two years, the number of human lifes extinquished is greater than all the people killed in WWII.  This is a horrible fact and by the way, thank your parents for not having an abortion or you wouldn&#8217;t be reading this.</p>

                        <p>People seems to shrink from moral absolutes as if moral absolutes were toxic. There can be no moral absolute if there is not a final arbiter of right and wrong. It is amazing to me how so many people have such poor biblical scholarship. They think they know what the bible says, they view Christ as a kind of Ghandi figure. Essentially they dictate what the bible says, they do not allow it to speak for itself, if you will. No where does the bible in either old or new testament prohibit killing. What is prohibited is &#8220;murder&#8221;-the illegal taking of life. There is a hebrew and aramaic work for &#8220;kill&#8221; and there is also a word for murder( illegal taking of life). Throughout scripture the state is not prohibited from defending itself(to the comment of warriors aiming rifles and &#8220;killing people) nor from authorities use of lethal force to defend its citizens. What is however consistently prohibited is the taking of innocent life, life that is unable to defend itself. Words have meaning and killing and murder are quite simply not the same-all murder is killing, BUT not all killing is murder.</p>

                        <p>I believe it was January 1972 that the Democratic majority Supreme Court ruled that a woman could have her child in her womb killed in the most horrible and cruel manner possible. Then,6 months later this same Court(?) ruled that an ax murderer/s could not be put to death in the most humane manner,because they considered murderers above punishment of death that these same people authorized for innocent babies. While there&#8217;s always a possibility of my eternity in hell,at least I will have reason to celebrate,because,surely these people will be there,regardless if they do,or donot believe in its existence.</p>

you wrote:<br />
&#8220;If it were up to these guys we would still follow scientific models where the sun circles the Earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Try learning a little history. The concept directly challenged the widely accepted model of the world that was held at the time. The Pope, and many others in the church knew that the solar model was very likely but there were political reasons that put them in a difficult position at the time. That is to say, the old idea that there is &#8220;the truth and then there is God&#8217;s truth&#8221; meant that political upheavals could follow sudden redefinitions of the static model of life and God&#8217;s plan as explained by the church. For all its faults, the confrontations with apostasy and the extremely close relationship between the church and political centers of power, the church has been a powerful force for scientific development. For instance, the kindly monk portrayed as observing the differences in pea seeds and learning about the segregation of &#8220;traits&#8221; (genes) was actually a scholar trained in chemistry, physics and biology and was assigned to undertake studies on animal and plant improvements by the Vatican. His seminal work (little joke or two there) was largely ignored because he explained it in mathematical terms (quadratic equations, etc.) and a lot of people at the time just didn&#8217;t get it. But anyway, your accusations about the Church as a force of ignorance only demonstrate you traffic in the cheap, sleeazy &#8220;recieved&#8221; wisdom of tin-pot bigots, in just the same way as the ass-end bigots who sieze on religious dogma try to explain everything in those terms.<br />
BTW: I&#8217;m an agnostic, not a religious person as you might impune, simply because rigidly doctrinare people think. I like to know what I am talking about, rather than blathering  abusive slogans and insolent rubbish.</p>

                        <p>Jordan: try early 1500s on the Reformation, it&#8217;s a little more accurate than 1100.  You&#8217;re thinking of the Orthodox schism.  </p>
<p>The Babylonian Captivity was about 600 BC, and involved the Hebrews.  </p>
<p>I believe the Archbishop has spoken truly, and is not out of line.  I would like, in the interests of balance, for him to, at some point, address Republican apathy in doing anything to stop wrongful bioethical practices other than give lip service to it.  I think it makes them a &#8220;party of death,&#8221; too.</p>

<p>Morals are a very slippery slope for the left when you consider Obama and his votes for infanticide.  Even partial birth abortion isn&#8217;t enough to satiate the liberal blood lust.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed a few comments which resort to moral relativism with Republicans. That&#8217;s part of the problem, too.</p>
<p>Democrats are responsible for their own actions. God does not judge us in the light of what an opposing political party did or did not do, He judges us in the context of our own actions and inactions. When your day has come and you&#8217;re ready to enter eternity, will you tell God &#8220;but the Republicans are just as bad!&#8221;</p>
<p>I think not.</p>

                        <p>Apparently Democtrat Catholics only have to support certain parts of the Bible. Any thing else would be above their pay grade.  There is a reason Wall Street&#8217;s approval rating is one point higher than the Democrat controlled Congress.

                        <p>Just to the make a Biblical distinction for unbelievers.  The commandment &#8220;Thou shalt not kill&#8221; is given to individuals&#8211;not governments.  War is an altogether different matter than the premeditated murder of the innocent unborn.  The democratic party is the party of pro-choice in this country.  And I might add that given how the pro-choice folks have mocked Governor Palin on this, it seems that &#8220;choosing&#8221; life doesn&#8217;t count!</p>

                        <p>The letter Archbishop Burke refers to was from then Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict, to the US Council of Catholic Bishops. The letter instructed the US bishops to deny Communion to Catholic politicians that supported abortion publicly. The letter was intercepted by the now retired cardinal of Washington and intentionally hidden from the council of bishops. Later when this Cardinal submitted his 75th birthday resignation to the new Pope Benedict, it was accepted promptly.<br />
   Archbishop Burke has been the greatest defender of the faith here and in Rome. Benedict&#8217;s recent Papal appointment to Prefect of the Apostoic Signatura (the highest ranking figure in church law) makes him a very prominent figure in the Vatican and some say a name to be reckoned with for the next Pope. He is sure to stress his points on Catholic teaching further here when it comes to abortion and Catholics that support it. No doubt about it. God Bless him. American catholics have been mislead by Washington politicians that keep promoting themselves as &#8220;Catholics&#8221; to get votes but promote baby killing at the same time. Archbishop Burke, I believe has had enough of that.</p>

Think about this when you go to the polls, people. How will God judge us as a Nation, on what we have accepted into our hearts, and what we have ommitted by CHOICE&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be informed that taking the life of an INNOCENT human being directly from the womb is far different than wars, the death penalty, nukes, etc.&#8221; by Tommy</p>
<p>NO IT ISN&#8217;T!! According to the Mageserium and the teachings of the Catholic Church, including the views expressed by Pope Joh  Paul II in St. Louis in 1999, the view of the Catholic Church is that all heman life is equal, and that executing a person is as grave a sin as abortion. He said that &#8220;All executions are cruel and unusual punishment in all cases and without exception&#8221;. He also said that any taking of human life except for direct self protection or under St. Augustine&#8217;s direction of a &#8220;just war&#8221; is sin. And the church in 2003, 2005, and 2006 issued statements that the war in Iraq &#8220;clearly, and in no case&#8221; falls under either or these directions. Please get your facts straight before you try to argue.</p>

                        <p>okay, Let&#8217;s take this one by one.<br />
1. If we go by how we feel or man&#8217;s standards of correct or prudent conduct, that conduct or standard is changeable, because the human heart is wicked above all things. It seeks it&#8217;s own level. Right and Wrong as decided by cultural mores have caused the most damage. The khmer rouge, hitler and his eugenics movement(lead by american eugenisists such as Margeret sanger, rabid bigot and founder of planned parenthood, as a means of eliminating blacks and so called undesirables) If there is no objective truth, we end up with humanities subjective truth. We see how that works out. Murder by numbers.</p>
<p>Often misquoted by the misguided, thou shalt not kill&#8230;.well no, that is not what it says&#8230;it says, thou shalt not do murder. If God did not believe in war for a righteous cause, he never would have told the Isrealites to take the land from it&#8217;s inhabitants, nor would he have made David King of Isreal after slaying Goliath. Abortion is murder, because it is the taking of innocent life. The death penalty is allowed in Genesis.  If any man sheds the blood of another man (plainly meaning cold blooded murder when read within context) then by man shall his blood be shed. Murderers are not innocent. They have taken it into their own hands to sow destruction, and in doing so, have sowed the seeds of their own destruction.</p>
<p>And before someone attempts the red herring of old testament laws in leviticus, the new testament put ceremonial law to rest with the crucifiction of Christ, his blood the recompense for our sins,has made us whole through grace by faith, not works. Paul stated in romans (not a direct quote here&#8230;&#8217;one man esteems one day above another, one man will only eat vegetables, let each do his own will&#8217;. Does that mean we continue to sin? By no means. As Christ said, it is not what we eat that defiles us, it&#8217;s what resides in the heart. For we are freed from sin by the indwelling spirit of Christ, when we accept his redemptive offering we are freed from the law, but not from seeking to become closer to Christ or more christlike. His attributes are found in his words, not the least of which is the sermon on the mount, BUT dont forget, he also drove the money changers out of the temple with a WHIP in a righteous rage, he was no soft pacifist, when it counted, when truth counted, Jesus fought. Therefore we put off our old selves and pick up the cross of Christ and seek to be his representatives in this world.  </p>
<p>Last but certainly not least&#8230;Just because we are imperfect and sinful does not mean we cannot speak out about the evil of abortion. Speaking about one evil does not prohibit speaking about poverty, Nor does it negate the argument that abortion is the taking of a human life. All the human sin in the world does not negate the evil of abortion, one sin no matter how grotesque, does not negate another lesser sin, nor does the lesser sin dim the more henious one. One evil (the pedophilia of a few priests) does not mean that another priest who has not been implicated in such things can not speak about sin. Just because people sometimes do not live up to ideals and standards DOES NOT MEAN THERE SHOULD BE NO STANDARDS. Without standards, we are mere animals without dignity or humanity. Anything becomes acceptable in the name of tolerance, (which is really just lazy apathy) and even morally equal. When that happens, the collapse of civilization cannot be far behind.<br />

                        <p>As an American Republican, I must admit mixed feelings about the Democrat embrace of Extinction Life Style. The famous article, The Empty Cradle Will Rock published by the WSJ a few years ago, pointed out that there are now about six million missing Democrats at the polls. This is one reason Democrats lose elections despite many advantages such as having the establishment media in their hip pocket.</p>
<p>I think we already have a workable compromise. We Republicans should continue loving and cherishing children and Democrats should continue terminating theirs. Over time this will also improve the American gene pool.</p>

                        <p>I&#8217;m very concerned, as a Catholic, that the church has defined life strictly in terms of abortion.  In America, the church has become solely defined as the anti-abortion church.  We are more than that</p>
<p>The United States is engaged in an unjust war, the country condones the death penalty, we have ignored the least amongst us on a daily basis.  Yet as a church, we do not care.  Our sole interest is in abortion and telling people who disagree with us they have no place in our church.  We do not care if they agree  -that abortion is morally wrong.  Instead we expect that they agree totally on how we end the problem of abortion.  Do you really think outlawing abortion will end abortion?  No it will not.  It will only close the door to confused people.  It will tell Catholic women that the church door is not open to them for advice and forgiveness.</p>

                        <p>Dave and like-minded people say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people believe life begins the very moment of conception, some like myself feel that true life doesn’t begin until you are born into the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Dave would agree that there is a chance that life begins at conception.  Wouldn&#8217;t you rather err on the side that it does indeed begin at conception rather than risk killing a human being?</p>
<p>We are not like the hoofed creatures of the Serengeti.  We still cannot take care of ourselves the moment we leave the womb.  If you really want to side with someone who shares your view and feels even newborns don&#8217;t deserve to live, then you need to cast a vote for Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Stop taking the &#8220;I feel this way and other people feel another way&#8221; stance &#8211; and choose.  Is it a human being or not? Give valid reasons why or why not &#8211; that ultimately is the question that everyone drawn to this blog needs to answer.</p>

                        <p>45,000,000 Americans have been murdered since Roe vs Wade.  The Democrats, more than any other party, have made it their mission to keep abortions happening.  NARAL and Planned Parenthood kickback millions to the Democratic Party.  Just like the Nazis who pulled the gold teeth out of their victims mouths, the Democrat party profits from the murder of the innocent unborn. If these Americans had not been murdered, maybe we wouldn&#8217;t need to bring in 20 million Mexicans to fill US jobs.  Maybe they would have been hard working taxpayers that could have contributed to the solvency of Social Security for future retirees.  If just 10% of them were geniuses, then abortionists have murdered 4,500,000 Americans that could possibly have found solutions to the critical problems faced by our nation and the world.  Those who defend abortion rights are evil.</p>

                        <p>The wages you earn for sin is death (Romans 6:23) Sin is breaking any one of Yahweh&#8217;s 613 Laws found in the first five books of your Bible called The Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.(1 John 3:4)  If you read Revelation Chapter 17 you&#8217;ll read of a &#8220;whore&#8221; who sits on 7 hills who is teaching the world to commit fornication and abominations.  Check any reliable encyclopedia and you&#8217;ll find that ROME is the city of seven hills.  This is where the Pope resides, in the Vatican which sits on one of those hills.  He has taught this world to worship a GOD named Jesus (also known as ZEUS THE GREEK SKY GOD)who is nothing more than a false savior who is powerless to do anything for anyone.Yahshua Messiah is the true Savior sent by Yahweh to bless us by turning us away from all of our iniquites.(Acts 3:26) Iniquity is &#8220;doing away with&#8221; Yahweh&#8217;s Laws as you can read for yourself in Strongs Concordance.  This is what the Pope of Rome (the Holy Roman Empire) has accomplished.  They have taught all of us in the inhabited world to commit fornication and partake of all abominations, i.e., eating pork and rodents, like the Capybara the Pope approved the South Americans to eat during Lent declaring this rodent a &#8220;fish&#8221; to justify this abominable practice.  Read Isaiah 65 and 66 and see what Yahweh thinks of eating unclean creatures.  Recently this deceiver on the seven hills of Rome mandated that Yahweh&#8217;s Name be taken out of all catholic literature and songs and must not be used during mass as it is &#8220;too holy to pronounce&#8221;. Google this for yourself and you&#8217;ll see its true. Notice it is Yahweh whom he is against, not GOD or Jesus or Jehovah or Buddah or Allah or any GOD of this world&#8230;only the Heavenly Father Yahweh Whom is not a God nor ever claimed to be.  In fact He told us not to be worshipping (serving) Gods!<br />
The reason the Pope does not Yahweh&#8217;s Name in the literature is you might get wise to who ther Creator truly is and you might start calling on Him (Yahweh) and be delivered from the destruction, diseases and nuclear war that is soon to come. (Joel 2:32) The whole world is deceived. Revelation 12:9 The Pope&#8217;s time to deceive the world is alost over. COME OUT OF HER (THE CATHOLIC CHURCH) MY PEOPLE SO YOU DO NOT PARTAKE OF HER SINS AND SO YOU DO NOT RECEIVE OF HER PLAGUES. Rev. 18:4  Go TO YAHWEH.COM AND BE ENLIGHTENED.</p>

<p>John Paul may well have said that, but he was NOT speaking &#8216;ex Cathedra&#8217;. No pope has ever asserted that opposition to capital punishment is binding on the faithful. In fact, the Catechism actually specifies the conditions under which capital punishment is allowable. All American states adhere to that or more rigid standard. </p>

                 <div class="commentsBody">
                        <p>Let us look at two similar human rights situations:</p>
<p>1854 Dred Scott decision: some human beings, because of the color of their skin, are labled &#8220;chattel&#8221; and not recognized as human persons. This dehumanizing of the African American person was fundamentally immoral and yet upheld by law in mamy States. Dred Scott, who had sued for his freedom, was given the decision that, not only did he have no right to sue for his freedom, he had no right to be a free individual, the Supreme Court having usurped a God-given right (as defined in the Declaration of Independence -&#8220;endowed by the Creator&#8221;)<br />
A civil war came to be fought over States&#8217; rights and whether or not this great nation should divide over the slavery issue or not, if slavery should be abolished or not.<br />
President Abraham Lincoln, midwestern, self-educated (not Harvard educated) lawyer chooses war (as a last resort) to defend the Union and the humanity of enslaved blacks.<br />
Outcome: the Union was preserved and blacks were declared emancipated &#8211; free persons and granted citizenship with all its rights (even if it took time for this to be fully accepted in some places).<br />
Lincoln was a Republican. Democrats favored slavery or were, at least, &#8220;pro-choice&#8221;, to let Southern landowners decide whether or not to own slaves (perhaps out of respect to the &#8220;right to privacy&#8221;?). The South voted solidly Democratic until the late 1970&#8217;s. Many opted out of the party of their parents and grandparents because it no longer reflected their values, as per the 2nd case.</p>
<p>1973 Roe v Wade: some human beings, because of their age and vulnerability, are labled with words like &#8220;products of conception&#8221;, &#8220;blob of tissue&#8221;. The result left those not yet born, but on the way, to no protection by the US government. Any reason could be given to abort under the &#8220;life of the &#8216;mother\'&#8221; clause, even up to the day of birth. This dehumanizing of human beings who happened to be one day old or one month old or five weeks or six months led to the desensitization of our people and those who worked for this decision have also seen fit to ensconce it in the psyche the nation by ensuring its indoctrination in our children in school, our youth in universities (those born the year of the decision are at least 35 years old). It has opened the door for the hubris of the scientific community to manipulate very young human beings for the sake of &#8220;research&#8221;, to strip them of their stem cells, for example, even though all credible studies have shown that adult stem cells have actually cured diseases and embyonic stem cells not only have never cured any diseases, they have caused cancer in many cases when tried. Those who want to keep the unborn child, whether embryo, fetus or zygote, in its current state of &#8220;slave&#8221; to the will of the adults who called it into being and/or wish to manipulate or destroy it at will include NARAL, Planned Parenthood Federation, and, since the last 35 years or so, the Democratic Party. Infiltrated by disgruntled leftists who could not make it on their own (socialists, communists), they have succeeded in highjacking the party and refashioning it according to leftist ideologies in the name of a self-defined &#8220;progress&#8221;. The result has been a regress of our people. Since Roe v Wade, &#8220;Roe&#8221; (Norma McCorvey) has since become staunchly pro life; so also have women who have had abortions who are &#8220;Silent No More&#8221; and abortion doctors, such as Dr. Bernard Nathanson, one of the founding members of NARAL who once operated the largest abortion clinic in NYC.<br />
The experimentation on very young humans resembles the horrible experiments carried on by the Nazi scientists on human beings, including children, during WWII.<br />
Just as slavery did not make us a better nation, so, too, abortion on demand has not made us a better nation.<br />
Women are more easily preyed upon by men who exploit them and then refuse to help them or, worse, encourage them to abort. Economics has become an excuse (just as it was for the slavery of the 19th century). As Nobel prize winner Mother Teresa of Calcutta once observed when questioned by an American journalist her views on abortion: &#8220;America is such a poor country. In India, we are poor, but we feed our children. But in America you are so poor you have to kill them.&#8221; Again, she brought up the &#8220;A&#8221; word at a White House Prayer Breakfast during the Clinton administration: &#8220;Abortion is the greatest challenge to peace in our times. If a nation permits the child in the womb to be killed, what is to stop me or anyone from killing any other person?&#8221; Abortion has forced health care workers, called to heal and &#8220;do no harm&#8221;, to become workers in the &#8220;killing fields&#8221; of the abortion industry. And, make no mistake about it, it is a multi-million dollar industry. Were that not so, groups like Planned Parenthood would not be so tenacious about maintaining it.<br />
I have faith that Roe v Wade will be overturned. As more and more people are coming to discover the truth about the life of the unborn -new ultra sounds have also helped to bring this reality home to many people- more and more are finding the whole abortion thing so very distasteful and immoral, and the Roe v Wade decision for the sham that it was/is. It is the Republican party, the party of Lincoln which freed the slaves, which has stood more consistently on the side of the unborn child -and the elderly, the sick, the average traditional family, working people and so on. The Democrats have so removed themselves from these groups; the few pro-life Democrats have been silenced, if not exploited. They may have to do what Ronald Reagan, once a Democrat did -leave the party since, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t they who left the party, it&#8217;s the party which left them&#8221;. It is no longer the party of FDR and JFK, both of whom would be appalled by what it has morphed into.<br />
Moreover, the media has, by and large, taken sides -the side of the neo-liberal Democrats (neo-liberal because they are not liberal in the classic sense of being open to the viewpoints of others). It was enough to see the way Charles Gibson and Katie Couric condescendingly interviewed Governor Palin.<br />
I believe in the common sense of most of our citizens who have been seeing through the web of lies spun by the media, spun by the Democrats, spun by the Obama camp, and they will rise to the occasion and make the right choice on November 4. When they do, we will begin to see, at long last, the emancipation of the unborn child and the end of the exploitation of unborn children.</p>

                        <p>It&#8217;s way past time that the Catholic Church puts its money where its mouth is and stand up for the unborn. Abortion is a barbaric procedure any way you look at it and if the Catholic Church doesn&#8217;t defend these innocent babies who will? There is no wiggle room when it comes to defending the unborn and these so-called &#8220;catholic&#8221; politicians must be held to account for their evil stand on abortion by the leaders of the Catholic Church. Like I said it&#8217;s way past time for the clergy to put these politicians in their place.</p>

                        <p>OK&#8230; First, for all you talking about separation of church and state&#8230; there is no state sponsorship of the catholic church whatsoever, so this point is not relevant. </p>
<p>Second, for those of you who know this but understand the 501(c)3 status of churches and the requirement that 501(c)3&#8217;s not endorse any particular candidate or party, there is are reasons there is no problem here.</p>
<p>1. First and foremost, this is not an endorsement, its a criticism of a political policy of a particular party and most specifically of politicians who are uneducated in certain aspects of their moral philosophy and the faith which they claim to represent. Non-profits do not lose their right to support or criticize POLICIES of any particular party or politician. (Lets not forget the Pope&#8217;s vocal opposition to the Bush doctrine of pre-emption and the war in Iraq, not to mention the death penalty during his visit to the US.)</p>
<p>2. The comment comes from the Vatican i.e. a sovereign nation according to international law. </p>
<p>3. Now, those of you who talk about &#8220;The Catholic Church&#8221; having tax exempt status, I invite you to pause and reflect and think about if you really honestly think the Vatican in Rome files a U.S. Tax Return&#8230; I hope you&#8217;ve quickly concluded that&#8217;s ridiculous. </p>
<p>The Church, like all other international non-profit organizations is incorporated in each place separately from the Vatican. Dioceses are each incorporated as their own entity in the U.S. and in some states parishes are only partially incorporated into the diocese sort of like franchises. Each individual parish could in theory break with the diocese or dioceses could break with Rome, although it would require a rogue Bishop because of the way the articles of incorporation are written. Each diocese or parish files its own tax exempt forms with the IRS (and state if necessary). </p>
<p>SO, if one parish priest in Wyoming endorses a candidate or party he endangers his parish&#8217;s tax exempt status for that year, but not the entire Catholic Church throughout the nation&#8230; which I think all would agree is reasonable. Now with regard to the pedophilia cases, federal courts have decided to &#8220;pierce the corporate veil&#8221; in those cases due to managerial negligence. That is to say that while a parish may be incorporated separately from the diocese the separation between the diocese and the parish level is non-existent when the Bishop is the one moving people around. But that rule would not apply unless it could be proven that the diocese knew what was going on at the parish level. </p>
<p>Thus, even IF the archbishop was representing his diocese when making those comments, any tax exempt status could theoretically only be stripped from his diocese (of course assuming he was breeching the 501(c)3 stipulations &#8211; which he was not). Tax exempt status cannot be stripped from &#8220;The Catholic Church&#8221; because according to the law there is no such think as the universal catholic church as we imagine it in our heads, only dioceses incorporated in each state.</p>
<p>3. Now on a Constitutional note, truly the last thing the federal government (the President, Congress, and Supreme Court) want is a Supreme Court case between The Catholic Archdiocese of (x) and The United States of America. Talk about political suicide and culture wars. Not to mention there is no established constitutional authority for the 501(c)3 restriction on churches. The first amendment says, &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or respecting the free exercise thereof.&#8221; The supreme court has primarily held two different standards, one being that government could support religious organizations so long as it did not discriminate between them, and then there is the more recent &#8220;wall of separation&#8221; doctrine. The problem for those who are against religion in the public square is that they would like to apply the &#8220;wall of separation&#8221; when it comes to government GIVING money to religious affiliated institutions however they often have no problem with taxing the churches. This view is blatantly, although often not intentionally, hypocritical. If one believes in a strict wall of separation then the wall must apply both ways. However, if you follow the school that says government can fund religiously affiliated institutions under certain circumstances then you must leave open the possibility that funding or other privileges may be withheld based on certain conditions. </p>
<p>You can&#8217;t have it both ways, and so it is not entirely certain that the the &#8220;secularists&#8221; would win this Constitutional battle. In the end the Supreme Court could enshrine a church&#8217;s right to not be taxed as part of the free exercise clause and then speech be protected under freedom of speech and priests and bishops could endorse parties and candidates outright and without penalty from the government. Instead I think we should be content to not have the culture wars explode on the federal level and remain content with the current comfortable, although vague, truce between the churches and state.</p>
<p>The churches that really benefit most from this arrangement are the baptists and evangelicals. The catholic and mainline protestant churches are organized into hierarchical structures (dioceses) and largely based in major population centers with parishioners encompassing a wide range of the political spectrum. They therefore are more easily exposed and make easy targets for a theoretical lawsuit. Therefore, they are careful not to breach the 501(c)3 restrictions. Evangelical churches however use a truly American strategy to gain their political sway and that is celebrity status of a select few evangelical pastors. Because they do not actually speak for an organized church at all they are impossible to penalize for endorsing one candidate or the other. Even if pastors in the large rural congregations did breech the 501(c)3 status, the government would not only have to prove it, but also have to try each individual 100 seat church separately in court rather than entire dioceses. As you can see the law favors the political power of churches that are decentralized, rual, and often radical &#8211; so long as they don&#8217;t put anything in writing. So when pundits talk about the powerful Evangelical conservative vote and the near irrelevance of the Catholic vote, remember what you read here, and what you know of American history, 501c3 status is just another tool of southern white protestants to maintain their control of the country.</p>

                        <p>With regards to abortion and the Democratic party&#8217;s stance:</p>
<p>There appears to be a very strong motive for their wanting to &#8220;protect&#8221; a woman&#8217;s right to choose &#8230; selfishness.</p>
<p>1) A woman wants to have sex and does so, without concern in becoming pregnant.<br />
2) The woman decides she doesn&#8217;t want the child growing within her.<br />
3) The woman has an abortion.</p>
<p>For some reason, the Democratic party doesn&#8217;t want us procreating. Their rationale is very clear as they want it to otherwise look like they&#8217;re &#8220;protecting&#8221; a woman&#8217;s right to choose, while the entire time they&#8217;re encouraging them to NOT reproduce.</p>
<p>Interesting thought, is it not?</p>
<p>I just wish people would hold the sanctity for life and the sacred act of procreating in higher regard. We need to return to being a more responsible society.</p>

                        <p>I&#8217;m not a Catholic, but I totally agree with the church official. Plain and simple, the Democrats are a &#8220;party of death.&#8221; It was the logical step for them to get the most liberal senator to run for president, and one who has voted against the unborn time after time. NARAL, NOW, and all the liberal feminist groups support Obama.<br />
And no wonder, their sacred cow, &#8220;convenience killing,&#8221; is at stake in this race.</p>
<p>Are you proud dems? To be linked to the holocaust of our times in the name of convenience and &#8220;equal rights&#8221; for women? What a joke. You have the blood of millions of innocents on your hands. The unborn are the most vulnerable of Americans. No one can hear their cries of anguish as they&#8217;re sucked, scraped, skulls crushed, or they&#8217;re torn apart in the womb. I&#8217;ve held three kids and nine grandkids as newborns, and I can&#8217;t imagine anyone of them to have someone party to having their innocent little lives snuffed out. I know the hard cases. Almost 98% of abortions are for convenience, and not a health, incest, or rape issue. Democrats=the party of death.</p>

The majority of Republicans were for abortion, even Ronald Reagan who appointed Judge Scalia, who is Catholic and said on 60 minutes show that he would not make abortion illegal and that he didnt believe a fetus was covered by the constitution. How come he is not denied communion? I dont believe democrats should be called the party of death. But the hypocritical Republicans. Out of their mouths they say they are against abortion. But didnt change laws when they could have with Bush, who didnt keep his promises.This is the example of wolves in sheep clothing.</p>

                        <p>Micheal, your argument is so ridiculous you should never be allowed to post on the internet ever again. No U.S. politician has ever threatened to use nuclear weapons anywhere in the Middle East. The U.N. is actually trying to stop the Middle East from getting nuclear weapons so they don&#8217;t blow Israel off the map. Or do you actually think Iran wouldn&#8217;t love to do just that. If so you truly are ignorant and should be banned from the internet and all intellectual venues.</p>

                        <p>The responses her are stunning.  Like the one who argues that we need to keep killing innocent babies until we end all wars, because only then will we realise the sanctity of life.  Can you truly be foolish enough to believe your own twisted logic?  </p>
<p>And those who argue that Biden is right to argue for abortion, because while his beliefs which states that life begins at conception should not imposed on others.  Basic science states that life begins at conception.  Look at the definition of &#8220;Life&#8221;.  You may want to argue wether it in intelligent life, but to argue it is not life shows a lack of understanding of basic biology.</p>
<p>So if Biden believes that life begins at conception he has no more moral standing justifying abortion than he would attempting to justtify murder of full grownn adults.  What next argue that we should let infants die post birth if the mother decides she does not want the baby.  Only Obama could support such a sick resolution (BAIPA).</p>

                        <p>Bush met with the Pope in the medieval tower a few months ago&#8230; As you all probably know, the pope was a Hitler Nazi youth during WWII. It is the republicans that started a oil/pipeline war on behalf of Israel in the middle east and Afganistan&#8230; and the democrats are the party of death?</p>
<p>I know, I know, the conservatives flip reality so that their idiot class supporters will believe it, but then these poor suckers will believe anything.</p>
<p>Who cares what the vatican thinks? I think billions of dollars payed out to settle child molestation claims is what they need to focus on and the current pope was the person responsible for shipping those priests elsewhere and covering these crimes up.</p>

                        <p>Typical. Secular Americans have a problem with the Catholic Church, therefore the Church MUST be wrong (and we wonder why the rest of the world believes we are ignorant). Simply put, the Roman Catholic Church is NOT a pluralist Democratic institution. It is patriarchal with a singular authority figure at the top (which is not you). At no point does the Catholic Church require or even need your input. Would you insist upon using your hands in a soccer game because you dont like the rule &#8220;feet only&#8221;? NO ONE has the right to be Catholic. If you disagree with the Orthodoxy, go somewhere else. The expectation that one can be a pro-abortion Democrat (or Republican) and then insist they are Catholic speaks to the immaturity of that individual (not to mention the almost manic selfishness) and NOT the Roman Catholic Church. Nothing more.</p>

                        <p>The only reason for abortion is to rob American of its nationality. Once the legal and illegals fill the labor force and political posts then the borders will disappear and we will become the great North American Union nanny state with our own Euro and sing kumbya to our glorious leader, Obama.</p>

                        <p>If the question of when life begins is so open to interpretation, then can we extend the pre-life period to, say, up to two years old?  That would give us plenty of time to really decide if we want to keep this thing that we haven&#8217;t labeled a child yet.  This &#8220;in the womb, out of the womb&#8221; distinction just doesn&#8217;t fly.  I mean one second it&#8217;s a &#8220;fetus&#8221;, and the next moment, with a push or the slice of a scalpel, and ta da, we have life?  Head still in the birth canal?  Just a fetus.  Full delivery?  Hmm, well, if you can&#8217;t put the head back in (to perform the abortion) then we have to call it a life.  Kids aren&#8217;t really human anyway until after the terrible twos.  So would any pro-choice proponents disagree with my choice to have a post birth abortion, so long as I do it before this post born fetus turns 2?</p>

                        <p>Any Catholic who participates in, is a party to or is an enabler of abortion stands excommunicated from the Church and will spend eternity as a damed soul in the hands of Satan for all eternity in incomprehensible torment.  They have exercised their free will to choose death over everlasting life.  Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry, Ted Kennedy, Thurgood Marshall and all the others who are soaked in the blood of millions of the innocents are pathetic damned souls whose departure from this life will take them straight into hell and a torment that they have lied to themselves and lied to the weak fools who kill babies.  God himself said that it would be better that a millstone were hung about your neck and you were cast into the sea rather than to face his judgement with the blood of children on your hands.  So, Joe, Nancy, John, Ted, Thurgood and the rest&#8230;  good luck with that!</p>

                        <p>If the Vatican is using derogatory name calling and thinks the Democratic party is the &#8220;Party of death&#8221;, then I suppose one could respond by saying the Vatican is, &#8220;The home of child molesters.&#8221; The Vatican needs to stay out of politics and clean up it&#8217;s own house. Btw, I used to be a Catholic. I am now 100% atheist. I add that in case some religious whacko, and this country has more than it&#8217;s share, responds with, &#8220;You must be a Jew or a muslim.&#8221; It never ceases to amaze me, in this age, that people still think there is a god or believe in that comic book without pictures called the bible.

                        <p>I appreciate the Catholic Church standing up for the poor and helpless of this world. Good for you. I am not a catholic and when my youngest daughter was entering the 4th grade of the local public school and I saw the propaganda written on the blackboard by the home classroom teacher, I took her out of the pathetic public school and put her in a great catholic grade school in Portland Oregon &#8211; St. Claire&#8217;s and later into Valley Catholic High School where she received a fabulous education.

                        <p>Individual Catholics may stray from the fold on certain issues. But when they publicly misrepresent Church teachings, they bring scandal and shame on the Holy Catholic Church. If Pelosi is such a good Catholic, she could really use some time in &#8220;the box.&#8221; In 2000 years, the Catholic Church has never excommunicated anyone. Although many people excommunicate themselves by their actions, they are always welcome home by a forgiving God.</p>
<p>There can be just wars (and I&#8217;m not saying Iraq is or isn&#8217;t one of them) but there are no just abortions. Ever.</p>

                        <p>Reading all these comments, I&#8217;m thinking about the cartoon with the sign &#8220;Morons on Parade&#8221;. Are you over 8 years old? Did you gradz8 3rd grade?  Maybe you&#8217;ll remember that the statement &#8220;separation of Church and State&#8221; is NOWHERE in any of our laws. It was discussed in the Federalist Papers when the founding fathers were debating whether to include it in the Constitution (which they never did), which led to the first 10 Amendments (called the Bill of Rights), and the First Amendment guaranteed the Freedom of Religion. Remember any of that?  The reason for how this happened in our country goes back to jolly old England, where Henry VIII committed mass murder to declare himself Head of the Church so he could screw around without any criticism. So he invented a warped version of Christianity that suited his own sex life, and then he forced it on the people at the point of the sword. Years later, if you wanted to have any authority in the upper circles in England, you had to join the Church.  Here in the colonies, we wanted to cast off all ties with England, and we didn&#8217;t like the way the politicians ran the Church.  We wanted a Freedom of Religion. And to this day, we want religious leaders to influence the moral debate. So this &#8220;wall of separation&#8221; is a 1-way thing. We want politicians to leave the Churches alone, but we very much want Churches to speak out on moral issues.  As to the tax exempt status of the Catholic Church being revoked for &#8220;preaching politics&#8221;, note that they aren&#8217;t doing this. They are preaching MORALITY, and that is independent of anyone&#8217;s political party.  As to the Church &#8220;forcing it down the throats&#8221; of people like Biden or Pelosi, they aren&#8217;t doing that either. All churches (and all clubs of any kind for that matter), are composed of people who have something in common and get together to celebrate it as a binding force, as something that makes them &#8220;one&#8221;. The Catholic Church is a group of people who wrote a Creed of what WE BELIEVE in common, and it has ALWAYS held that abortion is murder. If you think otherwise, you are always free to leave.  In the cases of Biden and Pelosi, this Creed was there long before they chose to profess it and thereby join the Church.  Today they feel different, so today, they are no longer one of &#8220;US&#8221;.  And that&#8217;s all Archbishop Burke said, and he said it because it&#8217;s the truth.</p>
<p>Now as to all the comments about views on war, the death penalty, homosexuality, hypocracy, and so on, the old saying goes &#8220;what does any of that have to do with the price of tea in China?&#8221;  When the discussion is about those other subjects, then fine, we&#8217;ll address them at that time.  But when it is about the Church&#8217;s view on abortion, then stick to that.  Arbitrarily changing the subject in the middle of a debate is a coward&#8217;s way of admitting he&#8217;s losing the debate, so like a spoiled child, he throws mud where ever he can. But it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that he&#8217;s lost the debate.  Archbishop Burke was totally right in what he said, and I applaud him for having the guts to stand up to the &#8220;Morons on Parade&#8221;.  He told the truth.  And you Morons can&#8217;t stand it. I look forward to your turning 9 or even 10 years old (in other words, grow up babies).</p>

                        <p>Actually none of these politicians have actually been denied communion. Accepting communion means that you follow the Catholic church&#8217;s precepts. The Catholic church is a Pro-Life church, the Bishops had every right to speak up when two of their &#8220;faithful&#8221; mis stated Church teaching. On the whole &#8220;How can you be Pro-Life but Pro-War?&#8221; thing&#8230; No one is Pro-War. War can be a tool to stop violent regimes to stop people from invading other lands, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t work out as we&#8217;d hope. We don&#8217;t go to war to kill as many indiscriminate people as possible&#8230; But there is only one reason to go into an abortion clinic. To end a pregnancy&#8230; And what does that entail? The very weakest among us deserve better.</p>

                        <p>The concern of the Catholic Church is the salvation of souls.  It is part of cannon law that any Roman Catholic who participates in any way, encourages, pays for, performs, undergoes, or votes for abortion is automatically excommunicated.  If such a an excommicant recieves Holy Communion he commits mortal sin.  Archbishop Burke is merely stating longstanding Church teaching.  His goal is to bring such people back to the truths of Holy Mother Church.  Catholic politicians who support abortion, and those who vote for them are putting their souls in the gravest danger.  It is not just Amercian unborn, every year 50,000,000 surgical abortions occur worldwide, most done for purely elective reasons.  That does not count the ones killed by abortifacient drugs and devices.  This is a crime bigger than any in history.  Those who say the Church should not speak about this most monstous bloodbath in the history of the world are fools or cowards. It is exactly the job of the princes of the Church to &#8220;suffer the little ones&#8221; to be protected.  The famed separation of church and state comes from a letter of Jefferson.  It applied to the federal government.  Let those who think it is just a blob of tissue go to Population Research Institue and read about how our foreign aid helps spread abortions around the world.  If you dare,and have the stomach for it, go to the site of Dr. Robert Suengenis where you will find a video of an actual aboriton.  The democrats support all of this, it is in their party platform.  And now Obama, it turns out, does not support giving medical treament to babies, outside the womb, who have survived abortions.  The most dangerous place in the world for an unborn child has now become his mother&#8217;s womb.  The slaughter is far worse than Mao, Stalin, and Hitler combined,yet the democrats defend it all.  If that is not a &#8220;party of death&#8221; non ever existed. Do we build a better future for ouselves in the blood of innocents?  May God forgive us all.</p>

                        <p>I am a faithful, practicing Catholic, and I am a Democrat. I support the party despite its position on abortion. Church teaching states that this is an appropriate result of prayerful discernment. A Catholic (like me) can and will vote on the basis of other faith-based issues including care for the poor and sick, opposition to pre-emptive war, opposition to torture, concern for the environment, etc. I believe as a Catholic I can work for an end to abortion in other ways, such as helping those faced with that (currently legal) choice. This is what my prayer has led me to. I vote Obama/Biden.</p>

<p>I am adopted. I could have been aborted, but instead was allowed into this world and have had the privilege of helping many people in many ways. I am beside myself to think that selfishness could prompt individuals, claiming to be Catholic, who want to lead our country, allow &#8211; and support &#8211; the murder of the unborn.</p>
<p>This year I was confirmed as a Catholic. While I always knew deep in my soul that abortion was wrong, I now have the right understanding of why this is so. </p>

<p>Anyway &#8211; that comment aside &#8211; I firmly believe that abortion is a choice. The same as murder is a choice. Theft is a choice. Adultery is a choice. There are also consequences and responsibilities involved. Unfortunately, the first on the list has been moved away from a civil rights issue to a political issue. Perhaps that will one day change.</p>

                        <p>The indoctrination process for becoming a liberal is to first define all morality as relative.  Next use the historical record of any group that opposes their leftist ideology to destroy it&#8217;s credibilty.  Of course the dishonesty of this approach is self-evident as every single organization or religion with traditional values has a history with bad chapters.  For liberals, their &#8220;new&#8221; approach has no historical record to compare and so above reproach.  But no, there is and it&#8217;s practiced in North Korea and Cuba.  Old message, new packaging.<br />
  So contiue sucking the brains out of babies and calling a choice.  If you wouldn&#8217;t be any more disturbed by seeing a pic of an aborted baby than you would of seeing one of a removed gall stone, then you could vote Democrat.</p>

<p>By the way, it&#8217;s not an &#8220;attack&#8221; if it is true.<br />
It is only becomes an attack when the editor of this piece supports abortion on demand, and probably disdains babies and Catholics.<br />

                        <p>It is not a sin if a Catholic believes in his heart of hearts that abortion is not a sin. What is terrible wrong is when an influential Catholic, be it a politician, journalist or an actor, speaks out in support of abortion. His words, his actions in passing laws may indeed enable someone to abort an unborn child. These same Catholics who are in the public eye could just as well say that it is a personal matter and I will not discuss my feelings on the subject.</p>

                        <p>When the Republicans bring up going to war, its not to kill the innocent people.<br />
I&#8217;m sure most of you know why we go to war, though i&#8217;ll still educate you.<br />
Either they (whoever it may be) attack us, or are planning to attack us, or planning to attack an ally. And when we sign a treaty to go to war if our ally does, then we have to. Or we wouldn&#8217;t be a Country of our word.<br />
When Democrats bring up abortion, Its about getting a woman&#8217;s vote. I doubt they think at all about what they say they&#8217;re supporting. And if you don&#8217;t follow Catholic doctrine, you should be refused communion.</p>

                        <p>Abortion is about the murdering of INNOCENT life.</p>
<p>The fourteenth amendment reiterates our basic principles: &#8220;nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>What due process has an unborn child had (conversely, this clearly explains how pro-lifers like myself justify the death penalty).</p>
<p>&#8220;At the heart of the controversy in these cases are those recurring pregnancies that pose no danger whatsoever to the life or health of the mother but are, nevertheless, unwanted for any one or more of a variety of reasons — convenience, family planning, economics, dislike of children, the embarrassment of illegitimacy, etc. &#8230; I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court&#8217;s judgment. &#8230; As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court.&#8221; — Justice Byron R.

  In Catholic teaching there is such a thing as &#8220;false conscience&#8221; that is what you are espousing. You cannot take infanticide and pretend it is OK because somehow you have twisted your thinking to pretend it is a good thing. You can try to talk yourself into these phoney positions but you know in your dark little heart they are wrong, which is why you rail against anyone who speaks to the truth of the matter.</p>

                        <p>Abortion = Murder.  Those who practice, perform or support abortion, therefore, support murder.  Politicians and Political Parties&#8230; EITHER or ALL&#8230; stand guilty.  &#8220;Pro-Choice&#8221; is a white-washed tomb.  &#8220;Pro-Murder&#8221; is more the truth.

                        <p>Through all the discussion of Archbishop Burke&#8217;s statement we can discern an undercurrent of emotional, spiritual and mental anguish existent in the pro-abortion comments. This mirrors the trend we see in Democratic Party politics, that of coalescing those seeking self-destruction, sexual and morally perverse lifestyles, and every manner of socially degenerate and irresponsible behavior into their constituency. Irrespective of the Constitution, they would force everyone to accept their religion celebrating atheism and perversion, under the guise of hate laws &#8211; an anti-Bible codified into law.</p>
<p>God recognizes the mental disorder inherent in these people, as should we. We are, therefore, duty bound to deny the Democratic Party any further access to power until such time as the spiritual evil at the core of their affliction is exorcised. Until then we must recognize that spiritual evil exists, in the same way that redemption through Jesus Christ exists. The faithful should not negotiate nor discuss these issues with those possessed of evil, rather they should fervently pray for their healing salvation. There is no disease of the mind or spirit that can stand up to a daily dose of prayer and blessing. Arguing with the afflicted is pointless.</p>

                        <p>So many of these response are pure politics.  The CHurch is required to uphold its doctrines and to discipline its constituents who err.<br />
When these constituents ar high profile dems, the liberal ungodly go bizirk.  The church is the church and it has taken its moral responsibilities seriously.  THankfully so. WE are a nation of high moral standards, I wish that the Baptists had done this to Bill CLinton, they apparently don&#8217;t have the same moral fiber.<br />
Morality needs to stop being legislated, so we need to get rid of liberal judges who have predetermined to make us an amoral society.</p>

                        <p>The church can gripe all they want in their city covered in gold and stolen artwork&#8230;they can shout from the highest mountain about how &#8220;wrong&#8221; everyone who doesn&#8217;t believe their mindless crap is but at the end of the day the greatest thing about this country is the choices we are free to have.  The Catholic church is responsible for more terror, genocide and pain than any other institution in human history.  The Vatican makes the Third Reich look like a happiest place on Earth when viewed through the lens of unbiased history.  Hitler wished he could kill half the number of people that the church did in it&#8217;s history.  They have no platform of righteousness to stand on, they are the biggest hypocrites of all time.    I don&#8217;t agree with abortion but I will tolerate it because it&#8217;s not my place to tell anyone else what to do.  If people want to take on the emotional burden of abortion that&#8217;s their choice to live with.  Life does NOT begin with conception&#8230;it&#8217;s a ball of cells for many weeks before it even comes close to resembling anything human.  If it can&#8217;t survive on it&#8217;s own outside the body it is not a human being&#8230;it&#8217;s the potential to be a human but that&#8217;s it.  Instead of focusing intently on everyone else, people should focus on their own beliefs and morals and butt out of everyone else&#8217;s business.  The purpose of government isn&#8217;t to legislate morality.  Killing a living, breathing person is a crime because they are living and breathing.  I agree that if you don&#8217;t want a kid take preventive measures of birth control.  Sex is a beautiful, natural part of life&#8230;animals engage in it for fun, it&#8217;s part of biology.  There is NOTHING shameful or &#8220;sinful&#8221; about it.  I got a vasectomy because I want to engage in sex without worrying about a child.  But the religious zealots seem to think that abstinence is the only way but all you have to do is look at how abstinence education has failed universally.  90% of all teens that take that idiotic pledge break it, why?  Because it&#8217;s natural and part of our biology and there is no way that will ever change.  Religion has no place in the political sphere, it&#8217;s just a mindless distraction from the real problems of the world&#8230;war, disease, OVERCROWDING and poverty.  The government needs to focus on people that are already alive&#8230;</p>

They have gamed the system and foisted much of this filthy minority thinking into laws upon the majority. It will be like the forthcoming expose of the Democrats stuffing the ballot box using absentee ballots after the fact they got Obama elected. The American voting system is being contaminated by this scum Democrat party.Tolerance is one thing but laws are binding. This scum thinking is prevailing. We can no longer be silent.

                        <p>Pro-life and pro-choice are meaningless phrases. The abortion issue is about who makes the decision, the government, or the woman involved. Sarah Palin chose to have Trig, and I applaud her. Pro-choice dos not mean pro-abort. Many so called pro-life people are pro-war and pro-death penalty. One is either anti-abortion or pro-abortion. Very few people are actually pro-abortion.</p>

                        <p>Is the Catholic Church prepared to forfeit its tax-exempt status? I am Catholic and I am proud of all the Catholic Church has done for social justice in America over its long history. The safety of factory workers and the civil rights of Black Americans were hard fought. But now the church is entering the realm of personal politics in a very public way. Over recent years, Catholic bishops have found no moral issue with routinely threatening to withhold Communion from Democratic politicians, naming many (including current VP contender Joseph Biden by name). The same church that failed to weigh in on Nazism until the dust had cleared now threatens the mortal souls of U.S. politicians in a strong-arm attempt to influence day-to-day politics. How &#8230; human of them.</p>

                        <p>Very simple solution. Excommunicate Biden, Kerry, Ted Kennedy, Pelosi and any other Catholic politician who supports abortion or any other matter that is against church policy and biblical principles. Deny them communion, a Priest to conduct their funeral and any other church service until they recant.</p>

Liberals, who mostly don&#8217;t believe in God, apparently think doctors should get that second chance &#8211; BHO is no exception and he voted nay on an IL law designed to protect those innocent lives OUTSIDE THE WOMB.

                        <p>The point is that all life should be protected from inception to natural death.  The specific issue that separates abortion from all other issues is that it is the only life that has absolutely no chance of defending itself.  The scariest part of abortion is that it pits humanity against itself, by destroying its own future.</p>
<p>The only medical procedure where half of the patients live thru it.</p>

                        <p>In the weekly newspaper &#8220;The Wanderer&#8221; a couple of issues ago there is an article titled &#8220;Kansas Bishops Call Voting For a Pro-Abort &#8220;Evil&#8221;&#8221; In this article the Kansas Bishops released a voter&#8217;s guide that states &#8220;Catholics who cast a vote for a politician who supports abortion and same-sex marriage commit moral evil&#8221;,in other words a mortal sin. It&#8217;s about time that our Bishops finally are publicly stating truth. If one does not like it join the Episcipal church where they allow Gay bishops or some other watered church under the banner of &#8220;Christian&#8221; that share your views. But don&#8217;t call yourself a Catholic in good standing when you know that these politicians regardless of political party are pro abortion and you go ahead and vote for them, by the way pro-choice is the same as pro-abortion. On matters of Faith and Morals it is the Catholic Church that has always teached and posseses these truths and the Bishops along with the Pope are keepers of this truth. Sounds like peoples consciouses are bothering them.</p>

                        <p>Bravo for the archbishop. It is one thing to disagree with the Church&#8217;s orthodoxy. It is altogether another thing entirely to misrepresent it. Both Pelosi and Biden know better. Their comments are bitter, bitter words to hear from the lips of Catholics high in the American government. Much better for them to have simply said, &#8220;my conscience does not allow me to agree with Church teaching.&#8221; In politics, it is too easy to misrepresent the position of another with whom one does not agree. It gives a comfort that is false and, when put into practice repeatedly, it invites comparison with the dark spectre of a lie.</p>

                        <p>Since high profile people in the Democrat Party insist on touting their Catholic Faith as a badge of honor I see that the Church has every right to call them on it when they dis the tenent of the Faith.  They don&#8217;t have to be Catholic but they seem to feel they need the Church to assure their election because of the number of Catholics in their districts.<br />
The Church has always been against Abortion and no amount of excuses from the so-called-Catholic candidates can change that so in that context the Democrats are the Party of DEATH.</p>

War vs Abortion &#8211; equates to &#8211; Evil vs Innocence.<br />
This world is ruled and run by &#8211; evil – it is rampant and growing.<br />
Abortion is murder for convenience sake.<br />
In the infinite wisdom of the creation of all – a conscious was given to all.  Uncover it &#8211; listening to it &#8211; and stop smothering it.<br />
Our hour is near.  And those who laugh – look around&#8230;.<br />
My faith and hope in mankind is lost&#8230;&#8230;evil has won!</p>

<p>Biden, Pelosi, Kennedy, etc., can say what they want, but to then portray themselves as good Catholics is the height of hypcrisy.</p>
<p>More of this from the Vatican will help clarify the teaching of the Church and strengthen the moral foundation of the faithful.  For those with poorly formed consciences, this is helpful to jolt them from the hypnosis of the democrat party, aka the party of death.</p>

                        <p>See there&#8217;s this thing about being a church &#8211; It has to stand for something.  Good of the church to shake the cobwebs out and remember &#8211; oh right, we&#8217;re supposed to teach right from wrong.  Sorry that the conflicted Catholics are thrashing about with their comments here as they remember the words of their mothers and grandmothers on the truths of the church and try to reconcile that with their own life &#8220;choices&#8221; to support the ending of an innocent life.  It must be hard to be wrong and have to rationalize it with excuses that ring hollow like &#8220;I know life is sacred, but we should be able to kill a baby from rape or incest&#8230;&#8221;  Troubling?

                        <p>1) The vatican&#8217;s opinions on our political process is irrelevant.</p>
<p>2) Anti-war nuts do not live in the real world. There exists no absolute peace in this world. If you want absolute peace, go to the afterlife. War exists here. People want to kill us because we are not them. Appeasement has never worked in all of human history, and it never will work. Read your history. These people are not rational and cannot be &#8216;enlightened to a rational viewpoint&#8217;. Neither can the idiots who believe appeasing them will do any good. War cannot be avoided indefinitely. War can only be delayed by creating a Statist Fascist world-wide government that oppresses personal and political freedoms, which would only delay war until the oppressed people rise up and overthrow such an idiotic government. People will continue to hate other people who are different as long as such behavior is excused and perpetrated.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this: How would you feel if these terrorists found a way to kill 1 million Americans or more?</p>
<p>How would you feel if Russia managed to throw a nuke our way?</p>
<p>How would you feel if the Democrats won power in the House, Senate, and the White House and remade the United States of America into the Socialist States of America, betraying the very principles upon which this great nation was founded?</p>
<p>How would you feel if the Economy crashed to the point where only those with millions of dollars could keep themselves off the streets because the Democrats have only 1 strategy for economic change that they apply to EVERY situation no matter whether it&#8217;s appropriate to the situation or not: raise taxes and tariffs, more corporate regulation, more regulation on small business, paying lower class citizens with proceeds from tax hikes for the rich and corporations (redistribution of wealth, a tenant of Socialism)&#8230;</p>
<p>This country has Capitalism, which is incompatible with Socialism, and our economy is suffering not because capitalism failed, but because it&#8217;s clogged up with socialistic structures that have been installed by Democrats ever since Carter.</p>
<p>Democrats KNOW how Capitalism works, and they KNOW that the Fiscal Conservative principles lead to economic and financial prosperity for Everyone, however they WANT the economy to fail so that they can replace Capitalism with a Socialist state controlled economy. And I won&#8217;t have it.</p>
<p>And before you try to tell me the Democrats are not socialists and are not inserting socialist structures into our economy, go and look up the definition and the tenants of Socialism. Then go look up how capitalism works.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that the Republicans of the past century have been corrupt. However, they were Rockerfeller republicans who believed in Lazzier-Faire capitalism, which is predatory. That breed of Republican is nearly extinct. Neocon Republicans are Big Government and are far more far right than fiscal conservatives. Both Pres. Bush are Neocons. They do not represent the principles of fiscal conservatism and small government.</p>
<p>So you ultra left liberal pin-heads need to get with the modern era. The Neocons have lost power. The Evangelical Right have lost power. Palin may belong to a church that is commonly referred to as evangelical, however, Gov. Palin does not believe in pushing her religious beliefs on others, and thus will not support nor ban any laws having to do with religion. She is not a threat to Roe v Wade.</p>
<p>This is no longer the extreme right vs the moderate left. This is now the moderate right vs the extreme left. Any time the right or the left go extreme, the more moderate of the two wins.</p>
<p>This is why McCain will win this election. The average american people are seeing just how socialistic Obama is, and how moderate McCain is.</p>

                        <p>In response to Michael Cecil; the Republican party being the party of life has little to do with it&#8217;s position on warfare and support for it&#8217;s allies &#8211; Simply put, it comes down to the teachings of the Church and deeply held moral beliefs as to the beginning of life; for one to personally oppose abortion but publicly support it is a direct contradiction and shows the truth of their beliefs.</p>

                        <p>Here&#8217;s a fun fact: 5 of the 7 Justices who voted for Roe were appointed by Republican presidents. Today, 7 of the 9 Justices on the Court are Republican appointees.  5 of those are Catholic Republicans, in communion with the Church.  Still, Casey v. Planned Parenthood (not Roe v. Wade) remains the law of the land.  Apparently Republicans have no stomach to change the current law, so go ahead and waste your votes.  Our President has never proposed legislation restricting abortion, neither has John McCain.  On the other hand, according to the Catholic encyclopedia, adulterous women who obtained abortions in France used to be buried alive.  It must have been a great lesson to them</p>

                        <p>&#8220;Life does NOT begin with conception…it’s a ball of cells for many weeks before it even comes close to resembling anything human. If it can’t survive on it’s own outside the body it is not a human being…it’s the potential to be a human but that’s it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nick E. @11:50AM on 10/3 has it right.<br />
Oh, and for all you catholics out there, the soul doesn&#8217;t enter the body UNTIL the new human draws its FIRST BREATH! Coincidently, the soul leaves the body after the human&#8217;s LAST BREATH! </p>
<p>If you ever bothered to read the Bible, you would understand the importance of BREATH&#8230;</p>

                        <p>The Catholic Church teaches that wars are possible provided the circumstances meet a specific criteria.  In general, in order to be a &#8216;just war&#8217; they must be in defense only (of either ones self or another).  Frankly the war in iraq woulsd not meet the criteria of a just war and Pope John Paul II was close to saying so before he died.</p>
<p>Further the Church does not make a distinction between what a life is.  Either it is or it is not.  As such Church doctrine teaches that life is the highest gift provided to us by the creator.  It is a sin to kill ones self and likewise it is a sin to kill someone else outside of the permissable circumstances of a just war or self defense.  That being so why isn&#8217;t the church preaching against artificial insemination or more importantly fertility drugs.  This is how all those surplus stem cells are brought into the world.  Clincs simply do away with unused fertilized eggs-isn&#8217;t that tanamount to abortion or murder?  Yet many so called born agains use fertility drugs to have kids.</p>
<p>We too often want to twist the Bible or a church&#8217;s doctrin to a situational interpretation rather than a global interpretation.  Simply murder in any form is bad so why don&#8217;t we stick to that and see how things turn out.</p>

We should recall our ambassador or whatever that we have there and throw their ambassodor out of the country.

<p>Proud, but bigoted.  You wouldn&#8217;t happen to belong to Reverend Wright&#8217;s church, would you?</p>
<p>&gt;This is just a ridiculous abuse of religious power. </p>
<p>No, it isn&#8217;t.  Pelosi and Biden misrepresented Catholic doctrine.  By rights they were risking excommunication for heresy, but that was their choice from the beginning.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear on something, shall we?  Nobody is forcing Pelosi and Biden to be Catholic.  They could join half a hundred Protestant churches just like yours that would sanction their pro-death positions.  They haven&#8217;t done that &#8211; instead, they&#8217;ve tried to force the Vatican to see things their way.  Sounds more like Government is trying to impose its positions on the Church instead &#8211; which violates the non-establishment clause in the Constitution.  They&#8217;re actually trying to impose Government doctrine on abortion on American Catholics.</p>
<p>&gt;This person isn’t even IN the United States of America.</p>
<p>So?  </p>
<p>Archbishop Burke hasn&#8217;t renounced his citizenship.  In fact his status as an American gives the statement more impact than it would have had otherwise.  </p>
<p>&gt;How does he get off bashing American politicians? </p>
<p>Because they are supposed to be Catholic, and they are mis-representing Church doctrine.  The Pope himself did the same thing in 2004 when he was running the Inquisition.  Pelosi, Biden, etc. can feel free to keep supporting infanticide all they want &#8211; they just won&#8217;t be part of the Catholic Church for much longer if they keep at it &#8211; and the Church is well within its rights to throw them out.</p>
<p>&gt;They never made an oath to preach the gospel of the &gt;Catholic Church in their position of political &gt;authority. </p>
<p>No, they just took an oath to defend the US Constitution &#8211; which states that government officials cannot dictate doctrine to religious entities.</p>

                        <p>Catholic politicians and Catholic Democrats should boycott the Catholic Church. Remove all their tax except status in the US and demand apology from the Vatican.  What an outrageous statement from a group hypocrites.<br />
Perverts who prefer little boys to play with in the name of God. Looking down on people who do not agree with the old ways of the church to pass judgment of others.  Would prefer an abusive women to stay with her abuser and belittle her saying a good Catholic would not seek divorce.<br />
This coming from those who believe giving illegal aligns asylum in US churches is a good thing, because those aborted US babies are not in the workforce. This is why we have separation of church and state people.  Too many wars have been fought because of religious beliefs so the exception is okay to KILL IN THE NAME OF GOD.  Just contacted my Catholic church and informed them that we will rally together and boycott the church and statement made by Archbishop Raymond Burke. It&#8217;s time for change and that goes for my Catholic church also.</p>

                        <p>I guess the Catholic church forgot about the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition and all the other wars it fought in its attempt to convert others to Catholicism, and as a result thousands died. The Catholic church should have its tax exempt status revoked for being an active participant in the political process. It should also be indicted under RICO for its cover-up of all the sexual assaults by their employees. The Catholic church speaks with a forked tongue. The Catholic church has no moral base on which to stand and their passing judgment on the moral compass of others is ridiculous.</p>

                        <p>It is very interesting to see all the pro-abortion commentariat changing the subject from abortion to war, tax-exempt status and the death penalty because a few prominent &#8220;Catholic&#8221; politicians get called out for what they are, hypocrites.  They are free to attend another church that permits their congregation to abort children and they can still support their beloved union thugs.  Permit me to recommend the United Church of Christ.</p>

                        <p>Why are they worried about abortion in the US when there is genocide going on in Sudan? I don&#8217;t see the Catholic church doing much to stop the killing of already borned children and the rape of women. I am Catholic but I am disgusted with the way the US Catholic church has behaved. So it is ok for a priest to rape a young boy but not ok for a woman to choose what to do with her body? Don&#8217;t tell me what to do when you yourself don&#8217;t follow your own ideologies.</p>

                        <p>Roe vs Wade should be overturned.<br />
Based on the simple legal fact that we have separation of powers in the US Constitution. Only Congress, the Legislature, can actually pass laws.<br />
In this case the Supreme Court (the &#8220;Judiciary) in effect made law. It is unconstitutional.<br />
Supreme Court decisions for that reason when they come to a conclusion always states &#8220;it is the OPINION&#8221; of the Court&#8230;etc&#8221; </p>
<p>Let therefore Congress debate a bill and clearly vote up or down on a bill that allows killing of babies in the womb. And see how members of our Legislature vote according his or her conscious.<br />
I almost guarantee that when it is up to each individual it won&#8217;t pass. Now, conveniently they can cowardly hide behind the Supreme Court.</p>

                        <p>The church is not wrong about the abortion issue. But it doesn&#8217;t like that we have separation of church and state in this country, because not everyone agrees on the Church&#8217;s definition of the beginning of life and thus, what the law should be. </p>
<p>But the bigger truth here is that the Church is very happy with the Republican party because it is more of a religious organization than a political party.</p>
<p>It is angry that it has no control of the Democrats and is using the abortion issue to try to change that.</p>

                        <p>I think that the whole argument is summed up by a pro-abortion guy named Dave.  He says that he had sex and that it resulted in a &#8216;mistake&#8217; that&#8217;s 8 years old.  His son is a &#8216;mistake&#8217;.  I feel so sorry for that child and wish that he could be raised in a loving home where he would be seen as a gift of God.  That&#8217;s what every child is and it&#8217;s not dependent on whether you&#8217;re &#8216;wanted&#8217; or &#8216;unwanted&#8217;.  That&#8217;s the difference in a nutshell &#8211; party of &#8216;my child is a mistake&#8217; or party of &#8216;my child is a gift of God&#8217;.   Obama also says an &#8216;unplanned&#8217; child is a &#8216;punishment&#8217;.  How can anyone think the Dems are an attractive party?

                        <p>Ok so the Catholic Church isn&#8217;t perfect, but atleast today in this crucial hour are taking a stand against the HOLOCAUST of Abortion. It&#8217;s so easy for people to throw the Crusades in modern Catholic Church face, when that is something that is long gone. Meanwhile the Muslims are still torturing and killing those who convert to Christianity. So while the Muslims are crusading still we are focused on a stain in the 13th Century Church. Have they not repented? I believe we are entering into a season where God is waking up the Church Catholics, Protestants to the things of His heart and we will see a huge shift.</p>

Let&#8217;s remember it&#8217;s was a personal choice to own a slave or not, because the common thought was black people weren&#8217;t wholly human.  If it wasn&#8217;t for a &#8220;moralizers&#8221; and &#8220;religious zealots&#8221; who fought and sometimes died for the rights of black human beings, Obama wouldn&#8217;t even have a chance to be president because he isn&#8217;t human enough.  </p>
<p>Give me a break you sick and twisted folks who believe an unborn baby is not a human being therefore is not murder. Morality always wins! Slavery was abolished, equal rights were finally granted and unborn babies will someday be given rights regardless of what you selfish proud and godless think.</p>

                        <p>Seems like it&#8217;s time to remove the 501c(3) status of the Catholic churches in the states. It&#8217;s fine for them to speak out against abortion, but to assign a political value to that stance is illegal for a charitable organization. I have no problem with their doing it, however&#8230; As long as their American parishes also agree to pay taxes [or become a 501c(4, of course)]. But they shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to break the law just because they wear awesome hats&#8230;</p>

                        <p>The first problem with this is that it&#8217;s illegal.  Religious organizations in the US are tax exempt on the condition that they stay out of politics; now that Raymond Burke has inserted the Catholic Church into politics, the Catholic Church should be taxed like every other business.  Hello there, IRS &#8211; go for it! The second problem is that Burke, himself, is dissenting from the Catholic pro-life ethic by supporting the Republican war in Iraq, which the Vatican has declared not to be a just war. Third, as a human being like the rest of us (although he seems to think he&#8217;s better than most people) Burke has no right to judge any one.  Only God can and will judge.  Amen</p>

<p>do you really believe that it is possible to separate your faith life from policy?  If you can, either you don&#8217;t have a genuine faith life (Catholic in name only) or you are a liar!

<p>So it was &#8220;Unehtical&#8221; for Christian abolitionists to push for end of slavery?  It was wrong for Catholics to push for better working conditions in the 1930&#8217;s.  Dave, Science is quite convinced and is in no argument that abortions kill human beings, is this the &#8220;Non-Religious&#8221; evidence you need to support a ban in law?  </p>
<p>Burke is right the Democrats are the Party Of Death.  They are the party of separation.  They split up husbands and wives through extreme feminism and gender politics.  They separate parents from their children by loosening the divorce laws.  They separate men from men and women from women by supporting that there is no such thing as gender identity.  They separate women from their babies through abortion.  They separate people from their faith by their brow-beating bretheran in the media.  Its awful</p>

Advice to Mike, wake up, get a job and support yourself. There is a new revolution in the US under belly and we are going to eliminate losers like Mike. Hey Mike, Castro is offering rice cookers to his people, why not move there. p.s. I am at the hosptial (yes, I have insurane Mike)waiting for my dad to come out of surgery, that&#8217;s why I am not at work there Mike. God Bless America and God Bless Sarah Palin!!!!!</p>

                        <p>This action, while laudable, is 40 years too late.  It is a disgrace that the Catholic Church is silent about the murder of children fostered, encouraged, and paid for by the Democratic party. It is the ultimate lie for these so-called Catholic politicians to say they oppose it but won&#8217;t prevent others from doing what they want.  Now their standard bearer is Obama, who approves the murder of babies who survive abortions.  How could any human brutally murder children the way the Democrats do.</p>

                        <p>The Church DOES speak out against the war in Iraq.  Where have you people been?  If you want to know how the Church interprets scripture and what its teachings are, read the &#8220;Catechism of the Catholic Church&#8221;.  It states  that war is only moral when innocent people or an innocent nation must be defended.  The Vatican continues to encourage American politicians to end the Iraq war.  The Vatican realizes that withdrawl must be done in a responsible way to avoid even greater human suffering. See http://www.georgiabulletin.org/local/200 8/10/02/war/.  By the way, many Dems have and do support the Iraq war.</p>

                        <p>To all of you &#8220;Obama Robots&#8221;, the &#8220;separation of church an state&#8221; refers to a &#8220;state imposed religion&#8221;.  It does not mean the censorship of religion.  If you don&#8217;t want to believe in God and would rather worship crystals in New Mexico, that&#8217;s your right.  However, if you call yourself a Catholic, you can&#8217;t have it both ways like Kerry, Pelosi ,and Biden would like to.  I think that these people should be excommunitaeed from the church.  Yes, the Democrat party is certainly NOT the Democrat party of our parents.  It is now a branch of the international Communist party, and as such, the party of death.</p>

We have a president sending men to war and loss of their life for his own special reasons, not facts. We have people who are homeless. We have children abused and going hungry. We have people dying with no health care. Church where are you on these issues? I am personally against abortion, but I go for the words &#8220;Let he who is without sin caste the first stone&#8221; and I think He was a bigger authority than even the Pope.

                        <p>To be Catholic and vote for Obama is a sin.  Sometimes you can go to jail for being guilty by association.  In this case I see voting for the party of death as a sin and putting people&#8217;s mortal souls at risk.  Obama supports killing babies so long as the mother wants the infant dead.  In the event that the baby is accidentally born during the murderous event Obama supports letting the viable baby die&#8230;because the mother wanted it dead.  The truth is that abortion is a barbaric procedure that dismembers the baby to remove it from the womb.  All Catholics have an obligation to vote for life and to not tolerate this barbaric sacrilege.</p>

<p>The black robes, in the name of &#8220;social evolution,&#8221; have again usurped American&#8217;s of their rignt to self-govern.</p>

                        <p>The word of God has taught me what the Catholic failed to teach me and that is &#8220;Judge not.&#8221; It is blasphemous for Vatican not to introduce the word of God, the Bible into their congregation and instead brainwash them from infants into their adulthood with their hypocritical dogma. The Vatican must begin to look back into their shameful closet and stop being judgmentally political and instead spread the truth from the Bible. This pious falsehood image of the Vatican is what the Blessed Virgin Mary reveals to some; weeping and lamenting of the prostituting portrayal of her and son, Jesus Christ. Do not pick part nor shape parts of the Ten Commandments and politicize to cover up the despicable shameful past, but live all the ten.</p>

                        <p>I love how libtards get all preachy about &#8220;don&#8217;t legislate your beliefs onto others&#8221; when they consistently legislate their own beliefs onto others. Isn&#8217;t it libtards legislating that homosexual marriage must be recognized by everyone. Isn&#8217;t marriage founded in a religous belief system? Doesn&#8217;t that mean libtards are legislating thier beliefs onto others?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it libtards that legislated that banks must lend money to people who cannot pay it back. Didn&#8217;t this idealistic dream just explode all over the economy. And aren&#8217;t the very people the libtards think this was going to help going to suffer the most?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it libtards that legislated that prison is about reforming people rather than punishing them and keeping them out of society. So now child rapists are routinely set free to victmize more innocent children, theives rob more innocent people, and murders have the opportunity to kill again. This is why I support the death penalty, libtards cannot be trusted to keep evil people locked up.</p>
<p>Libtards just make excuse after excuse for being socialist passivists and have no moral foundation whatsoever. And I know any libtard reading this will think I am a religous nut. But I am agnostic and haven&#8217;t been in any church in over 20 years. I dislike religion. But I disagree strongly with liberal social engineering as it is selfish, idealistic, and naive and anyone with sense knows it.</p>

                        <p>Since the bishops have taken a vow of obedience to the pope, one can assume the bishops are representatives of the holy see which has diplomatic relations with the US. Therefore any bishop who refuses to cooperate with local law enforcement and prosecutors re: sex abuse scandal should immediately be declared persona non grata and will be deported to the vatican.</p>

                        <p>To Tom L.:  The Church does teach against artifical insemination and the intentional practice of creating multiple embryos and killing the &#8220;extras&#8221;.</p>
<p>To those who say that the Church is hypocritical for being against war when it commited atrocities such as inquisitions and crusades:  The Church is made up of sinners, just like any other human institution (teachers, doctors, laborers, non-Catholic Christian leaders, politicians, etc.).  Many members of the Church sinned in the past and sin now.  Even so, the Church&#8217;s teachings never included unjustified war.  These things happened because the members of the Church ingnored the Church&#8217;s teachings.  We are blessed that we live in a time when the Church&#8217;s members are more aligned with Christ&#8217;s teachings than any other time since Christ walked the earth.  Members will continue to sin, just as all humans do.  This is no reason to chunk the church that Christ founded.  God will work things out in his own time and his Church will prevail against the gates of Hell until Christ comes again at the end of time.</p>

<p>Anyone who doubts that a human person is such before 9 months should visit their local hospital&#8217;s NICU and see the preemies. See which ones you&#8217;d agree to allow to be killed.</p>
<p>What are the consequences of being wrong about abortion? They could be considerable for the woman and maybe others too; but, how does that compare to being killed and being responsible for the killing? </p>
<p>If Republicans and Catholics are wrong to be hypocritical war-mongers, desiring to kill everything but unborn babies, then surely all that killing must be wrong. If you&#8217;re against all that killing isn&#8217;t it inconsistent to be supporting letting babies be killed?</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, the Catholic church is only partially correct.  The fact is, that Democrats see children as &#8220;unsuccessful abortions&#8221; &#8211; ones that slipped past the goalie (AKA Dr. Tiller).  The ones that survive are then sent to liberal re-education camps (AKA Public Schools), then have to run the gauntlet of constituent groups (NAMBLA, Gay/Lesbian/Transgender grooming, etc.).  The ones that survive and express Good Thinking are then registered as Democrat Voters &#8211; whether they actually vote or not.  Rejects of all of the above are seen as conservatives.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that calling the Democratic party the party of death is a severe understatement.  They are more insidious than radical Islam, by indoctrinating and sexualizing the children they aren&#8217;t able to kill.</p>

&gt;The Catholic Church teaches that wars are possible &gt;provided the circumstances meet a specific criteria. In &gt;general, in order to be a ‘just war’ they must be in &gt;defense only (of either ones self or another). </p>
<p>Iraqi civilian deaths since 2003 &#8211; 90K</p>
<p>Iraqi civilian deaths due to the 2003 invasion itself &#8211; less than 8000.</p>
<p>(Source &#8211; www.iraqbodycount.org)</p>
<p>Conclusion &#8211; vast majority of civilian deaths since 2003 have come about as a result of the foreign nationals who came in to fight on behalf of Al-Qaeda.  </p>
<p>Conclusion #2 &#8211; Decrease in civilian deaths since August 2007 was due to increased security, thanks to greater troop strength from the US and indigenous forces.  </p>
<p>Iraqi civilian deaths under Saddam were quite a bit higher.  182,000 in the Anfal campaign alone, and about 30-60K during the Shiite revolts and the Marsh Arab clearances.</p>
<p>&gt;Frankly<br />
&gt;the war in iraq woulsd not meet the criteria of a just &gt;war and Pope John Paul II was close to saying so before &gt;he died.</p>
<p>Gulf War I met the criteria, though.  </p>
<p>And that action never formally ended.   A cease-fire was in place instead, as the Coalition and the UN found it necessary to use the threat of resumption of hostilities as leverage against Saddam not following the terms of UNSC 687.  Saddam didn&#8217;t follow terms.  Hostilities resumed.  </p>
<p>If you disbelieve any of this, feel free to check out the details on your own.</p>

                        <p>For those of you who want to bring the crusades and the Spanish Inquisition into this discussion, you better get more informed about the facts.  The Inquisition was a STATE inquisition not completely sanctioned by the church.  The crusades, although sanctioned by the church was not sanctioned for all of them. The crusades, especially the first, were to liberate the Christians from Muslim who were being killed in vast numbers (as were the Jews).</p>
<p>The jest of this article is that catholic leaders, who profess their catholic faith as the most important part of their lives, are being told to live their faith through their actions.  To interject that this is a republican problem and that we may nuke Iran is absolute nonsense.  The duties of every christian is to first let their friends know when they are wrong and are in sin.  If that doesn&#8217;t right the wrong, then it is the christian&#8217;s responsibility to publicly tell them they are wrong.  We need to be constantly told how to get to heaven and if it is by public humiliation than so be it.</p>

                        <p>Wow, sure is a lot of hate out there for Catholics. All of you with your condescending comments need to go out and realize what a beautiful life you have and be thankful for it. If you can&#8217;t, go get a gun and put yourself out of our misery of listening to you, although I must tell you the Catholic Church will be against you committing suicide, so you may then have to stick around and write how out of touch the Church is.</p>
<p>The Vatican is against anything that takes a human life, be it abortion, war, euthanasia, etc. No-one here should even begin to explain when the soul enters the body because nobody knows, that is why the church takes the position it does. There are only three beings that know: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. For all we know, the soul doesn&#8217;t enter the body until we are ready to die, so using that argument, most of you here should probably be aborted as you don&#8217;t have a soul. </p>
<p>And lastly, those of you that are going back 500+ years and comparing the churches actions then to now ….. get a life. I would love to see you hold a medical discussion comparing how 15th century doctors could better perform brain surgery on a modern day person by drilling into the persons head to let a demon out.</p>

                        <p>Catholic church has zero credibility.  Even ignoring the way they played a shell-game with pedophile priests, this is an organization that preaches meakness, and speaks of the ills of wealth and power yet covets both like no other organization on the planet.</p>
<p>Now doing abject political advocacy?  Time to lose that tax-exempt status.  The Vatican is ridiculously wealthy&#8230;strange being that Jesus was a simple carpenter and threw the money changers out of the temple yet the Vatican itself is decked with finery and gold.</p>

We have to wake up, they are criminals, corrupt, Hollywood garbage, emotional disturb who are out for themselves, and don&#8217;t really care about anyone else. The are for abortion and Obama should be ashamed of himself for allowing partial birth killing of innocent babies. This is not right, where are their values. I was a Democrat for many years, until I grew up and became mature. I could not agree with a party, that had loose morals, and whose values lay in the gutter.

                        <p>So just because somebody is a political leader they are supposed to never speak out about their beliefs? What has happened to the world today? There are people actually standing up for the right to slaughter babies? There are people that actually say it is wrong to speak up for God just because of your position in society? I feel sorry for all of you the day you stand in front of the judgment seat and have to explain why your words lash out in blasphemy. Woe to those who speak such trash. Your day will come.

                        <p>The Catholic Church and all other faiths or non-faiths have every right to instruct and correct those who lay claim to the membership.  In this case, the Catholic Church was simply correcting two members &#8211; Pelosi and Biden &#8211; who claim membership in the Church and yet, deliberately speak IN ERROR as if they are scholars in church dogma.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Church officials have the right to speak in a cautionary tone as an example to the rest of the faithful.  They have the right to &#8220;instruct&#8221; the faithful.</p>
<p>For those of you who react so vehemently against anyone &#8220;legislating their faith,&#8221; you really should be INTELLECTUALLY HONEST and disagree with the position or opinion stated rather than rant &amp; rave about people who live what they believe.</p>

                        <p>It is apparent many here posting comments are not Catholic.  The Catholic doctrine states &#8220;thou shalt not murder&#8221;, which when translated from its original text to English, came out &#8220;thou shalt not kill&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Murder has an entirely different meaning than kill and we Catholics need to remember the difference and the ORIGINAL text as it was written.</p>
<p>Abortion is murder.  War, and all that goes with it, is a necessary evil on this planet and is in no way at odds with Church Doctrine.  Obviously it isn&#8217;t praised, but also not condemned either.</p>
<p>So, if you are going to talk about a subject in which you have no knowledge, at least read a little bit before you comment.</p>
<p>The Bishop is right in this statement (although I have disagreed with him on many others).  Democrats, with their willful adherence to abortion, are the party of Death.</p>

                        <p>Funny, the Catholic church burned untold thousands at the stake for heresy. The Republicans start a war with lies and kill hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in Iraq, and thousands more in Afghanistan. And these hypocrites call the Democrats the party of death because they don&#8217;t want to &#8220;FORCE&#8221; women to have children that they can&#8217;t afford. God said to be fruitful and multiply, not destroy the world with over population. No wonder Christ called church leaders &#8220;SONS OF VIPERS&#8221;.</p>

                        <p>Archbishop is taking a strong moral stand and I applaud him for that. Killing unborn babies is a lot different than defending ourselves against evil lunatics who would destroy the West. The democrats are the party of death, socialism, whining, victims rights and all the the other bad things that are tearing America apart. Some of them know what they are doing because they want to destroy us, but sadly the masses hear Obama make a speech and think if he is elected they will get a great job and all will be well. It is sad and scary at the same time.</p>

                        <p>The Catholic Church is out of touch and simply does not understand one of the principles the United States was founded on; the free, unfettered, exercise of religion.  In order to achieve this religion needs to stay out of politics and out of American laws.  A political candidate&#8217;s personal religious beliefs or dogma is not an appropriate foundation for law making.  In this way, supporting the abortion right is not incongruent from their own personal beliefs.  By Sen. Biden and Speaker Pelosi are merely exercising their good professional judgment and keeping their personal religious teachings out of the abortion debate, they are merely fulfilling their role in representing the whole of their constituency be it Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, or any other religion.  They have to respect everyone&#8217;s rights, without espousing the beliefs of one religion.</p>

                        <p>Abortion is murder, but I&#8217;m still hoping that leftists will go extinct so I no longer must suffer such low quality humans.  Democrats please continue to abort your young and make homosexual the survivors.  In a few generations people will theoretically appreciate life and normalcy again.  I do wonder to what extent someone must loathe themselves to encourage infanticide and homosexuality.  When will your subcultural suicide be complete?</p>

I propose they do a dna test on all babies about to be butchered in the womb. If the test comes back positive that the baby&#8217;s dna is identical to the mothers dna  then she has a &#8220;right&#8221; to kill, murder, abort, or choose. If however the dna comes back human and seperate from the mothers dna then it is not her body and she does not have the right to murder(except in the very rare case that the pregnancy could cause the mother to risk her life&#8230;not her health&#8230;we all know you can&#8217;t give a loophole to a dem&#8230;they would say &#8220;mental health&#8221; and then proceed to chop and hack the baby into little pieces)her HUMAN baby!</p>

                        <p>Party of death is guite apparent. It seems his holliness is coming to this party very late. In any case, 60 million dead babies cannot be wrong. The stats are deploable. It takes one million rapes to produce one pregnancy. Thus sixty million dead children are justified for 60 out of six million occurences. Such stats could easily support the reinstitutionalization of slavery and the dissenfranchising women. This mess did not just become deplorable. Like cord wood, these little bodies have been piling up since the 70&#8217;s. Where was Rome when all these fetus were burned and which party do they think sanctioned these deaths?</p>

                        <p>Comments that bring up events that happened 1000 years ago are just laughable. For years, Democrats have been getting away with creepy and ghoulish pro-abortion stance with the logical fallacy that they support a &#8220;choice&#8221; not abortion. Absurd. Now they&#8217;re getting called on it and to judge from the shrill screeching tone of these comments, the Archbishop has hit them right where it hurts. Love it.</p>

And people who are worried about a Catholic voting from their beliefs, I say people do it all the time whether your a catholic, baptist, muslim or athiest or whatever.  I mean hey, you got the Teachers Union and Teachers wearing Obama pins and encouraging teachers to wear blue in the classroom and teaching children to sing Obama messiah songs. Jees, Everybody is a hypocrite!! At least you know where the Catholic Church stands. And if a member doesn&#8217;t like it a member can always leave.</p>

                        <p>The reality of the matter comes down to this: People are of a particular faith for a number of reasons. Not the least of which is family history.</p>
<p>Unlike Islamic faiths or the Jewish faith and others which are so distinctly intertwined to the fabric of society in certain parts of the world, faith here in the US is mostly an ancillary item.</p>
<p>That is our societal makeup is so diverse such to mean that no one faith uniquely dictates the policies and actions of our government or citizens.</p>
<p>People have the right to disagree with tenets of their faith. That&#8217;s their choice. The same thing is true with regard to party affiliation.</p>
<p>Biden and Pelosi can be Catholics and disagree with the Church&#8217;s view on certain issues, just as they could disagree with tenets of their party if their faith dictates they hold a different opinion.</p>
<p>We cannot be terribly surprised to see the Catholic Church decry those who have a counter opinion to theirs in terms of abortion.  However, I find their words distasteful and inappropriate.</p>
<p>This is why it&#8217;s always funny to me how intolerant many highly religious people are, all while claiming they&#8217;re the only ones who care for peace &amp; harmony.</p>
<p>It just shows you that people (including Clergy) are too often only tolerant of views they agree with.</p>

                        <p>All of you patriotic, suppose to be intelligent and good Americans got your heads still in the sand! Catholics and especially those who serve in the vatican, parishes, and dioceses have abortions. Why haven&#8217;t you heard of the stories the reformed nuns tell of the behavior of the rapist an pedophiles who call themselves priest. Their hypocrisies  makes me want to vomit. Mr. Burke needs to start right in the position he has been appointed to rid the Whore, Satanic Blaspheming church of its self inbreed sodomites.  Further more the catholic church has no right, none whatsoever to speak for the Righteous Lord Jesus Christ. The catholic church sits highly in opposition to the word of God Almighty.  It practices what God says THOU SHALT NOT and it does not practice what God says THOU SHALT. GOD&#8211;JESUS CHRIST DID NOT LEAVE  A SO CALLED SELF MADE HOLY SEE TO SEE AFTER MANKIND. We can go to our FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN FOR OURSELVES,and not by some fake beads called the rosary and confessions.</p>

                        <p>Hey Obama supporters, the black race is being aborted by black women everywhere at the highest rate of all races.  In fact, research it and you will find Planned Parenthood promotes it.    Just think another Martin Luther King has probably been done away with in the name of worshipping at the altar of abortion.  I guess we all will find out what Our Lord thinks about taking a living human being from the womb when we all meet someday.  Is it not better to choose life and let the chips fall where they may?   Stop this nonsense and choose life always!!  Adoption is a beautiful and wonderful choice, look into this option and see what a wonderful future a child could have.</p>

                        <p>For the purpose of power and greed, the early Catholic Church emacerated the original teachings of Jesus and started the Christian religion on a trajectory of devastating misinformation.  Jesus would not approve of what passes for Christianity today.  Everyone owes it to themselves to research the early esoteric/gnostic tenets on their own.</p>

                        <p>Life begins at conception, period.  Those Democrats who call themselves Catholic and yet endorse ABORTION are not Catholics, for they do not follow the teachings of the Bible and Church.  Pelosi, should attend, as a writer above stated the &#8220;Church of Satan&#8221; in San Francisco, as far as Joe Biden and other Democrats who call themselves Catholics, they lost their way and should be excommunicated.  Many of the statements are critical of the Church&#8217;s statement.  You have that right.  However, we Catholics who firmly stand with our Church will follow the church that Jesus Christ himself directed Peter, the apostle to begin, i.e., the rock of which his church will be built upon.  Some of the writers, complain about so-called atrocities over the years, and emphasize WWII.  Evidently, they don&#8217;t realize, the church was operating in secret, saving hundreds of thousands of lives by providing places for all the people Hitler wanted to kill, from Jews to Homosexuals.  The church was protecting life, as it does now.  Even though homosexuality is sinful, saving the life of the sinner is very important to our Catholic teachings, as every life is a gift from God!  Pelosi, Biden, the Kennedys and all Democratics who call themselves Catholics are lying to theirselves.</p>

And yet, as some of you pointed out, a deafening silence about the issues of torture and the ongoing war.  I left the catholic church about 8 years ago when the Vatican agreed to meet with the the warlord W.  Even though John Paul read a statement about the war and torture, no big outcry came from ANY OTHER of the church&#8217;s princes. A big change from the parish activism against the Vietnam war.</p>

                        <p>Just for clarification, The bible in the old testament is written in Hebrew. The commandment, &#8220;Thou Shalt not Kill&#8221; is the King James translation in middle English. The word used by God in Hebrew is to Murder, not kill. God was telling us not to Murder. Murder is to kill someone for personal gain or satisfaction as in a crime of passion or robbery.  War is not Murder.</p>

                        <p>Everyone is missing the point here. I have more respect for an atheist then a hypocrit first of all.  I used to be catholic and no longer am. If you say you are catholic and want that title then be a catholic period! Don&#8217;t say you are a member of an organization be it religion or political and not expect them to come down on you for not agreeing to the member rules.  You agreed to believe in your church&#8217;s view the minute you joined then go on in public about boasting on being catholic to get their votes. The catholic church has every right to come down on any member if you don&#8217;t agree with their core beliefs then leave as I did period, but to stay and pretend that you can be a public figure and think you  will  go uncriticized by your church is stupid, hypocritical and typical of our politicians.</p>

                        <p>People who try to equate abortion with war clearly have no understanding of Holy Scripture or the personality of the God of the Bible, and they likely don&#8217;t care.  The God of my Bible commanded Saul in I Samuel 15 commanded King Saul to go and slaughter the Amalekites&#8230;&#8221;This is what the LORD Almighty says: &#8216;I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. 3 Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, CHILDREN and INFANTS, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.&#8221;</p>
<p>The God of the Bible clearly states that the child in the womb is a living sould.  He also, throughout the Bible, authorized war and the killing of &#8220;innocent&#8221; people in the process.  Sarah Palin&#8217;s quote has been blantantly ripped out of context (like an aborted infant from the womb).  She prayed that we were doing God&#8217;s will in Iraq&#8230;in other words, asking God that he help us do the right thing.  Obviously, war should only be a last resort, and I&#8217;m not saying that all the reasons for going to his war in particular were correct.</p>
<p>I would like for someone in the pro-choice camp to give us some Scripture that would authorize abortion.  Some example where it happened in the Bible.</p>

<p>If life begins at conception, and you believe it, you have an obligation to fight for the life of those who can&#8217;t defend themselves.

                        <p>C.D. Walker, please study your Bible carefully and consult an authority.  The Bible does not condemn war outright. Have you read the Old Testament?  It&#8217;s filled with accounts of war, some more just than others. For those who disagree with war outright, I respect your beliefs, but do not misrepresent the Bible.  &#8220;Thou shalt not kill&#8221; is left slightly ambiguous in the English language, yet if we return to the original Hebrew, &#8220;thou shalt not murder&#8221; is a much more accurate translation.  Ask someone who speaks Hebrew.  Linguistically, there is a stark distinction between murder and war-motivated killing.  Yes, it&#8217;s very true that those who engage in unjust war will have to answer to the Judge.  No, war is not pleasant.  Notwithstanding, killing the innocent, those that have no voice, is quite different than engaging in conflict with the enemy.</p>

                        <p>Thankfully, our mothers didn&#8217;t kill us in the womb so we could live to debate the morality of killing others.  How unfortunate for the nearly 50 million people whose mothers did kill them in the womb that their voices will never be heard and their opinions never known.</p>

<p>When a person is pronounced dead it is because they do not have a heart beat. That said, a doctors ability to hear the heart beat of the baby in the mother at such an early stage in the pregnancy means&#8230;. It&#8217;s alive!</p>

                        <p>Thank you Catholic Church-even with all your recent troubles- for FINALLY climbing into the fight to preserve the life of the unborn in a forthright, public and understandable way. ABORTION IS MURDER-NO QUESTION. In no way can any so called legalization of abortion supersede the commandment &#8220;THOU SHALT NOT KILL&#8221;.<br />
The democratic party can talk all they want about women&#8217;s right to abortion but that cannot justify in any way the killing of the innocent unborn.</p>
<p>What has been  unleashed on all of humanity is a hideous evil that will ultimately destroy us all. And the democratic party is seeking a VOLUNTARY VOTE in the November elections to continue this second holocaust.</p>
<p>So far since Roe v Wade, 50,000,000 lives have been snuffed out. HOW LONG SHALL WE CONTINUE DOWN THIS ROAD?</p>
<p>GOD BLESS THE VATICAN!!</p>

                        <p>It&#8217;s amazing to see the defenders of abortion twist and gyrate to escape the simple point of the story: the Catholic Church condemns the killing of innocent an defenseless human life, and sometimes (not often enough, I think) rebukes those who publicly defend it.  It&#8217;s a simple position.  It&#8217;s not improper that any church should publicly explain its beliefs in the context of current events.</p>
<p>But those who think people should be permitted to kill their own children frequently say that people who oppose elective abortion should keep their mouths shut and not attempt to engage in the political process.  </p>
<p>The &#8220;shut up or else&#8221; argument indeed was frequently used by those who defended slavery, later, by those who defended Jim Crow laws&#8230; and later by Nazis, against those who opposed the Third Reich.  </p>
<p>Unborn children deserve to be included at the &#8220;table of human rights&#8221;.  They deserve protection and due process of law.  We who believe this must not let the opposition shout them down, no matter how loud or illogical.  We must persevere so that justice will prevail.</p>

                        <p>The good Archbishop failed to give equal time to the Republicans.  McCain is in favor of stem cell research and so the Republican party is equally guilty of bioethics violations in the eyes of the Catholic Church. The fact that the U.S.Bishops are particularly vocal this election should, however, give both parties pause to re-evaluate their positions on life issues.  At the end of the day it appears that it would be easier to educate the open mind of Barack Obama to amend his position on life issues than it would be to chang the mind of that stubborn old dog McCain, especially on his beloved war, which the Blessed John Paul II and Ratzinger opposed.</p>

<p>The younger generations have been given the green light by the liberal Democrats to have sex without any consequences, bombarding younger and younger children with sexual overtones in film and television programing to make sex acceptable practically at the kitchen table&#8230;this lack of responsibility to protect the young and destroy the fabric of the family is at the core of the Democratic Party.

                        <p>Abortion is a terrible practice, particularly when used as a form of birth control.</p>
<p>However, BOTH sides go to far on this issue.  Like most things, it isn&#8217;t black or white&#8230;but gray.  Pro-life wants no abortions by any means.  Pro-choice says free to do what they want.</p>
<p>They are BOTH wrong.</p>

                        <p>Good for him!!! It&#8217;s about time someone started pointing out the obvious. You can&#8217;t be a Christian and reject God&#8217;s Word.  You can&#8217;t profess to love Christ yet refuse repentance of personal sin. Christ was no government social reformer &#8211; although His love transforms personal lives. Jesus calls for repentance from personal sin &#8211; which abortion and homosexuality clearly are &#8211; if one simply reads the Bible.  Christ&#8217;s call is for changed lives, not for creation of leftist government policies.</p>

                        <p>People are missing the point.  The Catholic Church has the right to declare what they want, if you do not subscribe to those views, then leave that church&#8212;many have left for a variety of reasons.  It is the same as being part of PETA but then going out an clubbing baby seals to death.  You can not be &#8220;part&#8221; of a club &#8212; you are either for or against the central values.</p>

<p>As to the tax exempt status of the Church, the Constitution is clear.  Government will not interfere with religion.  The idea that religion has to remain quiet on government is crazy.  The whole purpose of religion is to lead its flock within the current system.  This is freedom of speech.  This is why we live here.</p>

                        <p>It is a tragedy that people do not understand that it is a fact as to when life begins (conception).  This is not disputed and is not a religious belief.  The only thing that can be considered &#8220;religious belief&#8221; is the morality of killing innocent life.  If you &#8220;believe&#8221; killing innocent life is wrong, then you must speak out against abortion.  </p>
<p>However, using the religious belief argument: The radical Muslims believe Jews are not human and gays are not human. Since this a religious belief they should have the right to abort them at any stage of their life.  After all we must have separation of church and state. Right?  Now I believe it is wrong to kill Jews and gays.  But I do not want to impose my religious belief on the poor Muslims of the world. So, Please don&#8217;t impose your belief system on the Muslims.  They should have the right to kill too &#8211; just like you.</p>

                        <p>The Catholic church is a safe house for pedophiles, and now they want to make a stink about abortion.  What a joke.  The bible is not, in any way, clear about when life begins, but they want to align themselves with the Republicans, who are in favor of the death penalty, invading a country by mistake (250,000 people dead), torturing prisoners, and ignoring science (stem cell research) which could save many lives.  Looks to me like the Catholic church has been in the death business too long.</p>

                        <p>&#8220;Palin believes that the war in Iraq is a task from God. Both John Paul II and Benedict have called the war in Iraq immoral and unjust. So, who do I beleive? A former Roman Catholic or the Pope?</p>
<p>&#8211; Posted by T. Kruger&#8221;</p>
<p>I spent 12 years in Catholic education where I studied St. Augustine at length.  St. Augustine is responsible for the church&#8217;s theological trajectory and he articulated a &#8216;just war&#8217; litmus.  Here&#8217;s a news flash: in the case of Iraq, St. Augustine&#8217;s just war criteria is more than satisfied on every level.  The modern church and both Popes can say what they want, but their position is based more on caring about public perception than substantive dogma.  Maybe they&#8217;re too busy heading off the next pedophile priest scandal or obstructing Federal immigration law to remember their St. Augustine?</p>

                        <p>I doubt a politician exists that agrees with their constituents on every nuance of every issue.  Sometimes voters have to swallow hard, prioritize the issues and make a judgment based on the entirety of a candidate&#8217;s position.  Abortion may well be murder, but so is unjust war.</p>

                        <p>The greatest danger to America today is right wing militarism. A philosophy that believes in preemptive war, torture, and that has elevated democracy to the level of religion. Although abortion is undoubtedly a great evil, war is the ultimate insanity unleashed by unstable minds. The kind of mind that unfortunately dominates the Republican party.</p>

                        <p>Really if these people cannot follow the religion they should not go around pretending they are part of the religion. They do all of this for prestige. Obama couldnt associate himself with his church so we dont Fellow democrats follow his lead?</p>

                        <p>Can someone please answer why this issue derives equal passion on both sides?  I understand that being pro-life, one would be passionate against the view that it is murder.  But why are people that are pro-choice apparantly equally passionate?  Is it that many have committed this act and therefore do not want to confront the guilt and therefore lash out at being equated as a murderer?  I sincerely dont understand.</p>

                        <p>The Catholic chruch joining hands with the right wing is really scary.  They are telling Catholics they must vote Republican based on this issue alone. Are they kidding look at the mess the world is in now because of their support for George Bush and the Republicans. They are going to send the world into a ditch.  Lets get real when in the histroy of the Republican party have they ever given a crap about poor babies. Remember this is the party that fought Roosevelt over child labor laws because they were taking the poor kids off the street and working them like slaves in their factories. Here is where the Republican support for abortions ends, tell them we are going to save all these poor babies and they will have to pay more taxes to help support them.  They will be dumping these babies off in the nearest trash cans themselves. Abortion is being used to manipulate votes that is the bottom line and the Catholic Church is falling for it. Money is what talks in the Republican party not life.</p>

                        <p>I keep seeing the statistic that 40-50 million babies have been aborted in the US since the legalization of abortion.<br />
I guess that stat is supposed to shock and awe me and change my mind from being pro-choice to anti-choice.</p>
<p>But that stat made me think, well how would the US look if all 40-50 million of those babies were born.</p>
<p>Unemployment would be 5 times worse than it is now and it is reaching all time highs. Social Security would be obsolete. The healthcare problem would have become a crisis.<br />
Deaths from illegal abortions would have increased tenfold. The economy would be horrendous as poor families struggle to support their children. Welfare would be draining from the economy an enormous amount of cash.</p>
<p>Upsides would include more troops to go and continue the US&#8217; history of slowly taking over the world. More parishoners to line the pockets of religions everywhere. </p>
<p>I totally understand why certain groups are so demanding on returning abortion to an illegal act now. It&#8217;s all wrapped up under the guise of &#8220;preventing murder&#8221;, but it&#8217;s really about money and furthering their own doctrine.</p>

All Muslims seem to do is kill people, each other included, over cartoons, books, minor disagreements, etc. They have promised to kill you, and you ignore it. I will give the Muslims credit, though, at least they&#8217;re honest &#8211; they call for your death, and doggone it, they mean it!</p>

                        <p>The constitution was thoughtfully crafted to protect the practices and views of religious and non-religious persons.  What has become recently known in the past forty-something years or so as the “separation of church and state” provides equal treatment under the law regardless of our religious bend or practice, while protecting the pursuit of the belief system of our choosing.   The view that morality that finds itself derived from a religious institution is somehow invalid in comparison to those derived from a secular institution is mystifying.  The constitution allows all groups to have legislative opinion and to critique any and all parts of the government .  No single group can make governmental  laws religious or secular, only the congress for and by the people can.  That being said, the American Arch-Bishop Burke has the same inaliable right to freedom of speech as we all do. He also has a responsibility to correct doctrinal err within public a public forum.  Whether any of us agree or disagree with his view is not germane to the discussion.</p>

                        <p>Look at all of you&#8230;this is the 2,000 year old Catholic church&#8230;the one that survived Rome, Byzantium, Ottoman Empire, Attila, and so on:<br />
1) What makes you think they are so wrong in denouncing your Democratic Party&#8211;actually specific people within that Party?<br />
2) Unlike your secular vision for the world, Catholics, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, animists, etc., see the world through the lens of their religions.  As you see they are plain wrong&#8211;they see you as plain wrong.<br />
3) That Church (the Catholic one) has had it&#8217;s share of problems&#8211;yet there is stands with it&#8217;s second-to-none avenue of helping the poor (note Mother Teresa) and shedding it&#8217;s blood in countless countries&#8211;something I don&#8217;t see Alec Baldwin and Nancy Pelosi doing (but they can sure tear down your country).<br />
4) It is quite amazing to the lengths that the world over has had to learn about the USA, yet all we see is your ability to tear one another up or find the next shiny object to paw at.  At least in most countries around our world, the deck may be stacked but the players are well known:  your election, for example, is in the bag by all parties, yet all are independent or whatever.  And yet, the Catholic Church is taking a beating.  Wow&#8230;.</p>

                        <p>Abortion and capital punishment are not the same before God. It&#8217;s murder of the innocent (which God forbids) vs. killing the guilty (which God commands.) God endorses capital punishment in the NT saying &#8220;rulers do not bear the sword in vain &#8211; but for the punishment of evildoers&#8221;). Liberals always errantly compare the two to justify this evil.</p>

                        <p>The narrators of this site did not want to post my comments about Planned Parenthood and its founder Margaret Sanger.<br />
So folks, please do a Google search yourself folks or go into a library and find out yourself what she wrote in her book how she envisioned aborting the black race out of existence, a la Hitler vis a vis the Jewish people.<br />
And consider how Democrats including Barack Obama, himself African American, take campaign contributions from Planned Parenthood. </p>
<p>Human life starts at conception. Already with all its characteristics of specific Gnomes as a full grown person. Science says so. So don&#8217;t come with that &#8220;it ism not a baby&#8221; nonsence. Look at the pictures these days of 3 week olds in the womb sucking it thumb! </p>
<p>And no, a fetus (Latin for &#8220;little child&#8221;) is NOT part of the woman&#8217;s body like an arm and a leg. Only connected to a small cord for depending on the mother for nutrition.<br />
And even if she wanted to have her -normal, healthy, arm or leg amputated would we not try to talk her out of it?<br />
How much more so when it involves a baby!</p>
<p>Estimates are that almost 1 million babies are aborted each year.<br />
This, while almost the same number of infertile couples spend a fortune eagerly trying to adopt a baby.<br />
Is GOD trying to tell us something, you think?</p>

Never in the history of the republican party have they given a crap about poor dead babies.  It is a ploy to manipulate the hillbilly vote. In the end ask any Republican if they would be willing to pay more taxes to support all these poor babies they are going to save. That will be the end of their prolife views. What the Republicans really care about is their money not poor babies.  Huh, the whole thing is laughable.</p>

There are ample examples in the old and new testaments which affirm that the civil government has the right to wield the sword, not just in war but for capital punishment.  The Roman Catholic Church&#8217;s positions on war and capital punishment are not in line with biblical precepts.</p>

The Democrats are the party of death, but they market it in a wayt to make it all sound nice and pleasant.  Abortion is censored as well.  Maybe we need to have &#8220;Choice Awareness&#8221; week at public schools and show videos of abortions in progress.  Or should we continue the censorship?</p>

<p>The phrase has such a great ring to it – for journalists, that is. It&#8217;s hot, punchy (with that double-p alliteration) and short enough for headlines. All in all, a great tag for summing up one of the most sensational news stories of the year. </p>
<p>The only problem is – it&#8217;s a lie. </p>
<p>It turns out the vast majority of the Catholic priests&#8217; offenses do not involve &#8220;pedophilia&#8221; – sexual contact between an adult and a pre-pubescent youth. Rather, they amount to sexual seductions of teen-age boys by predatory homosexual men who have abused their position of authority and trust. </p>
<p>Funny how those that complain about gay priests molesting boys also want more gays to be Boy Scout leaders as well.  The problem isn&#8217;t that they are priests, but that they are gay. How about banning gays from the Priesthood?   No wonder the Boy Scouts don&#8217;t want to be forced to have gays as Scout leaders. Who wants the same problem?  And then if gay scout leaders started molesting young scouts the liberals would start criticizing the Boy Scouts as a corrupt organization.  What a joke.</p>

                        <p>&#8220;I am glad to see that the Church is beginning to take a bolder stand for the rights of the unborn.  The American people are stupid to think that all aspects of American culture are not affected by poor moral choices.  (For instance, Social Security is directly affected by abortion!  Do the simple math&#8230;</p>
<p>Women do have a choice, the choice to not have sex outside the confine of marriage.  As a teacher for 30+ years I cannot think of a sigle student that should have been aborted.  All are special in unique ways!</p>
<p>I would hope that the Church would begin to be even more vocal about what use to be a strong Democratic Party here in the U.S.  I abandoned the party several years ago because of the moral depravity they are pursuing.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>Look, this is not an issue.  For Catholic, while the war, hunger, Gay Marriage, the poor, are important issue, the preeminate issue is ABORTION.  We have candidate who publicly support abortion.  What the Catholic Church is saying is that if you are going to be Catholic you can&#8217;t support ABORTION.  Pick&#8230;Catholic or Abortion.  You can support both.</p>

                        <p>In one respect the Catholic church is correct to state its clear position regarding politicians who claim themselves as Catholics, and then differ fundamentally on the church&#8217;s issues. But to what extent do politicians differ from the church. Biden has the same view. Also Pelosi. They just state that the legislation of a state should be &#8216;hands-off&#8217; for any organized religion. The State, any state, should be hands off for an entity, that once was a formidable political entity itself. The Catholic church, if the US credibility in the world today is being challenged, lost it &#8216;sense-of-purpose&#8217; for many millions a long time ago.</p>

Maybe even throw in Pol Pot (2-3 mil). But there is no argument, both Hitler and Stalin where Ruthless and Blood letting rulers of Nations, where the people of those nations were just too frightened to do anything about it. We ALL know how they have been judged. That would probably make USA and Europe the perpetrators of the most heinous elimination of the most defenseless human beings on the planet, and the democrats and lefties both here and abroad own it. 48,589,993 They were killed because they were inconvenient. So, hearing any bullshit trying to defend abortion is worse than insane, you just go ahead and placate your conscience; you will not escape judgment.</p>

                        <p>Following up on Luke, I think that it is absurd not to support a politician because you disagree with ONE of their beliefs.  What about all of the other policies that the candidate has?  Is abortion really the most important issue when the economy is struggling in epic proportions?  To let your religion get in the way of the success of America is absurd.  Selecting a leader is a culmination of MANY things, and separation of church and state is a must.  Are you really not going to support a leader because he/she votes for abortion?  REALLY?  What about everything else.  Why is ABORTION the most important thing to look at during the voting process?  Is it because it is tied to your religion?  Many people above have stated that they would never support a candidate who supports pro choice.  That&#8217;s it?  What about their plan to fix the economy, their plan on Iraq, their plan to free us of fuel dependency.  Please, for one minute, take your religious views out the door, and focus on what matters, the Unite States, not yourself.  You go to church for a reason.</p>

                        <p>Good Christians have waited for exactly this type of pro-active attempt to stop the hypocrisy. Yes, the Church has been attacked from within by horrible people. It is NOT what Christ created, and worrying about the whiplash of excommunications has allowed the evil to grow. But now that it is finally being addressed, don&#8217;t accuse all of us who know &#8220;the gates of Hell shall not prevail against us&#8221;. I am a Catholic, and I&#8217;m not alone in trying to live my Faith as it was handed down by Christ.</p>

                        <p>When we compare war and abortion and say that they are equally evil we make a huge mistake.  </p>
<p>During the American Civil War hundreds of thousands gave their lives and over a million were maimed in order to uphold the &#8220;inalienable&#8221; right to Liberty.  I don&#8217;t hear anyone now saying that was a wrong war or that it should not have taken place.  </p>
<p>LIFE is another and more BASIC &#8220;inalienable” right.   Not speaking against it we become complicit in its evil and our own hands become soiled with the blood of the “innocent” who are being slaughtered daily right in their own mothers&#8217; wombs.  </p>
<p>Why have we hardened our hearts to the plight of the most innocent and defenseless in our society?  Are we silent or indifferent only because we can’t hear their cry?  They do cry and their blood cries out to God.</p>

                        <p>Zionist? What? Ahmadinejad has openly declared that Israel must be destroyed. Besides, isn&#8217;t Zionist sort of anti-semetic? I suppose now African Americans are going to take over the world too and &#8220;kill whitey?&#8221; Or maybe those darn irish people will flood the world with beer and end all civilization.

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see.</p>
<p>The Republican party’s willingness to wage *nuclear* warfare against Iran in violation of Iran’s legal right to pursue uranium enrichment for peaceful purposes (and based upon the Zionist calumny that Ahmadinejad has stated that the Israel ’should be removed from the map’) signifies that the Republican party is the party of LIFE.</p>

                        <p>I haven&#8217;t read all the comments completely, but I would ask each side to be respectful of the other. After all, Joe Biden said in the debate last night that he respected the motives of all people, even those he disagreed with.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church has consistently opposed abortion. The debate about the beginning of life is a biological debate; even before science proved that life begins at conception, the Church opposed abortion. If you believe that abortion is the taking of an innocent life, are you not obliged to stand for life? Some people believed that black people from Africa were not human. Did the liberals of the day say, &#8220;I believe that they are human, but I won&#8217;t interfere with your right to have slaves.&#8221; No. They opposed slavery and imposed their will on others.</p>
<p>What kind of person believes that innocent children are being slaughtered but refuses to speak up? A person who is afraid. A person misled by the false values of our society. A person who can not tell the difference between beliefs that are strictly religious and beliefs that derive from the laws of nature and of Nature&#8217;s God. (See the Declaration of Independence.) I feel sorry for Joe Biden. He is confused and perhaps fearful of standing for truth.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s pray for those who can&#8217;t see the truth &#8212; that their eyes will be opened.</p>

                        <p>Why doesn&#8217;t the Catholic Church mind its own business.  The clergy can&#8217;t even say a mass the same way from one parish to another, state to state, country to country, just one of the messes they have created.  Archbishop Burke needs to watch his comments.  They are not very appropriate despite his beliefs.  I suggest the church, since it is anti-abortion, agree to pay for all of the children who are born rather than aborted.  Are they willing to do that?  If every woman agrees to have their child, will the church pay for its care for life?  Until they are ready to do this, then they need to stick with cleaning up their own internal messes.</p>

                        <p>It&#8217;s quite ironic how democrats are open to abortion but opposed to the death penalty. From the outside looking in, it looks like they&#8217;ve already sentenced these innocent children to death for a crime they didn&#8217;t commit. I would much rather put to death an accused criminal rather than an unborn baby. I choose life, therefore I choose the Republican Party.</p>

                        <p>I wonder what would happen if an active pro-abortionist doctor dies, and stands before the Creator. And the Creator says to him:&#8221; You are not deaf, nor blind nor illiterate nor dyslexic. So, tell me why you thought killing unborn babies is fine? My bible is very clear that its wrong, My commandments too, and all of the ministers too?&#8221;<br />
The culprit, a Dem, can be expected to try to avoid culpability; Pelosi said so, or Reid, womens rights etc etc.<br />
The Creator would give short shrift to such lame excuses. &#8220;So you rate Pelosi etc on a par with me? I don&#8217;t think so! I&#8217;ll deal with them in due course. As for women&#8217;s rights, I sent the babies. My wishes override any human rights. Right now, its you on trial. You&#8217;ve committed the cardinal sin of the coldblooded murder of innocent babies. Not once, but repeatedly.  For that you have to go downstairs for eternity, I&#8217;m sorry to say. Take him down!&#8221; Interesting.<br />

                        <p>Well, the Vatican Officials &#8220;hit the nail directly on the head&#8221; when they deemed the US Democratic Party as the Party of Death!  </p>
<p>It is one thing to quietly believe in the right to kill the unborn without condescension to alternate opinions/beliefs.  However, to overtly spew condemnation, rant, rave and begrudge the life of a little baby boy because the US VP Candidate chose &#8220;Life&#8221; for her &#8220;Downs Syndrome Baby&#8221; is the most wicked, vile, despicable, loathsome attitude known to man. </p>
<p>This little boy is no threat nor burden to these demented Democrats.  The fact that they would deny him &#8220;LIFE&#8221; post &#8220;BIRTH&#8221; is the lowest form of mental  criminality.  </p>
<p>GET THIS&#8230;&#8230;..Unfortunately, this little baby boy will grow up only to eventually read that these extreme, mental indigents regarded his life superfluous, thus, felt he should never have had the chance to live at all!!!  WHO and WHAT are you vicious freaks???  May God forgive you all!</p>
<p>Amen to the Vatican Officials and their intuitive insight into the venomous mentality of the US Democrat.</p>

                        <p>Abortion IS being singled out as the greatest evil of this time&#8230;and for good reason. In this country alone, almost 50,000,000 (50 million) future citizen&#8217;s lives have been terminated before they have had a chance to choose for themselves. Worldwide, the numbers approach the 1,000,000,000 (billion) mark. This is an evil beyond imagination! </p>
<p>This does not sanction war, poverty, crime, the death penalty&#8230;etc. They are also great evils&#8230;however, if taken in their totality do not compare to the evil of abortion. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s spend the money being utilized to snuff the innocent on the women who feel they don&#8217;t have a choice and provide them with a happier option than feeling their &#8216;only way out&#8217; is to kill their unborn baby.</p>

                        <p>The comment &#8220;Regardless of one’s religious views on abortion, it is unethical to legislate your religion on others.&#8221; is a ill-conceived (s&#8217;cuze the pun) idea.<br />
This is not &#8216;unethical.&#8217;<br />
Every law is &#8216;religious&#8217; in that it imposes a penalty based upon a set of values/views/beliefs that a group of people have about right or wrong.<br />
Rather than describing this as &#8216;unethical&#8217; you might simply state your belief that abortion does not really kill a living human. That would be better than hiding behind the false argument of religious legislation.</p>

I would never ever have an abortion and hope no one else does because it is against God.  But God gave us a choice, free will.  He allows us to choose.  We glorify God by making the right choices.  To disallow choice doesn&#8217;t make us better people, we would be unable to do the right thing in the face of a choice between right and wrong.  We would not be able to glorify God.</p>

                        <p>For more than fifty years of my adult life, I have been an Evangelical Christian.   My relationship with the Lord had guided my life.  Despite my heartfelt and often-stated objections to abortion and homosexuality, my Christian beliefs were challenged because I was a Democrat.  I have had statements made to me such as “come out from among them: or “you can&#8217;t be like Christ and be a Democrat”.  I realize than many Godly pastors and Bible teachers with good intentions and true sincerity have held ferociously to their beliefs about Democrats for years.  Some have pounded the pulpit claiming that abortions in the United States started through actions by the Democrat Party.  This offends me greatly because it is simply not true.  I have never questioned anyone&#8217;s own personal Christian relationship because of where they worship or their political leanings.  Now, for Democrats like myself who are also Evangelicals, it is time to set the record straight.</p>
<p>A 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe V. Wade, legalized abortion by a 7-2 vote.  Six of the seven Justices in the majority were Republican appointees.  The only Democrat appointee, Byron White, voted against Roe V. Wade.  </p>
<p>In fact, in every year since 1969, the United States Supreme Court has been controlled by a majority of Republican-appointed judges.  There has not been a Democrat-appointed Chief Justice since 1953.   </p>
<p>Currently, there are seven Republican appointees and two nominated by Democrats. Obviously, If the Republican majority has wanted to overturn Roe V. Wade at any time since 1973, the had the votes to do so.  Why haven&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>In 2003, the United States Supreme Court in Lawrence V. Texas overturned a Texas law against sodomy.  Once again, in the 6-3 decision, four Republicans voted to overturn the law.</p>
<p>Recently, the California Supreme Court overturned the State&#8217;s ban on same sex marriage.  Six of the seven California judges were elected Republicans.</p>
<p>From 2000-2006, Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the Presidency.  In 2006, the FDA approved an “over the counter” abortion drug known as “Plan B”.  The head of the FDA serves at the pleasure of President Bush.</p>
<p>My point is clear.   For religious leaders to continue to blame Democrats for Republican actions is wrong.</p>

                        <p>I am sick of reading that no one has the right to impose their religious or moral view on others. If one follows this line of reasoning then upon what moral basis does one rely for denying advocates of depraved practices (such as bestiality, cannibalism, sex with children, female circumcision, etc.)?<br />
There are moral absolutes. There is right &amp; wrong, there is truth and falsehood. Choose to rely upon the truth proclaimed by the God of the universe in the bible and earnestly seek His will and your confusion will cease.</p>

                        <p>Abortion can never be justified, because it is the direct intentional killing of an innocent person.  </p>
<p>War can be justified, say for example in defense.  Note that the Church did not consider either the Gulf War or the Iraq War as necessarily justified.  In war, to maintain justice, you must never iintentionally kill innocent bystanders.  This is the same as in the case of police activity: sometimes bystanders get hurt.  But that must never be the intention.  This is also why it is never  allowed to kill ordinary prisoners of war.</p>
<p>In an abortion, the doctor actually intends the death of the child, and tears his/her body limb from limb, without anaesthesia.  </p>
<p>That is the difference between war and abortion.  In war innocent people may die accidentally, while in an abortion an innocent person is targeted for destruction.  Soldiers can be good, although some may not be.  Abortionists cannot be good.</p>
<p>The Church&#8217;s teaching is very clear and concise and, I think, very convincing.</p>

This tells us that your life is planned before conception. So if you vote Democrat it is simple, you keep in power the people that have passed laws saying that Murder is ok. And Obama is the worst of the worst. He voted to make sure that no medical help would be ok if the abortion was batched and the life was outside the mom.</p>

                        <p>In response to Dave&#8217;s point, &#8220;Each person has a freedom of choice, and the decision a pregnant woman has to struggle with about either having the baby or having an abortion, or giving it up to adoption, or etc. that choice is hers and hers alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you agree that there is a difference between &#8220;choice&#8221; and &#8220;right?&#8221; I have a choice to kill the next person who comes in the room. Does that mean I have the right as well? </p>
<p>In the end, I think our country&#8217;s notion of freedom has changed from being free to do the right thing to being free to do whatever you want.</p>

                        <p>The Church has condemned the current wars that the US is waging. Therefore they are not being hypocritical. Also, the Church does state that some wars are OK if they are necessary to prevent evil(WWII for example). Killing innocent babies is never justified, and misrepresenting this position is a terrible thing.<br />

                        <p>For the record, I&#8217;m not Catholic, but I think John Paul II was right on the money when he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Holy See insistently proclaims that the first and most fundamental of all human rights is the right to life, and that when this right is denied all other rights are threatened. The assumption that abortion and euthanasia are human rights deserving legislative sanction is seen by the Holy See as a contradiction which amounts to a denial of the human dignity and freedom which the law is supposed to protect. A society will be judged on the basis of how it treats its weakest members; and among the most vulnerable are surely the unborn and the dying. A materialistic view of the human person will concede little value and dignity to either. What is then claimed as a victory for human rights is really the sanctioning of a freedom sundered from truth. In the end, that is no freedom at all but a descent into arbitrariness and the dominion of the strong over the weak.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>May we all recognize that through the saving grace of our Lord Jesus Christ we are forgiven.  I think all of us should look in the mirror and recognize that we are sinful.  The Lord commands us to rebuke sin.  The Bible is filled with recognition of life at conception.  The Lord knows us, we are born in sin and that includes our politicians.  We need to pray for them and ask the Lord to turn them from the sin of abortion.  If they don&#8217;t, they will stand before the Almighty and have to given an account as to why they did not believe in God&#8217;s word and follow his commands.  If they don&#8217;t repent and confess Jesus as Lord then they will be doomed to everlasting destruction.  I pray that we all heed the warnings of Jesus and come to Him.  I suggest that you read Romans and learn from it &#8211; God speaks to us &#8211; all of us people in authority and under authority.  Woe to those who dismiss the God of the Bible and refuse to believe in his authority as sovereign Lord!</p>

                        <p>It&#8217;s funny how the Catholic Church does not say how Republicans are FOR Capital Punishment! A life is a life and nobody is &#8220;for&#8221; abortion but in time of rape, incest, or the mother&#8217;s life is on the line they may be a need for it.  Also if abortion is made illegal in the States backshops with unlicensed or revoked licensed doctors would be endangering our wives and daughters for unsafe medical procedures.  I am all for trying to keep a child but there should be more counseling and adoptions to help women make a very, very difficult decision. Finally, to all the expected posters that would say well an unborn child is innocent whereas a death row inmate is guilty, remember there are many on death row wrongly imprisoned, an unwanted born child has a higher risk to committing crimes. If you are pro-life who are you to decide on who lives or dies, by the very statement that you are pro-life you are therefore for ALL life, otherwise you are playing God in who lives and dies!</p>

                        <p>There is no question that life, a totally separate life, begins at the moment of fertilization; or rather, mitosis commences. At that point, an organism with completely unique DNA exists and is replicating. Do deny that it is alive is contrary to fact. The question is, does the organism have a human soul at this point, not is it alive… This can be argued any number of ways, but abortionist liberals err by not choosing the action that exterminates humanity (if it exists) rather than preserves humanity (if it exists). Of course, liberals are largely atheistic anyway, which is their true justification for discarding human life – they do not acknowledge any soul or spark of divinity within humans. Which, finally, explains why liberals have such a significantly lower self-image than conservatives do. They consider themselves (and everyone else) essentially valueless. This is why liberalism, the modern face of socialism, is such a base and disgusting philosophy; it is, as the Bishop says, a philosophy of death.</p>

                        <p>For all those that are pro-choice, do you agree that 1. If a woman that is pregnant, and she chooses to smoke drugs during pregnancy and deliver a crack baby, that society should say nothing, after all its her body?  2. If someone decides to kick a pregnant women in the belly until the fetus is dead, is that also just the womans body and therefore the equivalent of kicking her in the leg?   I believe that the pro-choice position, is not only wrong morally, but also illogical.  Kudos to the Catholic church!</p>

It&#8217;s just too bad that the Vatican doesn&#8217;t speak out about the pervasive spread of socialism (the bailout) in the U.S., which is nearly as damaging as the lack of regard for human life.  Maybe when the economy gets bad enough and their donations dry up, they will realize that it is the free market that is the most moral economic plan.</p>

I use to be a democrate and I left the party because of their support for homosexuality, and late term abortion.  People have a choice when they are having sex, and they should use protection, and that way they can stop unwanted pregnancies before conception.  Democrates think they are above God and Country but they are not.  Judgement will come to them sometime.<br />

                        <p>I cannot believe that anyone tries to justify abortion &#8211; there is no justification.  Do not make the mistake of bringing in anything else about war, or what the Church has done in the past &#8211; it does not matter &#8211; 2 wrongs do not make a right.  Abortion is still wrong &#8211; period.  A women does not have a choice &#8211; God places a soul in a baby upon conception, who are we to interfere? How can anyone abort a child &#8211; why, because it is not convenient, timing is wrong?  There are so many who want to adopt, give the baby a chance at life.  Who will stand up for the rights of Baby&#8217;s?  Pro-life does.<br />
I am proud to be a Catholic &#8211; here is a church that is taking a stand.  Has the Church made mistakes &#8211; yes.  Does that mean that it cannot stand up and take a stand against Abortion &#8211; NO!</p>

                        <p>Bishops are right. Christianity protects life and forbids murder. You either have pie or eat pie, you are either a Christian and protect innocent life or you murder for your own convenience in which case you are not a Christian.</p>

                        <p>I applaud the Archbishop for his stand against what Pelosi and Biden have stated. But what good does it do when these people are so high up in the government that they dare not change their position on anything. That would require being humble and that is not in either one of them. Minus some conservative Democrats, the Democratic Party IS the party of death. Look what they&#8217;ve done to our economy with this scam bailout. There wasn&#8217;t any need for a bailout. What is was, was the representatives who&#8217;ve blocked regulations on Freddie/Fannie wouldn&#8217;t do anything about these two failures until they were bankrupt. Democrats and management in general cannot allow themselves to admit fault or that what they said do was a bad idea and it caused a failure. The higher up the ranks a person goes the less they can admit fault. Until they finally reach the top of their profession where the damage they cause by not being able to admit fault causes the loss of livlyhoods for thousands of people under their control. The church has always taught being humble is not to be feared, and will not cause loss of respect from people. But evil teaches these people in high positions, that if they admit fault they cannot stay aloft above the people you control. Admitting fault makes people equal and people in high positions believe they are not equal with anyone except those in the same position they are in, and even then some will pick apart what those equal to them do and say trying to make them look bad and themselves good. To us those that do that are bad as well, but they do not believe that about themselves only about others. Archbishop Burke puts it right in that taking a position supporting abortion is wrong, and when these people who&#8217;ve made their careers passing the blame onto others, don&#8217;t face the facts about killing the unborn as murder but rather attack those who state that, are in danger of damnation. The story of Jesus&#8217; life tells us that when he was at a town and the children came running up to Him, the adults tried to shoo them away. Jesus said not to do that, but to &#8220;suffer the little children to come unto me, for those who deny me to them, I will deny you to my Father.&#8221; Pelosi and Biden need that read to them, for if you kill the little children, you do that unto him who is the Father. The Democrats need a serious humbling to take place. Their hearts may be in somewhat of a good place about wanting to take care of those who can&#8217;t take care of themselves, but when they promote abortion as a way to lighten the burden on the poor, is not only ignorant, but influencing people to commit sin themselves as those who talk them into sinning.</p>

                        <p>It seems the angry left misses three points:  </p>
<p>One, the Bishop did not say the Republicans were an approved party by the Catholic church.  He was speaking to several specific positions that the Democratic Party supports.  If you recall the Catholic church has been repeatedly critical of the Bush adminisration for the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>Two: To read the commandment &#8220;thou shalt not kill&#8230;&#8221; in it&#8217;s original language you will find that it says more accurately &#8220;Commit no murder&#8221; a very specific reference to premeditated murder.  After the commandments were given God told Israel to go to war.  It&#8217;s one thing to quote a verse (in English).  It&#8217;s another thing to UNDERSTAND what it means.</p>
<p>Three: The scripture &#8220;Judge not&#8230;&#8221; refers to pronouncing a person damned to hell.  We are called to mercy, but we are not called to ignor evil and sin.  You&#8217;re allowed to point out someones sins so that they might repent of them.  Lord knows we all have them, so don&#8217;t get so angry when someone points them out.  If someone says &#8220;go to hell&#8221; well that&#8217;s another story.  That is what the &#8220;judge not&#8221; scripture is addressing.</p>

                        <p>It is a fact that George Washington died a Catholic. It is a fact that Washington was a advocatestudent in the writings of St. Robert Bellarnine and St. Thomas Aquinas (Catholic Saints), specifically on political philosophy. It is a fact George Washington, James Madison, and other &#8220;Founding Fathers&#8221; used the ideasconcepts of these &#8220;religious people&#8221; to form this great republic. Thomas Jefferson included concepts of these Saints in the writing of Declaration of Independence. It is a fact that George Washington had a bible in his possession when on the Senate Floor. It is a fact that the President of the United States is sworn into the office with his hand on a bible. It is a fact that this country that you love so much is built on the foundation of religious ideas. If you remove them, the foundation will eventually fall. I love my country and I love my religion (Catholic). You can&#8217;t define good and evil without it. Abortion is evil. PERIOD. It is a fact that George Washington loved this country and would not believe how backwards it has became, and that is the facts. So for all you pro-abortion advocates and atheist&#8230;Stick that in your pipe and smoke it.</p>

                        <p>Archbishop Burke, like so many in the Church Hierarchy, ignores the Churches own teachings when it comes to the definition of pro-life. Pope John Paul II stated that, and this is not exact as I did not look it up, to be pro-life one must reject the violence of abortion. One must reject the violence of the death penalty. One must reject the violence of poverty. </p>
<p>He was quite eloquent on it. The bottom line is that the Republican Party is no more pro-life than the Democrats, they are just anti-abortion. Both parties have a long way to go. Executing prisoners and dropping cluster bombs and missals on villages is taking life as surely as abortion.</p>
<p>The Church needs to stay out of politics and try and re-establish the moral authority it squandered in scandal. This is not helpful.</p>

You write: &#8220;and based upon the Zionist calumny that Ahmadinejad has stated that the Israel ’should be removed from the map&#8221;. Are you for real? The &#8220;Zionist calumny&#8221;? So you&#8217;re telling me that Israel made up Ahmadinejad&#8217;s comments about wiping Israel off the map? He&#8217;s on record saying that himself! Go look it up. It&#8217;s an undeniable fact.<br />
And, in regard to Republicans being the party of LIFE. That is absolutely true. The fact that republicans want to defend the United States against a real, demonstrable threat, one that has already claimed nearly 3,000 lives in a single attack alone, does not negate their position on defending life. The difference is, in general, the philosophy of conservatives is to defend innocent life while the philosophy of liberals is to defend the guilty, the depraved and the immoral, though of course, they would never admit it.</p>

                        <p>&#8220;Thou shall not murder&#8221; is what the word used in Hebrew means, not kill.  Are you truly trying to say there is no difference between a soldier killing to defend his country, and a &#8216;doctor&#8217; and woman aborting an innocent baby?  Even if a soldier accidentally kills a baby in a battle, there is a difference, because of intent.  Abortion is a targeted killing of an innocent baby.  Very similar to a terrrorist&#8217;s targeting of innocent children.  Of course, I notice that those who support abortion, also tend to put a moral equivalence on terrorists, so it doesn&#8217;t surprise me that you would try to call American soldiers murderers, while never admitting that an abortion has killed a human being.  You are doing the will of our enemies, Osama himself couldn&#8217;t hope to murder 30 million American children, yet we have done it to ourselves with abortions, all supported by fellow travelers of those who hate this country.</p>

And this is yet one more example.  When it comes time to make an accounting for abortion in society as the Germans had to for their war against the Jews, will anyone remember our voices?  That we did cry out for the innocent and helpless victims of abortion?</p>

                        <p>I applaud the Catholic Church for speaking up to protect innocent life.  When our political leaders, and pseudo Catholic leaders, seek to mislead and flat our lie, the Church must stand up and set the record straight.  This is not politics by the Church, but standing up for the principles it believes in, especially when others seek to distort them.  For those who criticize the Church, so be it, enjoy.  However, that does not take away from the fact that the Church should be, and properly is, standing up for the rights of innocent, unborn life.  Thank you Catholic Church, and we along with other Christians (and Jews) will do our part to support unborn, innocent life come election day!</p>

                        <p>Archbishop Burke should be Pope, so that we can have outspoken leadership on important moral issues. Pope Benedict seems to be a great guy, but I don&#8217;t see strong, outspoken leadership emanating from him on this issue and many others. Why are most of the American Bishops silent? Where is their leadership? The only issue that I hear them leading on is encouraging people to violate the immigration laws of the United States of America. And why do most of them seem inclined to favor the immoral, socialistic, Democrat &#8220;party of death&#8221;?</p>

                 <div class="commentsBody">
                        <p>A few quick (hopefully) points:</p>
<p>1)  The term &#8220;Catholic&#8221; means universal.  Universal means everywhere and throughout time.  Therefore, the Catholic Church is going to maintain a consistent set of beliefs.  Many people on this thread are going to spout off a number of errant statements of how the Church has changed its doctrines.  Fine, but history has ways of being contorted by its current authors (Howard Zinn, anyone?).  The Church has always maintained the evil of any abortion, and has always taught the virtue of chastity.  A Catholic who disagrees with the Church on the issues of abortion and chastity has therefore broken with the consistent teaching of the Church.  They therefore cease to be Catholic and cannot recieve the Eucharist.  With repentance and penance, they can enter back into the fold.</p>
<p>2)  The role of a Bishop is to be the chief teacher of the faith in a particular locality.  In this capacity, a Bishop has the duty to correct and warn those under his care of their spiritual state: to do so is considered an act of Spiritual Mercy.  When a prominent person publically mis-represents the faith, it is the Bishop&#8217;s duty to correct them.  Likewise, when a person associated with a particular organization (say a sports team) speaks incorrectly, their supervisor must correct them.  That is how it works.</p>
<p>3)  The Democratic Party is mentioned simply for two reasons: both its primary candidates are ardent supporters of abortion and embryonic stem-cell research, and during its Convention, it modified its platform from having abortion be safe, legal, and rare, to being safe and legal.  Plus, its primary spokesman had taken public steps to ensure that he not only supported all abortion, but he would also allow an innocent baby who survived abortion to be killed merely because that baby represented a threat to abortion. Thus, the party publically established itself in stark contrast with the teachings of the Church.</p>
<p>4) The Church has the right to preach on moral issues during an election year and still remain tax exempt.  Religious institutions are allowed to preach on the various issues, inform people of candidate&#8217;s stances on the issues, register voters, and encourage people to vote.  The Catholic Church has never endorsed (nor ardently opposed) any specific candidate by name.  Archbishop Burke&#8217;s comments were actually quite legal: he never endorsed any candidate (nor does he oppose Obama in his comment).  Quite simply, he states the truth that in relation to Church teaching, the Democratic party is moving considerably farther away from respecting and promoting life.</p>

<p>I understand your anger at the wrongs committed by the church in the past.  Does this really undermine the Truth that the church represents though?  Can the faults of human beings ever truly damage the perfection of creation?<br />

                        <p>Thank you, Archbishop Burke, for standing up for truth.  No other argument or issue matters if we do not have the opportunity to take that first breath once we have been conceived.  He is not &#8220;imposing his religion:&#8221;  he is PROPOSING truth. We must stand up for &#8220;the least of our brethren,&#8221; those who have no chance to speak for themselves.  Those who believe otherwise have lost their way, and since those words are in the Democratic platform, they deserve each other:  the lost and the Democrats.</p>

                        <p>Regrettably, today politicians from both parties, such as Nancy Pelosi, Joe Bidden, Rudy Giuliani, Ed Kennedy, Newt Gingrich, John Kerry, and many others claim to be Catholics, when in fact by their actions they live outside of the Catholic Church. We shouldn’t expect that church would change just to accommodate us. It looks rather that politicians want to use religion for political gains. Barrack Obama obviously chose Joe Bidden, as his running mate to influence Catholic vote. In reality, that action did not produce effect he desired. In US, unlike Saudi Arabia, Pakistan or Iran we live in the society, with many religions flourishing in harmony, therefore we have almost unlimited choices, and we may pick religion that fits our beliefs and values.</p>

                        <p>I am a convert and to this day I have never understood how people can criticize any church, let alone the Catholic Church, which is the oldest, and that almost all other christain churches, have things in their liturgy and creed taken from the Catholic Church. To blaspheme against any Christain church is unforgiveable.  All of you  who have put forth your criticism with such vehemence, obviously know absolutely nothing about the church, its history, or its teaching! It is made of human beings, just like you and me. Human beings make all kinds of mistakes and often err, so why would you think that the Catholic Church or any other church would not make mistakes, especially when it goes back to the 1st century?  It seems to me that a lot of you have nothing else to do but spew out rotten rhetoric, which is harmful to you and to anyone else who reads it! It is a terrible thing to be so hateful and infect everyone else with it!  The bishops and the priests teach us to pray for people like you. I will try, but it is very difficult, especially when you seem to think that it is okay to murder a helpless small human with every physical attribute that you, yourself have. As far as having a Downs Syndrome child I have known them to be very loving,<br />
and capable of much more than people often think they are. To most families who have chosen to have them, they are a blessing!</p>

                        <p>Michael Cecil, how informed you are! You muist have the inside information about US govt. plans to &#8220;wage nuclear war&#8221; against Iran, since no such plan has ever been proposed or articulated by the Bush administration! Or were you just making that up? And just because the Iranians, the world&#8217;s foremost state sponsors of international terroroism, who have all the energy resources they need without nuclear power are enriching uranium to weapons grade, and vowing to wipe Israel off the map, that&#8217;s no reason for US intervene in their &#8220;right&#8221; to develop nuclear technology, right? Given that Iran is a terrorist theocracy bent on destroying the only relaible ally the US has in that region of the world, and the &#8220;Obama-ssiah&#8221; would sit down and negotiate with these thugs and murderers without preconditions, then that makes the Dumbo-craps some kind of party of LIFE? Give it up jerk! You must be as stupid as you sound!</p>

                        <p>I am a Catholic and I am pro-life.  My thoughts are this:</p>
<p>Even though it is legal to have an abortion, it does NOT MANDATE that a woman have an abortion.  Do you see the difference?  It&#8217;s free will.  </p>
<p>I believe it is our responsibility as Americans, as Christians, as Catholics to educate people the best we can.  Knowlegde is power.  </p>
<p>I agree with the ones who wrote about God giving us free will.  He will judge us.  I agree with the ones who wrote there needs to be better support systems out there for these woman if we are going to make abortion illegal. </p>
<p>To some degree it doesn&#8217;t matter if abortion is made illegal or stays legal because either way, abortions will still happen.  Murder still happens even though it&#8217;s illegal.  Drug&#8217;s still happen even through they are illegal and so on.  We need to keep straight what are GOD&#8217;s laws and what are man made.  Even though American has abortion as legal it doesn&#8217;t make it right in God&#8217;s eyes. We could take this to other topics such as pre-marital sex too which isn&#8217;t right in God&#8217;s eyes. It could go on and on.  So again, the judgement will come down between God and that individual. </p>

                        <p>There are so many things I would like to say but, having been brought up Catholic, I know how tunnel-visioned Catholics are. However, I would just like to point out that this so called Almighty God gave us the right to freewill. He gave us the choice to do what we want, whether good or evil. Obviously if we choose evil we will suffer the consequences, but we have the choice nonetheless. These Democrats are not supporting abortion, they are supporting the woman&#8217;s right to choose what to do with her body. Someone can be against abortion but pro-choice. The Catholic church (keep in mind that this is a male run institution) has absolutely no right to say that a woman has no choice. The more I see of the Catholic church the more I am disappointed in it. It is one of the most hypocritical establishments in the history of man and I am ashamed to have ever called myself a Catholic.</p>

                        <p>War is not part of the platform of the Republican party.  No party has a monopoly on the occasional use of military force.  The Democrats, however, are indeed the party which consistently endeavors to maintain a ruling by 5 unelected people, which has resulted in the deaths of 20 million of our fellow Americans since 1972.  Life begins at conception (science has proven this, and the democrats are living in the dark ages.)  Life should be protected.  These are not religous beliefs.  They are scientific facts and universal, humanitarian, beliefs.</p>

<p>If you like the Church scene good for you..If you don&#8217;t, good for you too.  But why is it the bible thumpers that seem to take issue with non bible thumpers ?  is it a cult thing ?  You are electing a president to run a country, of which bible thumping issues represent a small fraction of the issues.  yall bible thumpers better start focusing on much more than abortion or else you won&#8217;t have a home to thump your bible..</p>

                        <p>It is time that people in America take a close look at this issue. Forty-two million abortions and counting.  Someone needs to speak for those who have no voice. People need to take pause and reflect on this issue. The term silent holocaust is appropriate. The issue should not be relegated to a democratic or republican fault finding.  We all as humans have been given the gift of life. We must look at ourselves and answer the question. Why am I silent. Why do I at least reflect on what abortion is; what types of abortions occur; what happens when a aborted child is born alive and left to die.  Slavery did not find its way into the American conscience until the scars and wounds were seen and people saw behind the word describing the issue directly into the depths of inhumanity turned inward against itself.</p>

                        <p>I doubt you have any figures to back that up.  The secrets out, and it&#8217;s not likely that molesters are being harbored by the authorities anymore.  The church is simply policing up their image.  If you had people from your particular party/city/family/gang, saying things that didn&#8217;t properly represent the views of your group, you would likely want to correct them.  As for stopping war before stopping abortion, there will never be an end to war.  There will always be people willing to die for their beliefs.  Am I right?</p>

Of course the democratic is a party of death and proud of it but there are many movements around the world that are just as deadly.  Diane Pediculosis and Joe Bidet are primarily Marxists instead of Catholics and you know the Marxist slant on religion.</p>

                        <p>When did abortion become only a matter of religion? The Pro-Life philosophy is supported by catholic religious doctrine but is equally discovered using basic human reason and philosophy. At best, Biden&#8217;s &#8220;I won&#8217;t impose&#8221; comments are a cop-out; the beginning of a human life is not a question only of religion, but of science and reason. And science supports the life-at-conception stance. At worst, his comments are blasphemous &#8211; does he not believe in &#8220;truth&#8221; as taught by his church?</p>

                        <p>Just another reason to separate from the Catholic Church because of the hipocrasy.  Among the many things I believe that have been taught to me in my 12 yrs of Catholic school are the sanctity of life &#8211; all life, to be a good steward of the earth, to serve the poor and less fortunate, etc.  I think these values are most closely aligned with the Democratic Party.  </p>
<p>The Democratic party is not forcing abortion on anyone &#8211; only preserving the rights of the secular society. Abortion is a personal choice.  And Roe v Wade is a matter of privacy, not a support of killing a fetus. Imagine there is no Roe v Wade and you&#8217;ve just had a miscarriage and your mother-in-law decided that it was because you were regularly exercising and decided to bring charges against you.  Again, it&#8217;s a matter of privacy.</p>
<p>Killing in war and the death penalty ARE state sponsored that are forced upon our population.  We pay taxes and they are using the monies that we pay to kill those on death row and to fashion weaponry.</p>

I&#8217;m a catholic and I see the Churches and the Liberals view. People make this abortion debate such a big thing. Abortion is a cover for someone making a mistake. If they want an abortion go right ahead. One less low life in the world!</p>

                        <p>The founding fathers put the &#8220;establishment clause&#8221; in the Bill of Rights to prevent a church from using secular power to shove its doctrines down our throats.  Despite that clause it took a couple of centuries to get rid of the enforcement of church rules by he government.  It wasn&#8217;t all that long ago that most stores could not be opened on Sunday, that you could be fined for mowing your lawn on Sunday, etc.<br />
If a believer wants to follow the rules of his religion, that is fine, but the government has no right to force me to follow them.<br />
It is even more disgusting that the the church of &#8220;Pedophile Central&#8221; has the guts to preach to us.  The church that did their best to keep pedophile priests from jail.  The church that gave Cardinal Law, one the most egregious  protector of pedophiles a wonderful position in Rome.<br />
I&#8217;ll make a bet that if a cure for a disease is created using embryonic stem cells, the priests and bishops that have that disease will line up to get the cure.</p>

                        <p>70 million American Catholics ,if truly convicted of the tennants of their faith, could change the barbaric nature of killing the defenseless unborn.  How can we expect God to bless America when we have laws that allow the killing of the very life that he creates?  How?  Life is precious and fragile and wonderful.  People wait with arms open to embrace and love the unwanted child.  It is a great stain upon our nation.</p>

                        <p>As a lifelong agnostic, I&#8217;d like to know why the pro-choice side assumes pro-lifers object to abortion on religious grounds.  </p>
<p>I have no clue if there&#8217;s a God, or a herd of Gods, or a pantheon of revered ancestors, or nothing, or whatever.  I have no idea where the universe came from or why we are here.</p>
<p>I did pay attention in sixth grade biology class, so I know when the lives of nearly all animals begin, whether they are fish, rats, or people.  Those lives begin when cells contributed by parents merge to become new individuals.</p>
<p>Call it a fetus (latin for child or offspring) or whatever else you want, but the simple, technical, religion-free fact is that it&#8217;s a person.  </p>
<p>That the person may be inconvenient for other persons does not change that simple reality.</p>

                        <p>I had to stop reading the postings.  So much hatred thinly veiled as commentary or psudo-insights.  Another alcoholic told me not to drink &#8211; because he drank are his efforts invalid?  Why isn&#8217;t a voter or a country equally responsible for the death of an innocent baby equal to the licensed doctor/murder?  The voter who contributes to political causes that destroy the inner city family (great society) or a feckless government &#8216;education&#8217; system that turns out soulless dull imbecilic robots without a nodding acquaintance of the great books &#8211; that voter must be held equally responsible.  I have yet to hear anyone who cashes a government paycheck be a man, stand up and take responsibility for obscene failures in America.  The fortune stolen from those who create jobs, expand the tax base through personal, real risk and piddled away on social engineering and frivolity is a national sin.</p>

                        <p>NARAL is also a religion of a type with certain moral views as is Planned Parenthood. </p>
<p>If one believes as Catholics do that man is a creature composed of body and soul and made to the image and likeness of God that has certain consequences for one&#8217;s ethical outlook which in turn affects the way one looks at politics, and candidates for public office.</p>
<p>The maddening thing about the likes of Pelosi,Giuliani, Biden and Kerry is that they all maintain they are Catholics in good standing, particularly at election time or when there is a papal visit, while all the time espousing views that are identical with NARAL and Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s o.k. to crush a viable baby&#8217;s skull. It&#8217;s o.k. to watch it die, if despite one&#8217;s best efforts she is born alive. It&#8217;s o.k. to press for these wonderful benefits for society. Dare I say posterity?</p>
<p>If abortion on demand is such a good thing then by all means argue for it, but don&#8217;t claim that what you are doing is consistent with Catholic belief. </p>
<p>The gospel according to John after all differs from that of John Stuart Mill.</p>
<p>If the practice of Catholicism becomes a crime in the USA these folks needn&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;ll be no evidence to convict them.</p>
<p>If Roe v. Wade is overruled one day it will not be the end of abortion on demand in the &#8220;enlightened states,&#8221; but there will be many places in the USA where people will choose to restrict it, democratically, acting through their elected representatives. </p>
<p>Criminalization is not al that far fetched. In Massachusetts, Catholic Charities which will not do &#8220;gay&#8221; adoptions is now out of the adoption business. </p>
<p>So much for liberal &#8216;tolerance.&#8217;</p>
<p>I feel a sense of loss for the old Democratic Party. My first political memory is that of my mother and father and aunt staying up all night at the radio to find out if Harry Truman won.</p>
<p>It was hard to leave the Democratic party, but Ronald Reagan was right. I didn&#8217;t leave it; it left me. I have great misgivings about the Bush version of Republicanism (&#8220;41&#8243; and &#8220;43&#8221;)I despise the empire we&#8217;ve become. </p>
<p>But abortion is the litmus test for Democrats. It is their most important issue; it defines what they stand for. You can be a heretic on economic issues like Clinton but don&#8217;t tread on abortion or gay marriage. Those are csacred canons of the party. </p>
<p>Ah the unalienable rights espoused by our deist forefathers, who would probably be regarded as papists today. </p>
<p>Endowed by the Creator with the unalienable right to life. That&#8217;s really strong stuff! But don&#8217;t worry they no longer impose their religion on us.</p>

                        <p>Following the Dred Scott decision, it would have been common to hear Democrat politicians stating that they personally believed blacks to be fully human and deserving of freedom, but that they did not believe on imposing their beliefs on others, or on taking away the property rights of slave-owners. The southern states seceded from the Union in order to protect their slavery rights, and the north, led by the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln prosecuted a war, eventually banishing legal slavery from the nation. Yes, the Democratic party was the party that divided humans into full humans and less-than-humans prior to the Civil War. From the beginning, the Republicans have been the anti-slavery party, the party that believed that all humans were created by God with equal rights that include Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. And the Democrats have not.</p>
<p>Roe v. Wade is the Dred Scott of the last 50 years. It is a horrible decision. It takes a class of humans and defines them as less than human, promotes the privacy &#8220;rights&#8221; of a different class of humans, and allows the second class to deprive the first class of their right to life, guaranteed, among other places, in the Declaration of Independence. This class warfare is reflected in the Democratic economic, judicial, and other positions, amounting to a kind of tribalism that divides the people of America into small, disparate, mutually antagonistic tribes that are rendered powerless to unite and resist Democrats&#8217; usurpation of power.</p>
<p>Political power is the be-all and end-all of the Democratic value system. Divide and conquer, pitting mothers against their children, men against women, young against old, rich against poor, military against civilian, employers against the employed, those who work against those who suckle at the public teat, and dark skinned people against light skinned people, is the tactic they choose. Every single Democratic policy goal supports tribalism. Think about it and you&#8217;ll see I&#8217;m right.</p>

                        <p>The Church hasn&#8217;t changed its position, as misstated by one of the mentioned politicians.  If the politician cannot abide by the Church&#8217;s teachings, that politician should be prinipled enough to leave the Church.  Considering the politicians mentioned, its no suprise that they lack the integretity to simply leave the Church, they want the votes that are attached to their calling themselves Catholic.  They only go to mass when its election time for the photo ops.</p>

                        <p>MR. Savage<br />
I am finishing up your book, &#8220;The Liberal mind&#8230;.&#8221;<br />
I really connect with your books.  I have to flip a page or two sometimes because I don&#8217;t like your rantings but I believe nearly every truth you bring out. But you and all of the others who are talk radio caregivers do not have any answers, with all due respect.  You really don&#8217;t understand the God you talk about sometimes,either.   I think you really believe in Him but you don&#8217;t know who he is.  It would take a very long time for me to tell you of the beauty in the Bible concerning the Jewish people and what God is doing in the earth today.  But I know that you really care about issues and people and on those days that you are depressed your depression is real   I will always listen to you and Rush but I wish you would give somebody a break when they do something that is pro-America and good for the people because you literally have nothing good to say about anyone (The day you criticized Rush was a bad day for me.  My my)   That is unless they are brain children.  You are an intellectual snob. But you could do worse.  I don&#8217;t judge you for that.  I love my children and they are &#8220;intellectual&#8221;  One doctor, one personal health fitness trainer, one seller of modular homes and a 24 year old teacher.<br />
I think so many times when I am listening to you that I would like to help you to understand spiritual principles about our world.  If you want me to I&#8217;ll begin to send you units of  teaching starting with a timeline of creation and God&#8217;s will and purpose for us. I&#8217;ve taught it to women.  It&#8217;s actually  simple and I am concerned that your unregenerate(not a criticism; a bible truth) mind will think it is complete foolishness.  I am sincerely concerned about your mental health<br />
One day I was listening to you and I thought, &#8220;This is a lonely, old man&#8221;. I felt compassion for you.  Again, I believe everything you say but I don&#8217;t like the way you hurt some folks who call you and I would like to hear you say something good about someone.  I appreciate your mind. If you are happy with your understanding of God then just file this somewhere. Mary Ann Colter</p>

                        <p>The dems are automatically for any evil that comes along: abortion (over 40,000,000 murders so far), embryonic stem cell experimentation, sodomite marriage. They were also the party that defended pornography back when it was an issue &#8211; its not an issue anymore &#8211; they won that one too, condoms to the kids, Suzie has two mommies in kindergarten etc etc the list goes on and on. And many so called Catholics blindly follow whatever the party dictates forgetting that we were baptized into<br />

When it comes to welfare, food stamps, nationalized health care, (the list goes on and on) they&#8217;re quite willing to collect other&#8217;s tax dollars at gun point and use it for whatever cause they feel in their moral view is &#8220;just&#8221;.</p>

                        <p>God is the great abortionist given the tens of millions of miscarriages there are every year.  Life hangs in the balance all the time &#8211; the question is where to draw the line.  Does that cigarette and glass of wine which may predate a miscarriage mean the Mom meant harm to the child?  And if the focus is on the feotus, why the emphasis on prohibiting contraception?  Roe v. Wase presented a plausible and realistic way of making distinctions.  The same distinctions when theologians talk about just wars and when men and women are allowed to act barbarically.  The funny thing is that all the Catholic hierrarchy is doing here in attacking Democrats is helping the rich in the United States aggrandize more money, despoil the planet further and play games with the lives of millions of people acroos the globe.  Religion truly is the opiate of the masses when it is allowed to be used to suppress the demcocratic process</p>

                        <p>The Catholic Church, being a multi-million dollar corporation would probably fit better under the republican corporate umbrella. Let&#8217;s see now, the church has threated to withhold the sacraments from people who are pro choice, but I haven&#8217;t heard any such threat about people who are pro death as in capital punishment, war, poverty, withholding medical care, etc.  Just another hypocritical corporation, the catholic church is.</p>

                        <p>The whole issue has been spun to death. The abortion issue isn&#8217;t about &#8220;a women&#8217;s right to choose&#8221;. It&#8217;s about WHEN is the choice made? To put it bluntly, Does she choose to risk creating a life before or after she has sex? Does a drunk driver choose to be a DUI before or after they drink &amp; get behind the wheel? Religion aside, neither side can scientifically prove &#8220;when life begins&#8221;. So why does society not give the same benefit of the doubt to unborn children that they do to convicted murderers on death row?</p>

                        <p>Abortion isn’t legal genocide and should never be compared to it.<br />
People have different views on the creation of life. </p>
<p>Some people believe life begins the very moment of conception, some like myself feel that true life doesn’t begin until you are born into the world.</p>
<p>Genocide is the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national, racial, political, or cultural group.</p>
<p>I’m sorry but unborn fetuses don’t fall under that definition of genocide. It would be more accurately described as a medical act.</p>
<p>You might not agree with abortion, but to decry it as legalized genocide and force millions of others to obey your point of view is ignorant.</p>
<p>People need to quit trying to legislate religious beliefs and views and keep them to discussions with your church buddies.</p>
<p>Greg,</p>
<p>As you state: &#8220;Abortion isn’t legal genocide and should never be compared to it.&#8221;  I disagree.  There are more than one million babies aborted in this country yearly.  In addition, you go on to say: Some people believe life begins the very moment of conception, some like myself feel that true life doesn’t begin until you are born into the world.&#8221;  That is your opinion.  Many knowledge people feel much differently.  So you would kill an unborn baby minutes before it was delivered alive?  If it is not murder then why if the baby dies along with the mother in murder of the mother, why is the person charged with killing two?  It doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p>What if my opinion was arbitrarily that life doesn&#8217;t begin until you are 60 years old?  So for me to cut a hole in your head and suck out your brain with a vacuum would just be a &#8220;medical issue,&#8221; huh?  Stupid logic on your part.  Life should be respected and revered.</p>

                        <p>For the &#8220;Iran/Abortion&#8221; analogy, I&#8217;ve never seen an unborn child/fetus indicate that they want me dead or my/allied country wiped of the face of the earth. So I understand a response that would turn Iran into glass while still preserving the life of an unborn child. The mothers &amp; fathers in Iran of unborn children should get their government &amp; religious leaders to quit threatening other countries. We didn&#8217;t start it, but we can end it.</p>

                        <p>My wife and I taught our children that it was a woman&#8217;s right to choose whether to have an abortion or not. However, we also taught them that abortion was a serious act, not be decided on lightly, and that the fetus was clearly alive and was consciousness just as fully as all life is consciousness. We didn&#8217;t teach them abortion was a &#8220;sin&#8221; because we didn&#8217;t frame it in religious terms. We also taught them that whatever our own beliefs were, it wasn&#8217;t our place to tell others what to believe or do. We thought we were very reasonable.</p>
<p>Our daughter got pregnant a couple of years back, from an affair with a married man, actually. She told us about it and, while we were concerned about her and her lack of good judgment, we were very supportive and understanding. She told us she was going to get an abortion. We were supportive and understanding. </p>
<p>Our daughter got her abortion at the local &#8220;women&#8217;s clinic.&#8221; She offered to pay but was told that she didn&#8217;t need to. &#8220;The government will pay for it.&#8221; (This, even though she had the money and offered to pay.)</p>
<p>Later that day, before going clubbing that evening, my daughter went out with one of her girlfriends and bought a pair of beautiful spiked heels that she calls her &#8220;abortion shoes&#8221;. She thought it was funny.</p>
<p>I am ashamed that my daughter apparently didn&#8217;t learn more respect for life &#8211; or even a modicum of common decency &#8211; growing up. Hers was an abortion of convenience &#8211; birth control by abortion, if you will. THIS is what the Democratic Party fights for and defends. The right for men and women to get rid of that damn inconvenient baby they made. It&#8217;s not about raped women, women who are in danger bringing a baby to term, women who can&#8217;t afford babies, the poor, the minorities, the victims of whatever, etc. etc. It&#8217;s about modern, young, white women wanting to have their fun, f*** who they want, when they want, and not have to deal with the inconvenient being that results. Talk about an inconvenient truth! </p>
<p>The Democratic Party IS the party of death. It is also the party of the self-indulgent. People who aren&#8217;t willing to accept the consequences of their actions if something &#8220;goes wrong.&#8221; You might say they&#8217;re the party of the adolescents of our society (regardless of their age), wanting their &#8220;freedoms&#8221; but not willing to grow up and accept the responsibilities of adult life. Whether it&#8217;s an unwanted pregnancy, an unwanted fight against the Hun, an unwanted need to earn a living, an unwanted real-world marketplace that demands that you get an education (or training) and work hard to make a life for yourself and your family. No matter the challenge, the Democrats are first in line to whine about life being &#8220;unfair.&#8221; </p>
<p>Abortion is just one more way we can f*** our way through life and not have to pay the piper.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t even care what the Church says.</p>

                        <p>Is amazing to read the writings of some bloggers. It does not take a rocket scientist to determine who are sheep (blind dumb followers) and who are people who think for themselves, in other words, use their gray matter (free thinkers). Sheep can not think for themselves, therefore to them, there is no truth other than their own belief and they will blindly follow the sheepherder off of the cliff if that is where the sheepherder leads them. In order to constructively debate any issue, the debater must understand all sides of the issue and discuss it with an open mind. When someone can present a human baby that was grown by any means, without the fertilization of the female egg by a male sperm, then and only then will I be convinced that life does not start at conception. Science proves that life starts at conception, is not just the teaching of christian churches.<br />
Further I will qualify my statement further, no one can say they believe in God and at the same time accept abortion on demand. Has to be oxymoron belief.<br />
Since records have been kept, all civilizations have believed in a superior being, Gods, or a God. They also believed their Gods gave to them and took away from them, accordingly. The greatest minds, one being Albert Einstein, in their writings have all believed in a God.  One thing hard to understand is the supreme court justices that ruled in Roe vs Wade that decriminalize abortion for the doctor turned 180 degrees and ruled that doctors could not assist a patient in committing suicide in the Dr Kevorkian case. In the case of the baby, no one is listening for its&#8217; voice and it can be killed at will, in the case of the suicide wisher, no one is listening either, however it can not be allowed to die.</p>

                        <p>First of all, my sincere thanks to all my friends and &#8216;admirers&#8217; (not); especially those who accuse me of being, horrors, an &#8220;anti-Semite&#8221;.</p>
<p>The word simply no longer has any real meaning to me.</p>
<p>Zionists have accused the Orthodox Jews of Neturei Karta of being &#8220;anti-Semites&#8221; for rigidly adhering to the ethical tenets of the Torah and the Prophets in condemnation and violation of the immorality and demands of the Zionists. And I could lift several comments directly from the prophets Isaiah and Hosea, without attribution, who the Zionists would *swear* are indicative of the vilest &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221; imaginable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done the research for more than 33 years:</p>
<p>&#8220;Anti-Semitism&#8217; originates in the misinterpretation of the Doctrine of &#8220;resurrection&#8221; as the physical raising of a dead body from the grave rather than a Doctrine of &#8216;Rebirth&#8217;. This Pharisaic doctrine was the reason for the crucifixion of Jesus; was expropriated, via the Pharisee Paul, as a fundamental Doctrine of the Roman church (named in honor of those who murdered Jesus); adopted by the witless Muslim theologians in violation of the Revelations received by Mohammed; and resulted in the extermination of the Albigensians.</p>
<p>And, for reasons too complicated to explain here, such a doctrine also plays a significant role in the issue of abortion; which is why, no matter what the Roman church claims, it is NEVER in complete disagreement either with abortion or a nuclear war against Muslims.</p>

                        <p>TO follow Biden&#8217;s line of logic, he believes then that it is murder to abort an unborn child since he states his belief that life begins at conception.  He then believes it is not his place to impose his belief on others.  The Biden philosophy would logically then say that the question of whether murder is right or wrong is up to an individuals belief system.  Noone is guilty of murder.  We can kill who we want.  And damned are those who judge that person.

                        <p>Hurray for the Vatican, who finally said enough is enough. The Catholic church is now practicing what it preaches. American Catholics are sick of Catholics not following Church doctrine and getting away with it. Including that radical hate mongering Pfleger. If the Catholic church does not stand up for what it preaches more and more of the devout Catholics will fall away from it.<br />
It continues to amaze me that those who call themselves democrats think it is OK to murder over 100,000 babies by abortion,yet are in a uproar when it comes to executing one murderer in prison, truly they are the party of death. The church does not presume to dictate to politicians but if they continue to refer to themselves as Catholics then they must follow the doctrine of the religion or change religions.</p>

                        <p>Abortion used as Birth Control.<br />
Using abortion as birth control means that abortion is being used as a back-up method to ineffective or improperly used contraception, or no contraception is being used at all. Of women having abortions, 46% did not use contraception during the month they became pregnant, 8% never used a method of birth control, and<br />
47% have had at least one previous abortion.<br />
Although there are situations in which abortion is in response to health concerns of the mother or fetus, or in response to pregnancy arising from abuse, the majority of abortions are obtained for social and financial reasons. The primary reasons given for choosing abortion are given below.<br />
75% say that having a baby would interfere with work, school or other responsibilities, about 75% say they cannot afford a child, 50% do not want to be a single parent or are having problems with their husband or partner. Using abortion as birth control is not healthy physically or psychologically.</p>

                        <p>OBAMA sees accidental survivors of botched abortions as MEDICAL WASTE, undeserving of a doctor&#8217;s help, undeserving of life.  Though he isn&#8217;t Catholic, he deserves singling out by the Vatican as MANIACALLY EVIL.  I picture him drooling as he pushes an old wooden cart heaped with corpses.

                        <p>Democrats are anti-life.  Republicans are pro-life.  It&#8217;s the most basic and fundamental black and white difference between the two competing political philosophies.  I would vote for Democrats if they were pro-life.  But they aren&#8217;t.  They are anti-life.  Life trumps all other issues.  1.3 MILLION innocent babies are murdered every year in America largely because of the Democrat&#8217;s clinging to a culture of death.</p>
<p>Life begins somewhere.  Democrats contend that the point at which human life begins is ill-defined.  Even more reason to default to the earliest point at which human life MIGHT begin &#8211; conception.  Can any of you out there tell us definitively when life begins?  Can you tell us with enough evidence and authority to unanimously convince a jury of your peers beyond a reasonable doubt that life does not begin at conception&#8230;that it instead begins at some later point.  If you can&#8217;t, then you are sentencing what very well could be a human life to a death sentence because that life imposes in some way on your own life.  So&#8230;you kill the baby.  Nice.</p>

                        <p>It is interesting to see all the mention of nuclear war. This seems to be an odd thing bringing this up since it has only been used twice in the history of the world for purposes of war and that was more than 60 years ago. Besides which last time I checked no one was planning on nuking Iran. (Bombing maybe) Let us also not take Iran out of context they are being led by an man who denied that the Halocaust happened. A person like that is not mentally stable to say the least, not to mention all the times that he has lied and misled the world, by saying that he was going to &#8220;be good.&#8221; (Kinda reminds me of another guy hmmm..oh yeah HITLER) I am not saying that the president of Iran is another Hitler, but I will say that if he had the chance he would kill everyone in Israel not to mention any American he could get a hold of. </p>
<p>This all distract from the main issue however and that is the Catholic Church publicly reprimanding several of its members for supporting a believe that the Church has made clear it does not support. In my estimate if you are not Catholic, you should not be posting. </p>
<p>Let us also not take the quote out of context the article did say that the Democratic Party did risk becoming the party of death on bioethical issues. That is a far cry from every Democrat is evil. As many people have pointed out the Catholic Church also condemns actions that the Republican party is responsible for. So here you have the Catholic Church expressing an opinion and encouraging its members to do the same. so&#8230;what&#8217;s the problem? Don&#8217;t most organizations want its members to stand for what the organization believes? NRA, MADD, DARE, MOVEON.ORG, should I go on. Let&#8217;s also not be so naive to think that we don&#8217;t all, to a degree, want our morals to be legislated. I know I want murder, rape, robbery, theft, etc all immoral and all legislated. So should we stop trying to legislate something just because not everyone believes it is immoral? For myself I can say, by no means will I stop fighting for what I believe. Yes you have a right to disagree, but I have just as much right to likewise disagree.  </p>
<p>So here I am posting any way dispite the fact that I am not a Catholic, but still find myself sticking my nose where it doesn&#8217;t belong. I do apologize. =)</p>

                        <p>Abortion is not a religious issue, but really is part of under the  natural law.  Natural law is imbedded in human beings to help them discern right from wrong.  Everyone understands that it is wrong to take the property of another without his permission. It is the same with abortion:  it is wrong to take the life of an innocent human being. Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine, who lived in 600 B.C., wrote:  &#8220;I will not aid a woman to procure an abortion, though I be asked to do so.&#8221;  Hippocrates was a pagan and yet he understood the natural law.<br />
Religious institutions, such as the Catholic Church, often incorporate the natural law in their teaching.<br />
Thus, the Church teaches that stealing and abortion are both wrong.  Would the critics suggest that the Church not teach that stealing is wrong because it is attempting to force its beliefs on others?<br />
God bless Archbishop Burke for his clear thinking and<br />
courage.</p>

                        <p>Abortion is not a medical procedure.  Medical procedures are ordered toward health.  Killing a fetus does not contribute to its health.  Moreover, the fetus is genetically human&#8211;not just genetically human tissue, but having a complete genetic code of its own, it is a living human being.  Anyone who claims that killing a conceptus is not killing a human being is in need of studying genetics.  There is no doubt that the being that is killed in abortion is genetically human.</p>

                        <p>Burke and the Catholic Church love life so much thet actively fight in court to protect pedofiles who have ruined the lives of men and women through out the world. They actively hide them to this day. His Diocese harbored the refugees from the pedofile camp for priests in New Mexico that had to be shut down because of the problem caused by priests who had been stashed secretly there but allowed to prey on young people during weekend furloughsn for parish work. Lecture me later.</p>

                        <p>It was not always Catholic doctrine that life begins at conception, true? Augustine, Acquinas, and Gregory XIV all wrote that personhood really starts at &#8220;quickening&#8221; or thereabouts, often 40 days. Not until 1869 did Pius IX definitely peg &#8220;personhood&#8221; at conception and consider abortion to be killing a person if occuring after the moment of conception.</p>
<p>Anyway, where is concern over &#8220;culture of death&#8221; expressed by indulgent notions of when war is justified, or the deaths caused by destitution, neglect in the health care system, etc, in a country that doesn&#8217;t have universal health care and a fully functional safety net like almost all industrialized nations?</p>

That&#8217;s disgusting beyond belief.  How about delivering a healthy baby breach and then, when only the head is still inside the mother, cutting into it&#8217;s head and sucking the brains out.  why? The mother finds it inconvenient to have a living child today.  It&#8217;s murder plain and simple of the grossest and most disgusting kind.</p>

                        <p>when abraham kicked ishmael (sarahs first son)out of his house for picking on isaac, the split in religions began &#8211; jesus from isaac &#8211; muhammad from ishmael. its all the same story, there is no true or false to this b.s., they are both true and they are both b.s. and they are both responsible for most everything, and they both suck and neither of them behaves in a manner befitting truly god-fearing people.</p>

                        <p>I&#8217;m proud of the Vatican official from St. Louis!  The vile slow-motion spread of the culture of death at the hands of brainless Hollywood self-serving jerks and the ethically challenged weaklings in our populace is exactly what the world-wide marxist murderers of humanity need to do to the sanctity of our society for them to win against civilization.</p>
<p>The ones who try to equate war with abortion should be ashamed of themselves.  The Biblical admonishment, &#8220;Thou Shall not Kill&#8221; is really &#8220;Thou Shall Not Murder&#8221;.  Warfare to protect your family, your village, city, Nation, way of life has never been admonished.  The people who have made this argument are actually murderers by proxy in service of the seventh century Moslem extremists.</p>

                        <p>The Vatican consistently sticks to it&#8217;s principles. It speaks out for the sanctity of life, not just in the case of abortion but also in regard to the death penalty and wars. I am a Democrat and a Catholic. I am disappointed that the party that wants my vote would also mock my convictions. The convictions will win out in this election.</p>

<p>I believe that ALL morality should be subjective as you do..It&#8217;s a personal choice right Dave. YOU see it as ok for you to let people kill innocent helpless infants in the womb. I have equally subjectively decided that all people named Dave should be used for my shark chum line.<br />
You see Dave&#8230;.it&#8217;s a personal choice of mine. How dare you even think your morality is superior to mine. I mean this is a deeply helf belief I just came to after reading your post. Without a set of immutable rules (Thou Shalt Not Murder) for example any one can do as they please. All you need is enough strength or number or both and you can do as you please.<br />
In America we are good people Dave. We protect the innocent Dave. Yes outlawing the completely unnatural act of infanticide will create problems. Tough, we are Americans Dave. We had honor once. We would not kill the innocent for convenience or profit.<br />
Human life from conception in America is precious Dave. Even one so clueless as yours. BTW&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.<br />

Then anything goes no matter how evil. No lines to cross no barriers to forge all is allowable. For nothing is more evil than a mother killing their own child. It lowers the bar for all evil.</p>

<p>I never once said I was for partial birth abortions, yet that&#8217;s the ONLY abortions used to support your idea that Roe V Wade needs to be over turned.<br />
In fact, partial birth abortions should be illegal in my opinion.</p>
<p>However the majority of abortions done in this country are during the first trimester. The least performed abortion is the partial birth abortion, yet you portray all abortions as the same which is untrue.</p>
<p>It is like you feel it is ok to attack me, distort the truth, all to further your ideals. You&#8217;re all such wonderful &#8220;christians&#8221;.</p>
<p>Using the argument &#8220;Thou shalt not kill&#8221; as a reason to overturn Roe V Wade is insane. That is your religious doctrine, not mine.</p>

<p>For those of you who will &#8220;never kill for any reason, period&#8221;. Keep in mind that the only reason you can take that position is that there is and have been people that would take a human life to allow you the freedom to speak at all.</p>

                        <p>i love these comments. great debates going on.</p>
<p>First, it is unethical for any human being to claim certain ethical convictions while refusing to defend them in any way that affects his/her popularity.</p>
<p>that is exactly the predicament a pro-&#8220;choice&#8221; Catholic politician is in. </p>
<p>Non-Catholic may not understand this, but its very simple: you dont get to pick the doctrines and teachings you like the most. </p>
<p>A Catholic who promotes the unstitutionalizing of abortion, &amp; does nothing to promote alternatives to women who find themselves &#8220;choosing&#8221; them are standing squarely against their own Church. </p>
<p>Pelosi and Biden should get it right &amp; quit speaking on issues they know nothing about (especially when they ought to know better)</p>
<p>Second, yes, it is merely &#8220;popularity&#8221; that motivates them. No one heard abolitionists in the 1840&#8217;s chanting &#8220;I&#8217;m personally opposed to slavery as a &#8216;religious matter&#8217;, but I dare not impose my religion on others. Church &amp; State!&#8221;</p>
<p>No, you see, abortion, slavery, murder, rape, theft, oppression, unjust wars, and the degradation of other human beings are not things you get to play Ponitus Pilate with.</p>
<p>Yes, my Church stands in oppostion to abortion. That doesnt mean, that everything my Church supports and rejects but be conversly rejected and supported by my country. </p>
<p>that argument is based on abject lunacy. supporting alternatives to abortion and finding solutions that help women avoid them and yes even legal restriction on them, is not a violation of the separation of Church and State.</p>

So here&#8217;s one: If you&#8217;re not Catholic, then don&#8217;t comment. If you don&#8217;t vote, don&#8217;t complain. Learn some rules and limits and learn to shut-up. Also, for the Bush bashers, get over it. That ship sailed and left, and all I see are it&#8217;s distant sails near the horizon. Morons with a mental condition.</p>

<p>He DID tell them how to be good Catholics.  If they don&#8217;t want to be good Catholics, if they want to give public scandal concerning the teachings of the Church, they don&#8217;t have to stay in the Church. </p>

                        <p>Excuse me, but most Democrats are pro-CHOICE, not pro-abortion.  There is a distinct difference whether you want to believe it or not. I don&#8217;t believe abortion should be an automatic solution for unsafe sex, but if a woman becomes pregnant through rape or incest, or if the health of a fetus or its mother would be in jeopardy, then yes, they should have the right to an abortion without people who don&#8217;t even know them passing judgement.  Judge not, lest ye be judged.</p>

                        <p>Who could possibly care what the Catholic Church says or thinks.  They have absolutely no control over anything I do and will never.  These pedophile protecting fools are just out of touch with reality and function with a 10th century mind.  Deny all, control all, take the gold and run &#8212; for centuries this has been their attitude and it never changes.  To Hell with them.</p>

                        <p>But I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct killing of the innocent child, murder by the mother herself. </p>
<p>And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another? </p>
<p>How do we persuade a woman not to have an abortion? As always, we must persuade her with love and we remind ourselves that love means to be willing to give until it hurts. Jesus gave even His life to love us. So, the mother who is thinking of abortion, should be helped to love, that is, to give until it hurts her plans, or her free time, to respect the life of her child. The father of that child, whoever he is, must also give until it hurts.</p>
<p>By abortion, the mother does not learn to love, but kills even her own child to solve her problems.</p>
<p>And, by abortion, the father is told that he does not have to take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world. That father is likely to put other women into the same trouble. So abortion just leads to more abortion.</p>
<p>Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want. This is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion.</p>
<p>Many people are very, very concerned with the children of India, with the children of Africa where quite a few die of hunger, and so on. Many people are also concerned about all the violence in this great country of the United States. These concerns are very good. But often these same people are not concerned with the millions who are being killed by the deliberate decision of their own mothers. </p>
<p>And this is what is the greatest destroyer of peace today &#8211; abortion which brings people to such blindness.</p>

                        <p>The Vatican is not in any way endorsing the Republican Party or any other party for that matter.  They are simply warning Catholics that it is immoral and sinful to be affiliated with the Democratic Party.  The Democratic Party is so far gone on issues of morality that it is dangerous for people of the faith to subscribe to their  intolerant, anti-religion, left wing ideologies.  Democrats in positions of power seek to redefine the mores of society which have represented the wisdom of the ages and the foundation for the laws of most civilizations.  Redefining accepted morals so as to welcome the immoral will ultimately lead to the downfall of our civilization.  Corruption, greed, immorality and evil are symptoms of this moral bankruptcy infecting society.  At least somebody in a position of moral authority is speaking out.</p>

We can not shove our religion down another persons throat jsut because we bellieve it is the ways things should be.  The non believers have a right to get abortions.  The constitution protects them from people llike us.  Hmmm sounds like what we are fighting for in a Muslim country.

                        <p>I believe that the Catholic Church and Protestant Churches have remained mute to long and should make they voice heard. The Catholic Church position and statements concerning their teachings are right and proper.  Politician’s seeking to sway voters by compromising their religious tenants for selfish gains is not criminal but a good definition of evil. In the Old Testament the first words given man from God were the three Great Blessings of Be Fruitful, Multiply and take dominion.  Evil was created when individuals sought to fulfill those blessings for selfish reasons.<br />
Individuals seeking to argue when life begins are far too often unwilling to recognize that even in the womb a baby is a live. The New Testament scripture has the story of Elizabeth’s baby while in the womb responding to the presence Jesus’ mother.  New innocent life needs protection and nurturing.  Choice by adults should be to defined as to how they are responsible for their actions.<br />
The U.S. Democratic party has shifted to far to the liberal spectrum and does not value life.  The Liberal Democratic Party uses any means necessary to gain and hold power and does not honor nor respect life.  World history has seen to often political movements claiming to be working for the people. Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot all spoke about creating worlds of prosperity.  All of these mad men were elegant speakers who were gifted in pointing out the problems in the world. Their solutions always brought misery and death because they evil.<br />
The world still has evil men seeking to prosper by using even the people of faith to achieve their goals of power and position.  Religious men and women and they institutions have a voice and responsibility to see God’s work done.  We all fall short of the glory of God but his work is stilling waiting for us to accomplish.  The body of Christ needs to show everyone the correct way in finding peace and prosperity.</p>

What about stealing, lying, murder, false witness, slavery, child molestation? Where does their lunacy end? Is a fetus human or not?  If Joe and Barack think it is wrong, then have they no courage of their convictions? If one believes in something, then one should stand up for his beliefs.  What about the Constitution of the United States of America? Barack and Joe say they believe in that? Aren&#8217;t those laws an imposition of morality? Will they waffle and not protect and defend it?  They are really pathetic cowards masquerading as leaders. There is truth, but Barack and Joe don&#8217;t have it.

                        <p>Often times people make the mistake of saying because of the separation of church and state that church are not allowed to have a stance on political issues nor should we vote based on what we are taught at church.  Both are outrageous misinterpretations of the truth.  We are to vote according to what we believe is right and wrong and we go to church because we believe was is being taught is right.  I have no problem with a priest of any faith having a position on a moral issue to have it made known and furthermore to say that those who attend their sermons should feel that way.  After all, don&#8217;t we go to church because we believe we are being led by men of God?</p>

                        <p>I am a person struggling to follow the example of Jesus Christ through the teachings of the Catholic Church. I have read many comments and I am saddened by the lack of love shown by those supporting life. It seems that many writers who fair well as the Pharisees Jesus confronted. You know the Law, but have hardend Hearts. I wish that the bishops would speak to the politicians in private about these issues and not be so arrogant as to politicize these questions. Jesus refused to be politicized in His life and He is our Leader and Model.<br />
     I have not always been against abortion. But I do believe it is wrong. I equally believe that war and capital punishment is wrong and Jesus taught against all killing. It is ironic that people who support capital punishment forget that Jesus was one of many innocent victims.<br />
     Often people who misuse the word Christianity forget this and this is a historical fact. From the Crusades to Iraq, Christ name have been used to justify murder.<br />
     My point is that as Christians we must be consistent. Yes, we must stand against abortion, And Capital Punishment, And War, and World Povery(slow death), and All the conditions that lead many poor people to abortion. We must also remember and live the Beatitudes spoken by Jesus. Many of us forget Blessed and the Humble&#8230;and Blessed are the Peacemakers. Who are we to throw the first stone. I am not sin-free and I do not judge anyone abortion that is for Our Lord, but I do not support it.</p>

<p>&#8220;if a woman becomes pregnant through rape or incest&#8230;then yes, they should have the right to an abortion without people who don’t even know them passing judgement&#8221;</p>

                        <p>I have read too often about not being able to legislate your religious views on anyone. I have two points on this. When you legislate in favor of abortion youbhave already imposed your view on the unborn. What chance did the child have to speak its mind? Second, the gentlemen who wrote the us constitution certainly imposed their view on the document. They knew power should be separated because human beings have a tendan y towards corruption when they are too strong. They also wrote extensively abouthow an immoral people can not be governed. They also envisioned a country run on principles that are then written into law and the basis of these principles were the ten commandments. This document, has served us well. In the one instance where these principles were violated the row vesus wade decision on abortion, it has left a permanent scar on America.</p>

                        <p>[God said that all days are planned out for you. This tells us that your life is planned before conception.]</p>
<p>This tells us no such thing but is a lot of wishful thinking on your part.</p>
<p>[It was not always Catholic doctrine that life begins at conception, true? Augustine, Acquinas, and Gregory XIV all wrote that personhood really starts at “quickening” or thereabouts, often 40 days. Not until 1869 did Pius IX definitely peg “personhood” at conception and consider abortion to be killing a person if occuring after the moment of conception.]</p>
<p>This is true to a point. There was a broader spectrum of theological views on this matter prior to the seventeenth century when the view of conception (and based on faulty cosmological views) first took root in Catholic thought. Furthermore, this view was not in the majority until after 1869 -indeed there are many Catholic saints who viewed matters differently including St. Alphonsis Ligouri as late as the late eighteenth century. </p>
<p>There is no actual Catholic doctrine on when life begins -indeed the Church has admitted to as much though that does not get anywhere near the advertisement as all the &#8220;from conception to natural death&#8221; statements. And anyone familiar with Catholic doctrine knows that the idea that life has to perdure until natural death is contrary to Catholic teaching pertaining to the right of the state to execute within certain parameters. Also, as this is a scientific answer predominantly, there strictly speaking cannot be. It is true that the predominant view today amongst Catholics is that it begins at conception but that foundation is not as solid as many on this thread so confidently postulate. Indeed rationally it has no shortage of problems to it but I am not about to delve into them right now. </p>
<p>I for one tire of the false dichotomy that somehow the only options for this are either &#8220;at birth&#8221; or &#8220;at conception.&#8221; There are other options as well and taking that view does not make someone more or less a Catholic even if they are in the current minority admittedly.</p>

                        <p>Anyone in this blog who continues to use blasphemy against the Catholic church is simply uneducated about church history.  Remember, Jesus picked His own betrayer.  The actions of a few does not mean it is endorsed by the church. Sure we&#8217;ve had bad popes but that does not mean their actions represent the teachings of the church.  Regarding abortion: plain and simple.  It is murder.  Stop trying to sugar coat it.  If you are Catholic, you must take a stand  and not vote for candidates who are pro-choice.  You say that you are against the war and yet  it is ok to terminate a life in the womb.  Unbelievable.</p>

                        <p>@ Jonathan, who wrote: &#8220;Party of death? If that’s the case, then Catholocism is the religion of death. Crusades anyone? What about the inquisition? Good times.&#8221;</p>
<p>You should try researching history rather than repeating the same, tired argument that atheists have been using for at least the last several decades.</p>
<p>The First Crusade was a reaction to Muslim encroachment into Europe (specifically Spain) and the predominantly Christian territories of Palestine and Syria. While further Crusades may not have been as noble an undertaking, they were, in general, usurped by the secular powers as an end to justify their means.</p>
<p>The Inquisition most often referenced as a slight against the church is more specifically called The Spanish Inquisition, and this was largely perpetrated by the Spanish King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. The Church only authorized an inquisition when Ferdinand threatened to withdraw military support from Rome at a time when they were threatened by the Turks.  The Pope himself later accused the monarchs of overzealousness and greed and attempted unsuccessfully to stop the inquisition.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my hope that next time you think to perpetuate a slanderous myth which has done far more harm than good over the years, you&#8217;ll know your history a little better. Just remember that if you decide to repeat it again, it will be a lie rather than an error.</p>

                        <p>Most U.S. polls for many years found that most Americans admit that abortion is murder.  Legalized abortion has thus, so far, murdered 49 million people in the U.S., and many times that many internationally.   In those countries that are controlled by dictators, the people are obviously much less responsible for these mass murders.   But in the democracies, the people will someday ultimately each answer for any assistance they gave by their votes for each of these many millions of murders.   We should pray for them, ourselves, and for all of the world&#8217;s afflicted.</p>

                        <p>Obama spoke at Planned Parenthood (the U.S. group with hundreds of abortion-for-profit centers).

                        <p>For catholics, there is no issue as to when life begins because every life has a soul and this apparently, just appears at conception. Why a sperm does not have a soul, or an ovum does not have a soul, is not clear. Perhaps each cancer has a soul. Why do humans have a soul and not apes, or starfish? It all smacks of a blindingly crude hypocracy and arrogance. Man in god&#8217;s image? Bah ,that&#8217;s one unimaginative god. Parochial, medi-evil mores are all these &#8216;truth&#8217; peddles have to offer. Barging in on other people&#8217;s lives is the best they can do when &#8216;their&#8217; bizarre take on life is the one that fosters and protects predators.</p>
<p>The ultimate arrogance is the claim to ultimate truth. Luckily enough, should this miraculously be the way things are, they we were all screwed before we came into this world anyway.</p>

                        <p>Go bless Bishop Burke.  As a practicing catholic who attended catholic schools for 16 years I am proud of his outspokeness on this issue.  If american catholics followed the church teachings on abortion they would never support the democratic party or platform.  It is unfortunate that most catholics I have met in my life, here in New Jersey support the democratic party.  It is time they rethink thier decision to constantly back the democratic party and its view on abortion.</p>

                        <p>I love how liberals talk about forcing morals on others as being &#8216;wrong&#8217;. That in itself is a self-refuting fallacy. Liberals force their own particular morals on others all the time. The whole concept of wealth redistribution is a morally motivated policy.</p>
<p>So, really, liberals have no problem with some sort of morality being imposed on others, as long as it is a humanistic, socialistic, statist morality versus a traditional morality from any religion. It&#8217;s acceptable in the book of liberals to use government agents to force one group to pay for the charity of another group, or to use the schools to indoctrinate students to their morality code. In the USSR, even the communists had their own morality code. Anything that was seen as not beneficial to the state was immoral. Both Cuba (still) and the USSR imprisoned homosexuals because that was seen as immoral and destructive to the state (communism being where liberalism was derived from).</p>
<p>Oh, by the way (to the person bent out of shape about wars), the Vatican has been very critical of the actions of the right in terms of Iraq and other war-mongering issues.</p>

                        <p>From a secularist perspective:  If innocent human life cannot be taken in a civilized society, then abortion should not be allowed.  Science has proven that life begins at conception.  Any termination beyond the point of conception is the taking of a human life.  It is simply logic.</p>

                 <div class="commentsBody">
                        <p>My views have been either unintentionally or maliciously misconstrued by other respondents here.</p>
<p>In order to clarify:</p>
<p>1) I am more opposed to abortion than either the pope, the Roman church, or the Christian Fundamentalists.</p>
<p>2) I consider the abortion industry (and the weapons industry) as being elements of a Satanic process for the extermination of both Truth from the earth and the human race itself: While the Jewish, Christian and Muslim religious establishments&#8211;with the full complicity of the media&#8211;are doing *everything* they possibly can to exterminate *Truth* from the earth (discussed in more detail on my website); the abortion industry is doing everything in its power to prevent the &#8216;rebirth&#8217; of the *messengers* of Truth; while the weapons industry (especially the nuclear weapons industry) is doing everything it possibly can to exterminate the human race itself. (The purpose for making those weapons is in order that they be *used*. And the censorship of the Truth about the &#8220;resurrection&#8221; is a NECESSARY element of the incitement for the use of those weapons; with which the Roman church is FULLY complicit.)</p>
<p>3) If the Roman church and the Christian Fundamentalists in the United States were *serious* in their opposition to either abortion or war, there would be thousands rather than millions of abortions in the United States, and the United States would NOT be on the verge of a nuclear war with Iran (Look at what Mahatma Ghandi was capable of achieving in India.) Conclusion: they are not really *serious*.</p>
<p>4) Although I have no evidence whatsoever, my suspicion is that, behind the scenes, money is changing hands in order for the Roman church to be *less* opposed to both abortion and war than it could be. The fact that the church has had to pay BILLIONS of dollars in damages for the abuses of the pedophile priests (where does this money come from?) has presented a situation in which the Roman church could *easily* be bribed by the millionaires of either the abortion and/or the weapons industry to be less &#8216;oppositional&#8217;. After all, the media has been WELL paid to censor the Truth about the Doctrine of &#8220;resurrection&#8221; which would threaten the economic interests of the Roman church. Thus, it is not unreasonable to assume that the Roman church itself could be bribed by the abortion and/or weapons industry for *their* self-preservation.</p>
<p>5) Although the Republicans have paid lip service to their &#8216;opposition&#8217; to abortion, that &#8216;opposition&#8217; has had no *practical* significance. If the Democrats are the originators of this evil&#8211;and I haven&#8217;t done the research to establish this&#8211;the Republicans have been complicit rather than completely innocent. If the Democrats can be construed as the &#8220;party of death&#8221;, then the Republicans can be construed as the *enablers* of the &#8220;party of death&#8221;. And the same goes for the *unconditional* support of both the Republicans and the Democrats for the Zionists of the Israel in their warfare against the Moral Law and the Revelations received by Moses, Isaiah, Jesus and Mohammed.</p>

                        <p>So, Republicans are Pro-Life &#8211; and then what happens when the child is born?  They could care less what happens to the child.  Cut off assistance that is needed for the child to receive proper care, food, etc.  It seems to me that they only care about the child until &#8220;they&#8221; need to pay for it.</p>
<p>I do believe in the right to life.  I am anti-abortion.  But, if they truly believe they are pro-life, then they need to be throughout the whole life.</p>

                        <p>Burke is exactly right. The Democrat/Liberal position is both morally and intellectually indefensible. Pelosi is an airhead who makes up her own doctrine and history to suit her needs (and I guess to sleep at night). The Church should call these phoney Catholic politicians out.</p>

                        <p>Well, that&#8217;s it. According to the laws of the United States, the Roman Catholic Church has just given up it&#8217;s rights to their tax exemption.<br />
If the Bush regime was still interested in upholding the law of the land, the IRS would be directed to act immediately. But just as they haven&#8217;t gone after the evangelicals preaching politics from the pulpits, it is unlikely that they will uphold the law on this either.</p>

Serve the state by working and when you can work no more you&#8217;re no longer worth anything and now you must die. Oh and those that try to compare going to war haven&#8217;t a clue of what&#8217;s written in the Catechism which is why you so blindly and foolishly follow and support the party of DEATH in the first place. Abortion vaporizes 1.2 million souls per year in the US (mostly blacks, hispanics, and poor whites) and THIS is what Obama stands for?</p>

                        <p>Because this statement comes from a church it is mired in religious overtones&#8230;.In reality it is a moral issue, always has been. It has never been morally right to murder an innocent life in the womb. Just because it is unborn does not change the fact it is a living human being. When a wanted child dies in the womb we mourn, yet when an unwanted child is aborted some of us give it no more thought than roadkill. To support this kind of thinking is little different than those who marched millions into gas chambers. Innocent life is either of value or it is not&#8230;.We already know the value system of the Democrats.</p>

                        <p>Burke has done more to set Catholicism back in the St. Louis area than well over 100 years of predecessors.  Make no mistake, all of his proclamations have everything to do with control and power, and nothing to do with bringing light to people&#8217;s lives.  For him to conceal the routine sexual abuses of priests; to not speak about about genocide in the world; to support Republican positions on death penalties, wars, and corporate greed; and to steal property from locals, through the condemnation of the pulpit and the the threat of eternal damnation is inexcusable.  This man is a joke and should spend time in purgatory&#8230;.oh wait, they just decided to rewrite that whole concept in 2006&#8230;.so much for absolute clarity of doctrine.</p>

                        <p>arguing with someone who doesnt understand nor care to understand the underpinnings of the theology they hate&#8230; well, it is laughable. </p>
<p>there is such a thing as invincible ignorance&#8230; and no one group in the entire US can be attacked with impudence like the Catholic Church. We are aliens in a Protestant country. Even after all of these years. </p>
<p>The mal-educated are loud, poorly read, and proud. None can seem to understand that only those who seek Christian Perfection in this lifetime can be hypocrites. The bar is necessarily too high to be attained in this lifetime. Still, we are called to try. </p>
<p>Here I see the same old and tired of the lesser arguments:</p>
<p>1) so-called separation of church and state &#8211; check<br />
2) Catholicism as the anit-science anti-christ &#8211; check<br />
3) moral relativism &#8211; check<br />
4) assumptions re the Inquisition &#8211; check</p>
<p>yep, in the US, Dan Brown and Michael Moore are the standard-bearers of the lay &#8220;intelligentsia&#8221;</p>
<p>give me a break and send the wayward albino monk living under the streets in the catacombs of the Vatican to the fiction racks.</p>

                        <p>Democrats are well schooled at fabricating lies that are convenient to their morally bankrupt positions. Being constrained by the truth is just more than they can handle. How can anyone even hint that the Catholic church has ever been anything but solidly, vocally opposed to abortion and homosexuality. It is scriptural truth and not debatable.</p>

                        <p>I did not know Republicans were willing wage *nuclear* warfare against Iran, seems to me they are the ones working to avoid it while the dems are hoping it will go away if they sit down with radical muslim leaders with tea and crumpets. The dems generally do not mind the murder of 1,300,000 unborn human babies each year in the US, or about 46 million since 1973.  In fact they quite encourage it.  Lefties, don&#8217;t even start, your position on this is  indefensible.</p>

                        <p>In my opinion religion not politics has been the engine that has fueled the killing. While we argue over the abortion issue&#8230; over when life begins&#8230; we go about killing innocents whether they be Vietnamese or Muslims and the church does nothing. It&#8217;s as was spoken in the documentary &#8220;Constantine&#8217;s Sword&#8221;, if we had been dropping contraceptives on vietnam instead of napalm, you would have heard all kinds of outcries from church officials. The same with the Muslims&#8230; we have painted them as a religion that wants to rule the world. Look at us. In the name of God we go out to kill those who are not believers.</p>

                        <p>Abortion is not a religious issue it is a moral/social issue. As any interested party knows the, as a scientific fact, that there is life when cells can divide, move around&#8230; . This is the fact for plants, animal, fungi and humans. To deny this proves person ignorance (willful or otherwise). </p>
<p>The true question is when to people give the child full human rights. The Democrats argue that while the child is in the mother’s womb it has no human rights. This is proven by there actions and deeds if not there words. The Catholic Church argues that the child has human right from the moment of conception. Neither of these positions are religious but moral/social issues. </p>
<p>The majority of rational people can agree that if it a baby is moving, laughing, and smiling it is alive. They can also agree if it looks like a duck. walks like a duck and sounds like a duck it is a duck.  When added together the logical conclusion is that long before birth the pre-born child is human. And if it is human, it should be give human rights of its own but with a degree of preference given to the mother. That is the rights must be balanced with greater regard given to the mother.</p>
<p>There is also a point while the baby is growing that it does not look like a human and some people may rational argue that it is not entitled to human rights.</p>
<p> This is the discussion we should be having &#8220;When should the pre-born be give human rights and how much should those rights be subservient to the mother&#8221;</p>
<p>The Democrats Party platform is that the pre-born child has no human rights and that the mother has full control over it. This is the same as the argument give in defense of slavery; slaves were property and did not have any human rights. In my opinion this is where the Democrats are wrong, if they defended the human rights of the pre-born after the time most people would agree it was human and defended the mother’s superior position before that time the party would have greater moral standing.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t say ANYTHING directly about abortion.</p>
<p>The Bible says A LOT, very specifically and repeatedly, about how bad it is to be wealthy.  But somehow the Catholic Church manages to overlook that fact.  Otherwise they would be chastizing the Republican party.</p>

                        <p>Religion has always been part of American political process.   Religion informs our core value systems.  Would we have been rid of slavery (abolitionists), jim crow (Dr. King), or the great progressive social movements of the 19th century with out religiosly influenced and motivated people?  I think not.  Even the revolution stems much from the 1st great awakening in the colonies in the decades prior.  People must read their history.  De Toqueville had it right, the strength of America is a citizenry whose lives are grounded and influenced by a vibrant spiritual tradition.</p>

                        <p>I&#8217;d hardly call Biden a practicing Catholic. Let&#8217;s see, over the past 10 years Biden has averaged less than $7. a week in all donations or .12% of his annual income.  The last time he went to a Catholic church was probably for a funeral.   Where are his morals?  Does he only want to help people with other people&#8217;s money?  This fits into the pattern of other high Democrat officials. They are the tightest of the tight while Republicans of all religions have recently shown to be much more generous giving 10% or more to their churches and charity.  I don&#8217;t believe in tithing to a church, but spreading 10% of your income to all types of charit1es is probably a good thing to do.</p>

                        <p>Michael Cecil claims that the Republicans are threatening to nuke Iran(not true) but apparently he is failing to keep up with what Mr. Obama has said.  See attached article where:   Obama: Iran threatens all of us &#8212; Won&#8217;t rule out force in speech in Chicago to pro-Israel group.</p>
<p>The reason he states this is because Iran is a threat to the world.  There are actually some things worth fighting for.  Freedom happens to top the list, which is why I oppose Mr. Obama&#8217;s policies of bigger government.  Bigger government takes away my ability to contribute as generously as I want to charities such as Smile Train, Wounded Warrior, St Jude Children&#8217;s Cancer Research Hospital and my church who supports among other things, pensions for African ministers and their spouses.  How much money did you contribute to Africa from your personal bank account last year?  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a wealthy conservative, I&#8217;m still theoretically not going to get my taxes raised under Mr. O&#8217;s plan, but I do not support his defense of letting babies die with no care who have survived botched abortions.  Nor could I ever support killing a baby whose projected birthday is a couple of weeks away.  Can&#8217;t you see how utterly Hitler-esque that kind of thinking is?  And if you want to go there, how about the Terry Schaivo case?  It was the Democratic party who supported her &#8220;humane&#8221; death of starvation and dehydration, not the Republicans.  There actually is little doubt that Democrats are the party of death.  </p>
<p>P.S.  If you want a good laugh this weekend, go see &#8220;American Carol&#8221;.  It shows what our country would be like if President Lincoln had chosen not to fight the Civil War.  Might open your eyes a bit.  Of course maybe you aren&#8217;t as open minded as you think you are&#8230;</p>

                        <p>First, thanks to all who have read this far.</p>
<p>Second, the amount of vitriol against the Catholic Church in many of these posts is sad and staggering.  </p>
<p>Why is it that those who say they are &#8220;tolerant&#8221; and &#8220;accepting&#8221; (most of whom are anti-Catholic, anti-Christan, and anti-Liberty, but certainly not all) are the first to pull out the long knives when someone disagrees with them?</p>
<p>While I don&#8217;t expect that you who disagree with the Catholic Church would take the time to actually *read* her official documents (especially the Catechism), I think it was Bishop Fulton Sheen who said, &#8220;ninety-nine percent of those who hate the Church do so because of what they think the Church teaches,&#8221; inferring that when people actually read what the Church believes and teaches, the hate is (at least) replaced by understanding.</p>
<p>Why Jesus Christ founded the Church on Peter, a fallible human being (as are all human beings &#8212; bishops, priests, and you and me) is a mystery.  However, the truths the Church teaches are just that &#8211; Truths !</p>
<p>(Note to the poster who mentioned the terracentric/heliocentric argument:  understand that faith and reason work together, and consider the state of the world in those days.  Then see if you can understand why the Church took a little longer that we &#8220;enlightened&#8221; moderns to accept heliocentricism).</p>
<p>Truth is absolute.  Those who say it is not have defeated their own argument.</p>
<p>Shame on you for your hypocrisy!</p>

                        <p>This is silly.  The eradication of dogma has led to more evil in the European continent in 30 years (1915-1945) than all the previous evil in all previous centuries.  You dolts who claim ignorance about the obvious, when life begins, are no doubt repulsed because I club baby seals just to hear them squeal!  Oh yeah!  I make omelets out of bald eagle eggs because they are not yet a life!  The best thing about mindless, immoral liberals is that they are a self-exterminating lot.  Most of my friends reproduce like they have hope and something to live for.  My pagan sister and gay brother are childless though.  Abortion is the best idea for liberals to practice.  Although I pray the INNOCENT who are lost.    I wish that America had listened to its noninterventionist Republicans and let Hitler slaughter the lot of Europeans.  The perfect abortion.  You are right, we should have stayed out of that war in Europe and let the abortion loving freaks argue with the Nazi&#8217;s about how war sucks.<br />
God Bless, even you heathens,<br />

                        <p>It’s hard to take this seriously when the Roman Church refuses to discipline members of its clergy who were convicted of genocide in Rwanda or discipline those of its clergy who promoted the Cambodian Genocide (and mass murder in South Vietnam and Laos) by supporting the Communist victory in Indochina. It is also a direct assault on American sovereignty as well as a vindication of principled anti-Catholic sentiment. The Roman Church pretends it has moral authority despite the fact that the pedophile priest scandals has definitively shown that it hasn’t.</p>

We have been waiting for the church to speak out boldly!<br />
Pray for Pope Benedict &amp; Cardinal Burke.  The church has a divine responsibility (higher than man&#8217;s law) to proclaim truth&#8230; we will all be called one day to account for our actions, or lack thereof, in defending the children (born &amp; pre-born). As Jesus declared  &#8220;It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.&#8221; Luke 17:2</p>

                        <p>There are many who fault the Catholic Church for inserting itself into the political fray.  Yet, these same individuals have no problem with the fact that Rev. Jeramiah Wright spoke for some 20+ years not only from the pulpit but directly into the ear of the Democratic Nominee, Barack Obama and his Wife Michelle.</p>
<p>You should believe that the words Rev. Wright spoke had a profound effect on Mr. Obama&#8217;s views.  If you have any doubt about this please do your research on his voting record in Illinois and the US Senate.

                        <p>My dear Michael….where do we begin? You conspiracy theorists truly have a gift for making all things more complicated than they really are. The ONLY thing the Roman Catholic Church is complicit in is spreading world Peace. Only a twisted mind sees otherwise. The Church is also opposed to war, but realizes that there always was, is, and will be conflict. I realize you can’t grasp this, but we&#8217;re a fallen race, and nothing will change that. There truly is Evil in the world, and where it is met, it must be dealt with.<br />
As far as the US being on the verge of nuclear war with Iran…. It will never happen. You must learn to be thankful for Countries like the United States and Israel, who when faced with Evil, will seize the opportunity to quash it. Make no mistake; Iran will not be given the chance to acquire nuclear weapons.<br />
You naively ask, where does the Church get the millions to rightly pay for all the abuse cases? By selling property, it’s really that simple my friend.  And while you’re hung up on the abuse subject, did you know that the incidence of Priestly abuse is appx. 1.5%  of acting Priests? While still way too high, it mirrors that of the general populous of appx 1.3%.  And is no higher than that of any other religious order, or even that of the Boy Scouts. There goes that “fallen race thing” again….<br />
I fully realize you’re a Dove with a capital D Michael, however, thank God there are just enough Hawks in the world to protect the rest of us from the evildoers in this fallen world. Relax buddy, things really aren’t all that complicated. After all, it was Christ who said,<br />
“I say to you, except you turn, and become as little children, you shall in no way enter into the kingdom of heaven.”</p>

                        <p>War was never necessary against anyone?  I suppose that Michael and others would rather be speaking German (if their ancestors had been allowed to live).  I suppose that countries like Iran should be allowed to do as they please and threaten their neighbors as they see fit.  We know how much the UN is going to abate that.  I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll play nice with everyone.  And if they don&#8217;t, then we can have a war and surely it will involve a lot of innocent people.  </p>
<p>No, surgical strikes on nuclear facilities and strategic locations is preferable.  And where did Michael get his info of us going to nuclear war in the first place?  I must have missed that.  I don&#8217;t recall anything but conventional weapons being used since WWII.  As always, there is someone on the fringe left that will seek to change the main conversation by diverting and elevating the talk to something on the extreme edge.</p>

Then that didn&#8217;t quite do the job, so let&#8217;s have abortion legalized.  OK so you got it!!  Next we can&#8217;t make up our minds to decide, abort or not to abort.  Well, let&#8217;s wait 7 or 8 months.  OK, let&#8217;s wait till the birth, and then we can suck the the little &#8216;whatever&#8217;s&#8217; brains out and just kill the little &#8216;whatever&#8217;. Happy now?<br />
No??  Well then what&#8217;s next??  You PRO-DEATHers are responsible for the dramatic increases  in the murders of new born babies, dumping them in flushes, trash containers and whatever is available at the time.  You have made life worthless with your total disregard for human life.  Shame!!!</p>

                        <p>I don&#8217;t know who all you bloggers are but none of what you say makes any difference to anything related to abortion. Abortion is a simple issue. If you believe life begins at conception (it&#8217;s a proven scientific fact that human DNA exists in the embryo) then abortion is murder &#8211; end of conversation. If you can justify in your moral value system that life begins when you decide it does then abortion at anytime other that what you think, even partial birth abortion, should be ok with you. If you believe the former then abortion is not a matter of choice it is a matter of murder and is not related to any other things. If you think the latter abortion it just removing something that is causing you an inconvenience &#8211; end of conversation. Any other conversation in just wasted rationalization and has no relevance at all. </p>
<p>The choice in this election is clear. On one side the candidates are strong believers in the sanctity of the life of the unborn child, on the other side are strong believers that  anyone who wants to can kill their unborn child even using partial birth abortion. Shut America and make your choice. All should be happy that America finally have the chance to go on record before God and everyone as to where we stand. Don&#8217;t waste your time talking about it, it&#8217;s a personal choice based on you moral value system and your view as it relates to the respect you have for human life. We will show what our true value system isin this election. I think it&#8217;s great and don&#8217;t care what anyone else thinks. As I said before it&#8217;s a personal decision just shut up and make it. If you don&#8217;t have a value system that lets you make this decision without input from others you might want to think about a vote against abortion but that&#8217;s up to you I couldn&#8217;t care less what you think on this issue.</p>

                        <p>Take religion out of the abortion issue for this argument and decide &#8211; when does life begin?   </p>
<p>Most rational people agree that murder is wrong.  Once life begins, abortion has to be murder.  It is always murder no matter how that life began, rape, incest, loving sex, in-vitro fertilization, makes no difference, if life has begun then it is murder.  If I am the product of rape or incest is it OK to kill me when I am 50 years old? So, all this stupidity about abortion being OK in rape and incest makes no sense &#8211; it all depends on when life begins not how it begins.  I can agree with terminating a preganancy early if the life and health of the mother is at risk but then every reasonable effort must be made to support the life of the baby because they are alive!</p>
<p>There is no scientific answer to when life begins so it is anyone&#8217;s opinion. If you choose to believe (are of the opinion) that life begins sometime after conception, then you need to decide when that is &#8211; 4wks? &#8211; 20wks? &#8211; 28 wks (commonly thought of as the age of viability i.e. in a medical sense when the baby is more likely to live than not if born then)? -full birth?  If it is anything other than full birth then late term abortions are murder.  If you think life begins at full birth then you should be OK with abortions up to the very second of birth &#8211; at 40 weeks.  If you think life begins at some other time than birth, then to me you are just arbitrarily picking numbers.   Most people agree that the abscence of brain function (brain death) is the end of life.  Take that backwards and you could argue that the beginning of brain function is the beginning of life &#8211; that is about 1 week after conception &#8211; so almost every fetus is alive one week after conception and thus almost every abortion is murder even from a purely scientific view.</p>
<p>We as people have a responsibility to prevent murder, no matter where or how or when it occurs, no matter whether we like, know, approve of or care about the victim, .  Yes, we have a responsibility to prevent the type of murder called abortion by direct intervention, legislation, education or any other non violent means.</p>
<p>If you are a religious person, the Bible clearly teaches that life begins at conception.  So, for any christion every abortion is always murder and every christian has a right and responsibility to actively work against abortion.  </p>
<p>I know of no one who has said that you have to be perfect before you can encourage others to be better.  So, just because the Bishop or the church is not perfect, they can still encourage others to be better.  I am very over weight but I can still encourage my wife to lose weight, this is not being judgemental, this is being human and supportive.  The bishop did not encourage that the politicians be stoned, cast into hell or anything like that &#8211; he just wants them to follow thier faith better.</p>

                        <p>Many of these comments seems like they are touchy.  How hard is it to understand that when you support the termination of 47 million helpless infants, you are changing the life of the country.  The only thing that the Vatican did was reaffirm the facts.  Prayerfully, i hope that this message and other messages from the Bishops will change the hearts of the many Catholic who have been misled by those who deviate from Church teachings for selfish reasons.</p>

                        <p>Can&#8217;t impose your religion on others? Everyone has deeply held beliefs that drive your decisions.  It is impossible NOT to have a belief system. Not all religions have deities. How then can you say you have no religion.  You CAN&#8217;T have equal care and concern for all points of view, it&#8217;s an impossibility. Try and have equal care and concern for views of a rapist and the woman he wants to rape.  It is not possible. Either he gets his way, or she gets hers.  We KNOW that her way is correct.  Stop trying to sound high and mighty and say &#8216;you have no religion&#8217; &#8211; you absolutely have beliefs and a point of view.  The point is &#8211; whose view is correct?</p>

Amazing to me that were even worried about this Obama and his cronies getting control of our Nation!

Ronald Regan was right when he said that &#8220;freedom is just 1 generation away from being lost&#8221;&#8230;now were watching that very thing happen&#8230;God help us! reminds me of a song by an old group called Megadeath, &#8220;Symphony of Destruction&#8221;, next time you see a rally for Obama, turn down the tv volume and throw in the cd.</p>

                        <p>From what i understand of this article the Bishop was only referencing the fact that two of the democratic party&#8217;s leaders WHOM mentioned the fact they were Catholic. </p>
<p>his article mentions abortion it was not him saying this for some political race, it was the Bishop reminding those  and not just the 2 mentioned that if your Catholic then live by those teachings,, now being most of the Catholics or those that proclaim to be  are in the democratic party. </p>
<p>his words were just a reminder of the teachings of the Catholic church to which all say they belong and aspire to follow those teachings so follow the teachings, and not the teachings of the democratic party that go against the teachings of the Church ,  abortion which democrats are mostly in favor by party lines   hence the suggestion of the &#8220;party of death&#8221; this said because it went against the teachings of the catholic church which these people listed and others love to proclaim  which is wonderful if its just to let people know they belong to that church and not for political gain  my take on this  as for republicans in this and all others in the world the church are not without sin but they  possibly do not belong to the Catholic Church so the Bishop makes broader statements on this as a church position on the other arguments that are stated within this post this becomes separation of church and state, they are views/opinions of the church. but to say i am a Catholic live by your teachings and teach from those  as taught to you by that same church   not by direction of a political party   if you feel these teachings are not correct to your beliefs then  you need to do a couple of things look elsewhere for a church, and quit calling yourself a Catholic, in life those that believe God is first and foremost before anything else and from this dictates  how you go in your lives on a daily basis</p>

                        <p>Get a grip people. The Church is against the willful decision to take life by medical abortion. They are also against taking human life via weapons of mass destruction, genocide, terrorism, etc. There is an established Judeo-Christian concept of a &#8220;just war&#8221; and active resistance rationale for combating I.E. Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, Soviet Russia, Communist China, and militant Islam for starters. If we chose to die rather than actively resist violence that is also an acceptable alternative. Putting your liberal heads in the sand is not an option though. As people of faith evil must be confronted either actively (just war) or passively ( Ghandi). If you cannot descern the difference between a just war and murder you are simply blind. The West is full of the &#8220;usefull idiots&#8221; as V.I. Lenin was so fond of. Get a grip, hooray that the Catholic Church is standing up for absolute truth-bravo!<br />

<p>if they can not teach by their own church which the publicly say they belong why say i am Catholic</p>
<p>Any group formed has laws and bylaws which the members are required to follow in order to remain members of said group to which you freely confess , agree enter into contract and agree to uphold  these people did just that  they agreed to uphold the catholic church and their teachings in their lives, and the Bishop  just reminded them of this agreement they have with the church they freely belong to and are members of</p>

                        <p>If life does not begin at conception, then when does it begin?  This is the unanswered question which indicts the &#8220;wisdom&#8221; of abortion advocates.</p>
<p>Conception is the creation of life from the contribution of a living woman and a man.  Life begets life.  It is the very essence of life and the procreation of mankind.</p>
<p>It is difficult to understand how interfering with this life giving biological process through which a baby is delivered &#8212; absent only the interference &#8212; could be construed in any manner other than tampering with a natural process that inalterably leads to life.  This is how we all got here, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>The Catholic church states the obvious &#8212; men tamper with God&#8217;s creation at their own peril.  The church speaks with clarity, wisdom and sound logic in defending its dogma but more importantly it speaks truth!</p>
<p>I pray for those who believe that man can or should tamper with the creation of life with no consequences.</p>
<p>If an American politician wants to portray himself as a &#8220;Catholic&#8221; then the basis for that characterization is fair game to be explored.  No different than if an American politician wants to present himself as a Veteran.</p>
<p>The Church should excommunicate any politician who supports abortion while portraying himself as a Catholic.</p>

There is evidence that the church cooperated with the Nazis in their party of death (the Holocaust)&#8230;the Democrats were in charge when America won WWI and WWII&#8230;Had they failed, there would today be no Vatican, no Church.

<p>Sick.  But it makes sense.</p>
<p>Rom 1:28-32 ESV  And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.  (29)  They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips,  (30)  slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,  (31)  foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.  (32)  Though they know God&#8217;s decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.</p>

                        <p>I am catholic and was taught that I am not supposed to kill anyone, or be part of a group of people that kills.  Therefore, I, and I mean me; myself   is bound by these rules.   I will not have an abortion and I will not kill anyone and I will live my life according to the 10 Commandments.<br />
However, I must forgive and must not impose my views to others unless they are willing to accept them.<br />
So, what is the difference between having an abortion (killing a baby) and invading IRAK and killing people?  Maybe, you can kill thousands and that is OK, but if you kill an unborn child is sin????<br />
Killing is killing and both should be condemned.    No religion has the right to impose it’s views on people that do not want to follow that particular religion.</p>

                        <p>I don&#8217;t see anything being forced on anyone here! This is a true statement and I doubt seriously it will cause anyone to change thier religious affiliation! The political correctness in America is literally strangling us to death! Our country&#8217;s forefathers would not have hesitated to allow this innocent statement to be viewed at a presidential race!</p>

                        <p>The real issue here is the fact that mankind is guilty of sin and it manifests itself in innumerable ways. People have defined for themselves what is right or wrong and therefore made truth relative from one individual to another. So how do we know who&#8217;s right? Well it has to come from someone that is greater than ourselves, who has already established truth that doesn&#8217;t change with the passing of time. It comes from God who made himself known through his son Jesus Christ who came and died on across for the sin that we are all guilty of and was then raised to life three days later proving that he was who he said he was. It is only through believing and placing your faith and trust in him and nothing else  that God cleanses us and forgives us of our sin. God&#8217;s word ( the bible) is the standard for truth, right and wrong, not the countless opinions of others that flood these news pages. I know that some will simply say that they choose not to believe what I&#8217;m saying but it&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m saying in the first place it&#8217;s what God himself has already said. So people can choose not to believe if they want, God will not force you, but you will stand before him in judgement regardless. The bible says that apart from a relationship with Jesus, people will have to spend eternity in hell because of their refusal to believe by placing their faith in Jesus. You want to know the right view you should have in relationship to all the posts that have been put up here? You&#8217;ll only have a correct understanding if you belong to Christ.</p>

                        <p>The posters here amaze me with their lack of knowledge of history or misinterpretation thereof. Europe&#8217;s wars of religion were really over who would be rulers of particular territories. The Crusades were in response to  centuries of wars of aggression and ethnic cleansing on the part of Muslims. Religion was merely used as a method of propaganda to motivate the masses to become soldiers or otherwise aid in the war effort. In our day and age the only religion that wages war because of religion are Muslims. Posters misquote scripture saying &#8216;Thou shall not kill&#8217; when it really says &#8216;Thou shall not murder.&#8217; There is a difference though one wonders if they could ever discern it in their ignorance.  Over the last 100 years nearly all of the world&#8217;s war, misery, and mass killing of innocents has been perpetrated by those who would now be labeled as &#8216;Progressives.&#8217; They labor under labels like the National Socialist German Workers Party, Socialism, Marxism and Communism. Hundreds of millions of innocents were murdered by the command of people with names like Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, and Hitler. People who all had one thing in common; they were socialists. Just like the &#8216;Progressive&#8217; liberal Democrats in today&#8217;s America.</p>

                        <p>No matter how anyone twists this story, it&#8217;s about Life and following the teaching of the Catholic Church. A &#8221;fetus&#8221; is a human being. It&#8217;s not a dog or a cat or any other kind of creature growing in the woman. Life begins at the moment of conception, and it&#8217;s touched by God and given a Soul. This belief cannot be changed by the Church, it&#8217;s non negotiable. Centuries can come and go, but the teachings of Christ will never change. An abortion for whatever reason is forgivable. All you need to do is be truly sorry and repent. You can also urge society to refrain from irresponsible behavior. When you have sex, yes, there is a chance the woman will get pregnant! Most women regret their abortions, and the main reason they have it IS because they have no choice!</p>

                        <p>since abortion was legalized. a lot of  people seem to use it as a birth control.  maybe men need to be more careful. i myself am catholic and we are not to believe in abortion. the soul enters the body at the moment of conception. but if you do not bleive in god then that is your choice. it is something that you will have to deal with when you leave this earth. i knew someone that had an abortion at 6 months into her pregancy.  could not belive it. tried to talk her out of it. happened about 10 yers ago. i never forgot about it. all christians should not believe in it.  i feel.</p>

                        <p>What needs to be added here are some numbers and other facts.  Abortion in America tortures and kills 3000 babies a day.  We can call it whatever name people want, but that is what it does.  Americans dying in Iraq used to be an average of 2.3 deaths a day, which is far lower than about 40 murders in the US and perhaps 3 to 5 murders in Chicago alone.  About 7000 people die in the US per day not including the 3000 liberal abortion murders.  So Iraq is a quite low percentage of American deaths while abortions are a huge percentage of that &#8211; and yet the media who hated Bush can only find stories for the 2.3 deaths and none others.  Now lets add the 3 million deaths in Vietnam and Cambodia when the liberals like Jane Fonda and John Kerry asked us to pull out. Anyone smart enough to understand that no matter how you get into a war, if you leave and abandon your allies, lots of people die?  Obama and the Democrats can&#8217;t figure that one out and want to repeat slaughter in Iraq by surrendering.  And my internet says that communists killed more than 50 million last century, with Mao at 40 million and Khmer Rouge at 2 million and there were others.  But liberal Hollywood loves the communists and seems to hate Senator McCarthy who tried to warn &#8211; hey you know?  These might not be nice people.<br />
And then there is the civil war where Democrat Stephan A Douglas was for slavery and so was the supreme court in their 1860 Dred Scott decision that said Black people aint got no rights (overturning the 1820 Missouri Compromise which began to free some slaves), and it was Republican Lincoln and many other Republicans who fought to the death against the evil Democrats to free African American slaves. Whoopi Goldberg on the View seems to imply that Republicans want to enslave her.  And liberal presidents sat on their butts while some of our embassies burned and 230 Americans would die and looked the other way until Bush came along.  Read the history books sports fans. Democrats are becoming the party of death.</p>

                        <p>Q: When does human life begin? </p>
<p>A:   After a child&#8217;s first birthday? On the day a child is born?  When they are in the birth canal?  One week before that?  During the 8th month of pregnancy?  Fourth month?  If you believe the answer to that question is &#8220;above your pay grade&#8221;, then the default should fall on the side of life.  If you can&#8217;t specify when life starts then you must also acknowledge that abortion could indeed be an act of murder. </p>
<p>&#8220;Pro-Choice&#8221; is a an oxymoron.  It can only exist under the false pretense that there is only one life that affected by that &#8220;choice&#8221;.  Imagine, just for a moment, what &#8220;choice&#8221; the millions of innocent murdered babies would make if were possible to give them that opportunity.  If that&#8217;s too abstract, try this; imagine what YOUR &#8220;choice&#8221; would be if you wound up being on the wrong side of  someone exercising their right to &#8220;pro-choice&#8221;.  </p>
<p>The argument of &#8220;if you are &#8216;pro-life&#8217; but you are not anti-war and anti-death penalty, etc., then you are a hypocrite&#8221; simply does not hold up.  Wouldn&#8217;t the counter-argument be that &#8220;if you are pro-choice&#8221; you must be &#8220;pro-war&#8221;, &#8220;pro-death&#8221; penalty, etc. or else you are a hypocrite&#8221;?  It is safe to say that as a general rule the opposite of aforementioned is true.  Does that mean that those who are &#8220;pro-choice&#8221; are only for death when it deals with the most innocent of all human beings?  Oh, that&#8217;s right; a woman&#8217;s right to choose only involves the woman&#8230;there are no innocent human beings being murdered when an abortion is performed.  That false pretense must be adhered to or the whole argument comes crashing down.</p>

                        <p>Whether you like it or not , Archbishop Burke is perfectly right.  Check out the Democratic vs the Republican party platforms and the positions of the various candidates.  Though not all Republicans vote completely pro-life, many do and many others support many of the pro-life positions.  Definitely not so for the Dems.</p>

                        <p>Way back up the string, Dave claims that it is &#8220;unethical&#8221; to impose ones religion on another.<br />
Were you correct and consistent, Dave, you would then be required to decriminalize murder in any form. That is a religious belief, grounded in Judeo-Christian teaching and theology as promulgated by God according to Exodus, Chapter 20.<br />
Now, if you disagree and asert that murder should not be allowed, whether or not you accept the notion that its prohibition is based on a religious belief, then you must also accept the principle abortion (infanticide) must also be prohibited. Otherwise, you have demonstrated that you have made the choice to simply make up whatever laws suit your own personal preference and fancy, lacking any logically consistent grounding. That, of course is one of the hallmarks of political liberals, including most Democrats, today.</p>

                        <p>I think it&#8217;s high time we remove the tax free status of churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, etc&#8230; and really, REALLY get on with being a country that embodies the separation of church and state.  It&#8217;s gotten so ridiculous that I can&#8217;t stand it.  Why is so much power over the decision on abortion given to Christian believers anyway?  It&#8217;s not their decision to make.  The fact of abortion is that it is now, in the year 2008, a legal, science-based medical procedure that we as biological human beings, regardless of faith or atheism, etc&#8230; have to deal with.  The fact that the argument whether a fetus has a soul (Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish, Dianetic, etc&#8230;) or not will never, ever be resolved screams out that the only way to settle the issue is to have freedom of choice!!</p>

<p>Let not your heart be troubled attempting to discern why some of your fellow Catholics would take a stand against abortion while defending ANY warfare, such as in Iraq where killing does indeed take place.<br />
You might want to read St. Augustine very thoroughly so as to understand the concept of a &#8220;just war.&#8221; After doing so, you MIGHT then want to argue that Iraq does not meet St. Augustine&#8217;s test and demonstrate why it does not.<br />
You might also want to abandon your reading of the &#8220;ten commandments&#8221; from the King James Version of the Bible. With rare exception, language and Bible scholars now agree that Exodus 20:13 is properly translated from the original texts as &#8220;You shall not MURDER.&#8221; I hope that you would agree that the concept and meaning of &#8220;murder&#8221; is a vastly different from the concept and meaning of &#8220;kill.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>To correct some of you the bible says thou shalt not murder (note not kill). Those of you who think that abortion is ok because the parents dont want a child? Lets follow that line of logic&#8230; Homeless people are an annoyance they are poor and give nothing to society so lets take them all down to the homeless clinic, or old people, PETA annoys me can I kill them since I don&#8217;t want them arround? And how come if you kill a pregant women a person can be charged with two counts of murder? Is it not the same fetus? Beign wanted, being loved, being a contributor to society is not what gives is value but that God loves us all everyone equally.</p>

                        <p>All said and done, how about this inconsistency.        When a doctor? cut off limbs of a living baby, sucks it brains out till it dies, is a legal unpunishable act.  But when this is done outside the womb, this same act is murder! Anyone ever seeing a video of it will be an instant pro-life supporter. Pro-abortionist are fighting toot and nail to prevent any abortion film or video.  They are coldblooded morons void of any respect of live but their own! Finally God can still open or close the womb, regardless of men&#8217;s procreation abilities, which is also a gift.</p>

If our laws state life begins at birth,then how can we also have laws that charge a pregnant woman with child abuse for smoking and drinking,or when a pregnant woman is killed in a automobile accident or mudered,the suspect is charged with a double murder?Double standards?</p>

                        <p>You are either a &#8220;practicing Catholic&#8221; or not!  The Ten Commandments are clear and so is the Church&#8217;s teaching. Archbishop Burke is speaking specifically to abortion and the proponents of abortion (infanticide)  We have literally killed in the United States alone since Roe v Wade almost 50,000,000 babies.  This is murder, and our church is right to stand up and sanction those who would press for the continuation of this blatant disregard for God&#8217;s commandment &#8220;Thou shalt not kill&#8221;  using the mantra of a woman&#8217;s &#8220;right to choose&#8221;  Only God can give or take a life.  As a Catholic we are taught that if we continue in a grave sin, then we cannot receive the sacraments, which include receiving the Holy Eucharist, which is the real presence of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, body, blood, soul &amp; divinity.  That is what is being addressed here.  When a public figure blatantly continues to denegrate Our Lord by receiving Him in grave sin, our Church must speak out in order to help correct this blasphemis behavior.  They continue to give public scandal to the Catholic Church, therefore they must be publicly reproached.  I say, it is about time that the Church step up and speak out for life, at all stages!</p>

                        <p>&#8220;Girl, you made me hate. And when I go to hell you can meet me at the gate.&#8221;  Thank you Jackie Greene, for that line from the song Follow You on the Giving Up the Ghosts CD.  Every time I hear that song I think of Nancy Pelosi.</p>
<p>Pelosi&#8217;s partisan hatred of all things Bush is poisonous to her and all who follow that path.  Comments like these are the results of such poison.  Nancy Pelosi has been changed by this poison, and so has the Democratic Party.  I believe it is the acme of intellectual dishonesty to convince yourself abortion does not kill.  </p>
<p>When people talk about choice, it&#8217;s not the choice of whether or not to have an abortion, although that&#8217;s probably what 98% of us think of first.  It&#8217;s the choice we make to believe when life starts that is used to justify killing.</p>
<p>I support a woman&#8217;s right to kill her unborn child.  If the government can force her not to have an abortion, then the government can force her to have an abortion.  We cannot give this power to government, and even if women decide to kill their unborn children, it is their choice.  Just stop lying to yourself and the rest of the world about the killing. </p>
<p>It is better that mother&#8217;s have the right to kill their unborn children, than the government having the right to kill unborn children.  That&#8217;s the real choice.</p>

                        <p>What I’ve noticed, most particularly in politics is that for the most part people don’t reach the height of indignation when lies and mischaracterizations are spread about them: they get that way when the truth is told about them.  That is the case here.  Abortion is an evil practice and it is as essential to the Democrat platform as wealth redistribution.   These same officials (Biden and Pelosi as classic examples) that “personally oppose” abortion while showing enthusiastic support for it in the legislative process explain that they don’t want to “impose their religious beliefs” on others.  However, they have no problem citing their religious ideals of “compassion” and “charity” as a justification for imposing wealth re-distribution – particularly when chastising conservatives.  The Democrat’s are undeniably the party of death and taxes – and the evidence is their indignation to that label.</p>

                        <p>Abortions as they are performed today in medical clinics all over the world by doctors with accredited degrees in modern medicine have a lot less to do with anything written down in any religious text written 1000&#8217;s of years ago.  It&#8217;s a different world now.  Not everyone believes in and, at least for now, not everyone has to believe in the faiths born of these old texts.  Because we are a nation born of the separation of church and state it&#8217;s an ethical decision and not a moral one now.<br />
      As stated above this issue will never ever be resolved one way or another so why don’t we just let it go and accept pro choice as the only resolution.  Unless your religion promotes the intolerance of other points of view then one has to accept freedom of choice in this day and age.  The United States is not a Christian nation!!!!  It’s a secular nation with Christians in it!!  Whether you are an atheist or a believer in whatever doesn&#8217;t matter concerning the issue of abortion at least as a political decision to be made by Democrats or Republican or from whatever party.   It’s shameful the way politicians simply use abortion as a means of garnering votes or credit with their people.  I think an honest and wonderful thing to hear from a politician on either side of the fence when asked their opinion on abortion would be, “I’m done with that debate because there is no resolution that will make everyone happy so let’s just leave it alone the way it is for ever so we can move on.”  That a leader in the Catholic Church chose to make the statement about democrats in the manner he did further demonstrates the need for people to quit looking to some of these people and their ancient ways for answers to some of the modern dilemmas we face.</p>

                        <p>You pro-choicers are rediculous sometimes.  You suggest that no one should tell you what to do and how to live your life, but you want other people to pay for your decisions.<br />
Aren&#8217;t pro-choicers for choice, and if you make a choice that results in a pregnancy, why are you expecting others to pay for it, by having the govenment tax us with no choice being given to us.  (For those suggesting that health care is the responsibility of the state and not of the parents)  It&#8217;s probably the most rediculous argument I have heard so far.<br />
You know there is such a thing as adoption.  There are thousands of families willing to adopt &#8220;any&#8221; child in America, yet you feel the only solution is to kill a child because you think that you can&#8217;t get health care.</p>
<p>Come up with a better argument, please.</p>

   The church can say whatever it wants to say about abortion.  It can deny the sacrament, if it wants.  I was baptized Catholic 6 years ago, and now I&#8217;m not so sure about it.  They want to hold others accountable to the faith when they themselves cannot.  I don&#8217;t care what anyone says, you do NOT have to agree with everything your religious leaders say.  If your faith brings you to it then remember that you will answer to your God someday.  All others, including the Catholic Church, which can&#8217;t even police itself, should shut their pontificating mouths and stay the hell out of politics.  Unless you want the rest of the religious mix involved (Pat Robertson, James Dobson, etc&#8230;).  This is a secular Government, NOT a theocracy&#8230;</p>

                        <p>I have to agree with what Archbishop Burke says. The dems will kill an unborn child without a second thought but rail against putting a mass murderer to death. I can&#8217;t really understand their reasoning. I&#8217;m not a fan of the death penalty for children or murderers but you&#8217;d think they could see how absurd their stance is.</p>

<p>The only problem with your sad argument is that no nuclear war has occurred.  No killing of Iranians has occurred.  In fact, no killing of any human being with a nuclear device has occurred since WWII.</p>
<p>There are approximately 1.37 million abortions per year just in the U.S.  That is more deaths than all of the wars the U.S. has ever been in.</p>
<p>But I guess when you consider that it&#8217;s only a mass of inanimate tissue and not really a human being, then who gives a crap, right?</p>

                        <p>Religion is not the biggest factor in determining politics! AND it never should be. The only sensible thing I&#8217;ve read so far was about the separation of church and state. A Catholic or anyone else for that matter should not be able to even vote against same sex marriage or abortion, I&#8217;m sorry but &#8220;because god said so&#8221; is not good enough. Also it is the responsibility of the parent to be responsible with sex but keep in mind that many people cannot afford birth control, and do not have transportation. You can&#8217;t deny people resources and then punish them by taking away their right to choose. It&#8217;s time to think outside of the box. For example, if a single women gets pregnant and has to drop out of school, how is she going to afford childcare which averages 10,000 dollars a year? Our institution makes the victims that we throw away. When a child is born into poverty it&#8217;s impossible for them to achieve. And the &#8220;privelaged&#8221; class is not privlaged if they are born into it.</p>

                        <p>Remember Scott Peterson who killed his pregnant wife? He got charged with 2 counts of murder, one for his wife and one for his unborn children. Say, I am 3 month pregnant and a drunk driver hits my car and my unborn baby dies, that drunk driver will be charged with homicide. So in our society the death of an unborn baby is not murder if the mother kills the child but is considered murder if someone other than abortion Doctor kills the child. So its the baby is considered a life if you want it but if you don&#8217;t its just an embryo..Weird world we live.</p>

                        <p>In the article &#8220;Abortion and Infanticide,&#8221; Michael Tooley argues that abortion and infanticide are both acceptable because life does not begin until the human child gains self-awareness. This generally occurs around 18 months after birth.<br />
This country’s framers of our government state in the Declaration of Independence  is based upon the &#8220;self-evident&#8221; truth that &#8220;all men are &#8230; endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights&#8221;. The proposition was God gave mankind the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. These ideas were claimed as justification for the rebellion of the American colonies. The U.S. Constitution is written based on this belief shared by the founders. It was this belief that President Lincoln felt was at the heart of our Civil War. President Lincoln at Gettysburg restates for everyone North and South the proposition of that individual rights are derived from our creator.<br />
&#8220;Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&#8221;<br />
This country’s record has not always been consistent in the treatment of races, religions, and gender. Yet throughout this nation’s short history good people have given their full measure in serving others in the cause for true liberty. The Michael Tooleys and Barack Obamas in this world argue eloquently about rights while justifying the slaughter of the innocent. These men and groups they represent make no sense. They want to play God and have a government or political party determine when life begins and what rights are granted individuals. They argue against the very principles and birth right that belong to all mankind from the moment of conception.<br />
 Before the Civil War Religious people spoke out against injustice against a race. When women were treated as property religious voices pointed again to the proposition of unalienable rights. Today voices are again pointing to unalienable right of life. The rights given by God are unchanging and absolute to all. Individuals who believe otherwise undermine their very own existence. Man&#8217;s unalienable rights are sacred for the same reason that they are unalienable&#8211;because of their Divine origin.</p>

                        <p>&#8220;if men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230; and it would still be the cold-blooded murder innocents &#8211; even when administered by those with &#8220;accredited degrees in modern medicine&#8221;.</p>
<p>The world is indeed a different place than it was during the formation of Judeo-Christian faith.  We now know that a full strain of DNA is formed at conception – one that will remain unchanged throughout the life of the individual.  Therefore, using a strictly scientific/secular standard – a unique human life begins with conception.  However, without a moral context this indisputable point is moot.  E.g.: if there is no “Creator” to endow an individual with certain “unalienable rights” &#8211; with “life” being first among them – then what standard it to be used?  Apparently that can be left to individual “choice”.  The Catholic Church is not a perfect institution – but it has unwavering moral resolve and clarity regarding abortion.   Abortion is an absolute abomination and a moral stain on our society greater than that of slavery.  I pray that it does not take America as long as it did to recognize the abomination of slavery.</p>

                        <p>Since the 50&#8217;s we have been living under the way the Left says is right. Their Religion has kids killing kids in school and killing teachers. Their Religion has made us build more prisons where they get drugs, internet, work out rooms. Good food, TV and much more. This is prison? We don&#8217;t want to say that wrong is wrong anymore. Can&#8217;t you see how our country is going down and will not be much of a country anymore? There is right and wrong. If you want to do wrong like killing babies, tell the truth. When people have sex outside of marriage and a baby comes along, it is the baby that has to pay with its life. We call ourselves adults but don&#8217;t want the responsibility. We want to be kids and play. But life don&#8217;t work that way. If you want to see America go down then stay on the Religious left.</p>

                        <p>The Catholic church is a staunch defender of precious human life and those of us pro-lifers appreciate their unwavering support.  However, those liberal whiners who bring the kitchen sink into the dialog have no standing and they are a simple smoke screen to the real issue.  The issues of the world can be discussed til the cows come home, but the focus in these forums should remain true to the original article.</p>
<p>Now for the second part of the topic:  life is as one previous blogger stated, the completed DNA structure.  Lest anyone misunderstand, it is the beginning of a human life, the half nanosecond of the union of the ova and the sperm, a dynamic wonderful human machine in the making.  Any human who destroys that life is a murderer in reality.</p>
<p>We pray for murderers to repent and to champion life instead.  May the Lord bless America&#8211;listen to His call for you to repent and know He is your Savior and receive life through Him.</p>

                        <p>The Catholic Church is a vast money-making empire born directly from the ancient Roman mafia families, and founded and invested in a history of blood, martyrdom, murder, clandestine manipulation, spying, victimisation, persecution and finantial extortion.</p>
<p>Even now the Pope expects even the poorest Catholic to give the church money they cannot afford, whilst sentencing people to even greater poverty by attempting to enforce a ruthless ban on contraception and thereby ensuring babies and children die from bad diet and appalling sanitation.</p>
<p>On top of all this the Pope continues to give the green light on the persecution of gay men and women, and to even stay quiet when abortionists are targeted by terrorists.</p>
<p>I do not think that the Pope headed Catholic church is anything but the same body it was when it was first formed.</p>
<p>It is an organisation riddled with control freakery, greed, bigotry and an appalling lack of real compassion and any kind of profound understanding of the doctrine of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It is NOT a church worth listening to on any subject.</p>
<p>It is an organisation of the captive.  It is the death of human rights.  It must be ignored!</p>

                        <p>Yeah for Archbishop Burke!   I sincerely hope that other American bishops will come out and reinforce Catholic teaching on this.  Being pro-life is something all Catholics should be and if they are not, they had better study up on Catholic teaching.   The Catholic church founded by Jesus Christ has always been 100% pro-life, and always will be!  Jesus would not condone killing innocent babies in the womb.  B.Obama does condone such killing.  Therefore we cannot have him be president of our country.</p>

                        <p>Burke use to be our bishop here in Wisconsin &#8211; he often made us scratch our heads wondering why his actions were different than he preached. He was always preaching about saving the &#8220;rural way of life&#8221; and the dignity of the farmers yet he closed more rural churches in our diocese than any other biship. Another thing he did was build a multi million dollar shine where we could go pray for the poor&#8230;.the most ironic part of the shrine is that you have to drive through a very bad trailor park to get to it!

<p>Actually, you are mistaken. America was built on the backs of African slaves and even before the days of slavery, the colonists wiped out enormous populations of Native Americans (either by disease, which in some cases was the first ever recorded instance of biological warfare, or the usual convert-or-die method). The colonists believed in the Manifest Destiny and superiority, and they used the Bible, religion, and God to justify greed, slavery, and crimes against humanity. No matter what you say, the birth of the nation of America is steeped in blood and moral failings, as is every other nation. Our &#8220;greatness&#8221; cannot be discussed without also raising the ethicality of the building of this nation. I find that the statement is true, &#8220;Happy is the nation that has no history.&#8221;</p>
<p> In conclusion, I am American but I do not subscribe to the belief that America has attained a level of perfection or morality that is superior to the rest of the world. I am a student of history and I can assure you that America, even in the case of abortion, is just as imperfect as it ever was.</p>

                        <p>I understand Raymond Burke&#8217;s frustration at the democratic party&#8217;s position on abortion, however it is quite blind to not consider the impacts that such a strong statment makes.  this now isolates every member of the catholic church that considers themselves democrats.  I do not support abortion, however i do not take that as a top priority in choosing which candidate to support, i consider other very Christian ideals such as environmental related topics, foreign aid, thrift, war, etc.  This disheartens me as a christian.<br />
Perhaps the stone throwing comment that started this conversation off is the most appropriate.</p>

  I assume you also count those churches (particularly Black churches) that support the Democrat positions and Democrat candidates in your statement, &#8220;If churches want to weigh in on political topics then they must PAY for that priviledge and lose their TAX EXEMPT STATUS.&#8221;. Is that correct, or do you want to pull the tax exempt status of those churches that disagree with your political ideas.</p>

                        <p>Archbishop Burk is only speaking the truth; he is not blaiming any one party. One cannot deny that the majority of, or close to all of the democratic party is pro-choice. The Vatican does not side with one party; the fact that republicans happen to be more conservative, is just what it is. As a matter of fact, the Vatican has fairly looked at both parties with a sense of diappointment, because of the country&#8217;s capitalist, and at times, unfair ways. Save deer, birds, foxes, wildlife, and sea life, but murder babies in wombs; is that a position you really want to take.</p>

                        <p>For all you posters who believe the Catholic church considers other human rights issues to be on par with abortion, you clearly haven&#8217;t read this: http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/sep &nbsp;/08091203.html. </p>
<p>And for those who don&#8217;t want to read the whole thing, here&#8217;s the pertinent part: &#8220;When we have someone who has that stand on a disqualifying issue, then the other issues, in many ways, do not matter because they are already wrong on that absolutely fundamental issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only when taken to a level of insanity could a &#8216;pro-war&#8217; candidate be considered on par with a pro-abortion candidate in the Bishop&#8217;s view.  &#8220;If we had a candidate in favor of a war in Iraq in which we decimate the entire population and we kill as many civilians to impose as much terror on everybody as possible to make sure . . . If that was in opposition to a pro-abortion person then I&#8217;d have a real conflict of conscience because you&#8217;d have a direct and intentional killing of innocent persons on one hand and the direct and intentional killing of persons on the other hand, said the Baker Bishop.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we don&#8217;t have that issue with capital punishment, we don&#8217;t have that issue with the war in Iraq we don&#8217;t have that issue with the present Administration,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>And yes, I&#8217;m intensely curious about the church&#8217;s tax-exempt status in all of this. Not sure how this sort of advocating, which I&#8217;ve heard in church on Sundays, for specific candidates jives with its 501c3 status.</p>

                        <p>Wow.  Lots of &#8220;interesting&#8221; comments.</p>
<p>First, just because Archbishop Burke has said that the Democratic party has become the party of death, doesn&#8217;t mean he has called the Republican party the party of life.  The Republican party is simply the party where there is still hope for life.</p>
<p>Second, as long as there is pride, there will always be a need for war, because there will always be tyrants who will only be able to understand one thing: getting their butts whupped in war by those whom they wage war upon in order to dominate.  I am making no statements about Iraq or the war on terror here.  I AM making a statement on the modern sentiment that all war is evil and that there is never anything good for which it is worth fighting.  This sentiment is completely wrong . . . especially in the industrialized West where this is simply an expression of laziness in regards to justice and courage to do, and fight for the good.  Prosperity make have secured material survival, but it has meant the death of the soul.<br />
Third, morality is NOT religion, but naturally pairs with it because one cannot be holy and sanctified if one is immoral.  Morality is graspable by human reason, and therefore, all human beings are responsible to follow its dictates.  These dictates are derived directly from the respect due to human beings because of their innate dignity.  They are also universal because there is only one race, the human race.  Therefore, morality IS something that is higher than, and therefore FORMS, just laws.  Unjust laws are immoral, and they are to be ignored as they do not fulfill the requirements of true law.<br />
  The Ten Commandments outline the most serious moral prohibitions and (except for the fourth commandment, intrinsically) obligations.  That there is a god is also graspable by reason.  We can know something about Him without Divine Revelation.  We cannot know Him with it.</p>
<p>Fourth, because morality is universal, it is not a sectarian imposition on others of different religions, or no religion at all, to demand that the requirements of morality be met.  It IS an imposition on others to demand that they accept, and give legal status, to your immorality.  It IS an imposition to demand that they allow you to craft laws that enable you to put the negative consequences of your actions on them, while you take all the positive consequences of your own actions for yourself.</p>
<p>And as for the &#8220;Pro-Choice&#8221; position, women don&#8217;t just suddenly get pregnant like they get a cold.  There is a choice, and everything that follows is result.  Sex isn&#8217;t just for fun.  It&#8217;s sexual REPRODUCTION, and the human cycle is 18-20 years worth of material, social, moral, emotional, psychological and spiritual support from the time of conception.  The problem is not unwanted pregnancy, the problem is what has drive men and women to have such a careless disregard for human generation that they think they can &#8220;play and not pay.&#8221;  Maybe if we thought about what we do and the impact, we might realize that it is not love and thought for someone else that motivates people to put sex before, or just plain outside of, marriage.  It&#8217;s lust, it&#8217;s loneliness, and no matter how much we don&#8217;t want to admit it, its selfishness.</p>
<p>Its time to stop making up lies to cover our tracks when we do something that is bad for us and bad for others.  Its time to choose the good and do it.  The only failure is to keep doing what doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

                        <p>As an active pro-life and catholic I agreed completelly with the Vatican views of the Democratic Party, I use to be Democrat, not any more, and just because of the view the party has about abortion, euthanasia, etc. LIFE is precious since the very begining until the natural death. And you can not be a CHRISTIAN and pro-abortion.<br />
The Catholic Church is not impossing their view, they are telling you what is truth since the Old Testament.<br />

                        <p>I believe the major problem with our world today is people trying so hard to make what they know is wrong into being right. Trying to pretty up there words so that they don&#8217;t feel so bad about it.People know what is right and what good morale values are.  whether it be religion or politics. And as for those that might say politics and religion don&#8217;t mix, they are flat out wrong.The truth of the matter is abortion kills human beings. It&#8217;s not the killing of trees or animals. It is a human life with a soul.It is in my mind murder no matter how pretty you want to make it sound.</p>

                        <p>We have become a nation of people who do not have to be responsible for their own actions. Using abortion as birth control is abominable!! And don&#8217;t deny it but basically that is what is happening.<br />
As far as comparing the chuches involvement with this and our involvement with Iraq and Iran etc is rediculous.<br />
Thousands of Kurds were gassed by Saadam and buried under a highway. The rape rooms in his &#8216;palace&#8217; were real, and our going in to rid this part of the world with this kind of evil is a blessing to women and a race of people that had no other options or hope in their future.<br />
Do we like war any better than the other side? Not just no but H&amp;LL no!!!  After Obama has taken all our military capability away from us and there is no one to stop this evil from invading the world (and they are already here, believe it) who then will be there to save us?<br />
God gave us all choices, and we had better make them carefully.  The change he is calling for is NOT change we can live with. America with all its faults is the only country of HOPE for a world falling apart.  Without our military strenth we are ripe for takeover.<br />
Mr. Obama has also voted 4 times against stopping late term abortions.  Does this make a difference???</p>

                        <p>Roland,</p>
<p>I find it interesting that you consider me &#8220;self righteous&#8221; when I simply stated historical events. Building nations isn&#8217;t clean and perhaps you missed it, but I said that in my original post. If you were to look at my post again, you would see that I took issue with the notion that our country was made great from &#8220;not having contempt for GOD&#8217;s spiritual truth.&#8221; The way in which our country was made great was, to use your words, not &#8220;neat and clean,&#8221; and many things that were done in the building of America could be considered an abuse of religion because there were those who invoked God&#8217;s divine favor and/or blessing in the practice of slavery, intolerance, theft, and dishonesty. (I also pointed out that all nations have equally disreputable backgrounds).</p>
<p>I should have included that Native Americans were also used as slaves and that there were European indentured servants, though the European indentured servants came to America by their own free will and exchanged their labor for the transatlantic passage. Technically, I was incorrect to use only the the term &#8220;African slaves&#8221; to describe the early beginnings of America, though the main point of that particular part of my post remains the same (slavery was used).</p>
<p>I do not dispute the fact that America is a great country, but I do take issue with the notion that everything that made our country great was the result of &#8220;not having contempt for GOD&#8217;s spiritual truth.&#8221; As history shows, some of the very practices used to acquire land and propel America to where it is today were based on practices that show contempt for the Christian principles many colonists of that time professed to embrace, and that cannot be disputed. At the beginning of our nation, at the very foundation, man&#8217;s best and worst qualities were at work.</p>

<p>If anyone out there has an unwanted pregancy and is considering abortion, I know lots of people who would love your baby, including me.  Also, there are lots of support options if you are brave enough to accept (and keep) the most beautiful gift that God gives &#8211; life.</p>

                        <p>As a member of the Catholic Church, I can say without hesitation that the Vatican is not consistent on pro-life issues because this really isn&#8217;t about fetus; it is about controlling the lives of women, always has been.  The Cathoic Church has a long, bloody history of rape, torture, imprisonment, theft, murder and mayhem when it comes to the treatment of women.  Women have next to no voice in church affairs, but are expected to financially support the institution that shows them and their supporters such disrespect.  Senator Biden and Speaker Pelosi are just the latest targets for badmouthing.  American women, in particular, are singled out for their stance on reproductive issues, but, for the Bishops, it really is a loosing position.  There is no going back to the &#8220;good ole&#8217; days&#8221; when men ruled;  today&#8217;s women expect to have control of their reproduction, as well as most other aspects of their lives and threatening our supports and those who show respect for others, itsn&#8217;t going to change the outcome of progress for women and other that the church hierarchy has mistreated and continues to deny their human rights.  Go Senator Biden and Speaker Pelosi; keep speaking your truth to power, we support your efforts.</p>

                        <p>Re:abortion, et al.  Such actions are wrong because they are  morally  wrong, not because any religion says so. Although one of the people in this discussion may find a &#8220;religion&#8221; that endorses destruction of life. A Jim Jones type I suppose.</p>

                        <p>The Catholic Doctrine is pro-life.  Nancy Pelosi stated that after years of research, she could not find the Church stand on when life began.  The statement is simple, pro choice Catholics are in violation of doctrine.  I am sure Nancy Pelosi was shocked to find that out. She did research the subject for years.</p>
<p>You can argue if it is right or wrong, all day, but reading the Catechism of the Catholic Church will answer questions on the Church stance on Abortion, War, Suicide, and the Death Penalty. Nancy Pelosi should buy one, or she can use mine.</p>
<p>As far as the Separation of Church and State.  The intent was to prevent the Government for identifying one church as the &#8220;National&#8221; church. It lets Americans chose their church.  </p>
<p>If you believe in abortion, find a church doctrine that supports it. Don&#8217;t expect the Catholic Church, the Universal Church, to except the legislation the United States has come forth with.  </p>
<p>Another insight might be to actually read &#8220;Roe vs Wade&#8221; rather than regurgitating what you hear on television. It made me question a father&#8217;s rights, or how did we get to aborting a child while in the birth canal.  Obama has voted four times that a child surviving an abortion, should be left to die.</p>

                        <p>Michael Cecil and others would do well and serve the cause of truth if they&#8217;d first consult scholarly works on the issue of waging a just war and the legitimacy of preemptive action in certain limited circumstances before spewing this nonsense that adopting  a lawful though controversial position, i.e. the war in Iraq, is the moral equivalent of the willful taking of innocent human life, whether in the name of &#8220;choice&#8221; as with abortion or &#8220;convenience&#8221; as with assisted suicide or &#8220;science&#8221; as with cloning, stem cell research. Everyone is free to accept or reject the basic teachings of the church, but, if you repudiate them, at least have the courage to admit that you&#8217;re calling yourself a Catholic only as a matter of birthright and political expediency, not because you accept the church&#8217;s core beliefs.</p>

<p>Jesus last words to the people crucifying Him, spitting on Him and Mockings was in love and mercy&#8230; saying &#8220;Father forgive them &#8211; FOR THEY DO NOT KNOW/UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE DOING.</p>
<p>As I read the commentary to this article was so full of hatred, spite and envy, etc&#8230; I felt the wounds they intended in my heart, soul and mind and it hurts deeply. I am sad that still the &#8220;liberal humanitarian&#8221; democrats and republicans cand still spew such hatred with so much concern for their own opinion without the ability or even slightest hint fo wanting to appreciate or understand the other person- who has just as much value and the other.

                        <p>I am a mother and a wife of 13 years.  When we miscarried it was one of the saddest times in our lives. The day I was blessed with my son I found it to be one of the most joyfullest experience. I do realize that there are women who have unplanned pregnancies- worst cases even raped. I don&#8217;t want to get into a blog debate or point the figure at anyone. As a women I just can&#8217;t understand how life can be taken away regardless the circumstances. On average every day, over 3500 viable babies are aborted in the USA alone..  That&#8217;s over 1.2 million abortions every year here. War is soldier to soldier and sadly civilian are lost. I lost a good friend myself. Abortion is mother to child. My heart feels broken as it did when I lost my child at14weeks. I think about what he or she could be like.  Yes I believe in God. I am not a Catholic. I do believe that we as a people-especially women should do something to end the right to abort. Unfortunately there are no real leaders that have courage to get the ball rolling to put a complete stop to Abortion. So I don&#8217;t think it truly matters what political party, what church you are a part of. If a baby dies before it is born &#8212; as in an abortion &#8212; the woman who conceived it is still a &#8220;mother.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>Everyone is overlooking the fact that the Catholic Church did nothing about the forced abortions taking place in the Marianas Islands (Saipan), a U.S. territory, for the past 15 years. Various Catholic officials and groups were informed and asked to intercede on behalf of 11,000 women (not a child among them). However, they allowed the practice to continue and never interceded with any of the &#8220;pro-life&#8221; Republican politicians who prevented U.S. labor law from being applied to the Marianas Islands. Human Rights Watch has condemned Catholic Church labor policies in the U.S. The issue was finally resolved after the Democrats took control of Congress in 2006 and certain &#8220;pro-life&#8221; Republicans were defeated.</p>
<p>If the Democrats are the Party of Death then Archbishop Burke represents the Church of Forced Abortion . There are many other similar titles which could be applied but I will forgo the opportunity to list them.</p>

                        <p>All life begins at conception and will continue to grow if nutured.  We need more Catholics speaking the truth, instead of the Pelosi&#8217;s and Biden&#8217;s, either misrepresenting the truth, or taking the easy way out and saying &#8220;I will not impose my views on others&#8221;.  That is what all politicians do, so when it comes to abortion it&#8217;s different???<br />
Why upon reading these comments do I see so much on what to do with &#8220;unwanted children&#8221;?  What child is unwanted?  That is a disgusting thing to say.  Anyone ever hear of ADOPTION?  Abortion is so selfish, and thinking you can&#8217;t afford a child is just ridiculous.  So many couples would be happy to raise a child.  The pro-choice movement never sees adoption as a choice.  And even here, the pro-lifers forget about it.<br />
Think carefully  before you vote.  Abortion is evil, and it is the evil that leads to so many others. The pain and suffering it leaves behind is devastating.</p>

                        <p>It&#8217;s such a joke for the Vatican to prosecute Liberal Democrats for being &#8220;pro-choice&#8221;, at the very moment that it is promoting the canonization of &#8220;Hitler&#8217;s Pope&#8221;, Pius XII, who NEVER used any of the powerful weapons he had in his quiver against ANY of the many, many Roman Catholic ultra-conservative &#8220;pro-life&#8221; ( i.e. anti-abortion) leaders of the Nazi regime:<br />
        What did Pope Pius XII do about any of these Roman Catholic architects of the Jewish holocaust:  Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, Josef Goebbels, Reinhard Heydrich, Rudolf Hoess, Julius Streicher, Fritz Thyssen, Klaus Barbie, and Franz Von Papen or<br />
R. C. Engelbert Dollfuss who was head of the Nazi state of Austria.<br />
R. C. Leon Degrelle  who was head of the Nazi state of Belgium.<br />
R. C. Emil Hacha  who was head of the Nazi state of Bohemia-Moravia.<br />
R. C. Ante Pavelic  who was head of the Nazi state of Croatia.<br />
R. C. Adolf Hitler  who was head of the Nazi state of Germany.<br />
R. C. Miklos Horthy  who was head of the Nazi state of Hungary.<br />
R. C. Konrad Henlein  who was head of the Nazi state of Sudetenland.<br />
R. C. Pierre Laval  who was head of the Nazi state of Vichy-France.<br />
R. C. Henry Petain who was head of the Nazi state of Vichy-France.<br />
R. C. priest, Fr. Augustin Voloshin  who was head of the Nazi state of Ruthenia.<br />
R. C. priest, Fr. Josef Tiso  who was head of the Nazi state of Slovakia.<br />
R. C. priest, Fr. Andrei Hlinka  who was head of the Nazi state of Slovakia.<br />
R. C. priest, Fr. Anton Koroshec  who was head of the Nazi state of Yugoslavia.<br />
Did Pope Pius XII excommunicate any of these the most visible Catholics in their countries at the time?  NO. How can anyone say that this pope did &#8220;all that he could&#8221;, when he failed to take this obvious measure so as to make it clear to the millions of Catholic faithful who were enabling the Nazis to carry out their campaigns of mass murder, not only against Jews, but against their fellow Catholics in Poland, that they should have no part in these monstrous of crimes and most mortal of sins?<br />
        On the other hand, after the Nazis were defeated and no longer posed any threat to the pope, the Vatican, or the Catholic Church anywhere, did Pope Pius XII allow the Vatican to be used to protect thousands of Catholic war criminals such as the above to escape punishment for their war crimes? YES.  Whose side was the pope on?</p>

                        <p>It is true in a sense that the Democrats (particularly Sen. Obama) have shown themselves to be a &#8220;party of death.&#8221;  Speaker Pelosi tried to manipulate what the Church teaches about when life begins showing confusion.  Sen. Biden claims to be Catholic and yet, in order to rise in the political sector, will stray from his faith to support abortion in order to obtain votes.  Sen. Obama has voted against medical care for children who have survived an abortion.  I thought he was FOR universal health care?  Now that these children are &#8220;living&#8221; human beings (now that they are outside the womb), why will he not support their entitlement to health care?</p>
<p>When we start to qualify what life deserves protection with the defenseless unborn children, who else will lose their right?  The elderly who become more of a burden in intensive nursing facilities &#8211; especially once their medicare or other health insurance runs away from their obligations (as we did by bailing out the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac quagmire)?  Our bishops and pastors were given the authority by Jesus to treat those who disregard Church teachings as tax collectors and sinners (Matt 18: 15-22).  Of course, that is after a period of attempts to bring our brother/sister back through charitable fraternal correction.  Our bishops have tried that.  I think we are near that last step.  When parents do not follow through on their promises (and threats of punishment) with their children, their children soon learn that their words mean little.</p>

                        <p>I am a St Louis, practicing Catholic. I am father who has been and is raising 4 children in the faith while supporting my parish and our school. Many of our immigrant fore fathers and mothers fled miserable conditions in countries and cultures where the heirarchy of Catholic church was in bed with the wealthy and abusive leadership. In the US they are in the pocket of the Republican party. Good riddance to Raymond Burke, I hope he votes in Italy&#8230;</p>

                        <p>It seems to me that Pascal&#8217;s wager apply&#8217;s very well concerning the issue of abortion. Whether a zygote, an embryo, or a fetus is a living human being is not the issue. It is an accepted medical fact that life begins at conception, this is indisputable. At conception growth begins, metabolism begins, these are recognized signs of life and any biologist studying the DNA will clearly identify it as human, hence, it is Human Life. The question is when does this human life become a person, for it is the &#8216;person&#8217; that has an unalienable right to LIFE, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. Here&#8217;s where Pascal&#8217;s wager comes in. There are four possibilities &#8211;<br />
1)It is a person and you defend it as such.<br />
2)It is a person and you deny that fact.<br />
3)It is not a person and you defend it as though it were.<br />
4)It is not a person and you agree with that fact.</p>
<p>Scenarios 1 and 3 describe the Pro-Life advocates. The best that can be said of them is that they recognize the unborn for what they are and have chosen to defend them as best they can. The worst that can be said of them is they are defending something that is not a person, however, given the natural course of events, eventually will become a person.<br />
Scenearios 2 and 4 describe the Pro-Choice side. The best that can be said of them is that they recognize the unborn for what they are not and have chosen to defend a woman&#8217;s choice to have sex without consequences, no harm, no foul. However, the worst that can be said of them is that they are defending murder of the most helpless and innocent of our society.<br />
It seems to me the only ethical choice is to err on the side of life. If I&#8217;m wrong, then I&#8217;ve spent my life trying to raise society to a higher level of morality; to bring a little bit of dignity back to the act of human sexuality, rather than just using another person to get my rocks off. But, if you&#8217;re wrong&#8230;than God help you, you are defending one of the most horrific and heinous behaviors ever know to man.<br />
Oh, by the way, just an interesting statistic, there have been over fifty million abortions in the United States alone since Roe vs. Wade was decided 35 years ago. Fifty million&#8230;if that&#8217;s not a holocaust or genocide I don&#8217;t know what is.</p>

                        <p>This article is not about war. How can you pro-choice people compare abortion to war? A helpless unborn child has no voice on whether it can be allowed to live or be killed. But a soldier who is well aware of his actions and able to determine right from wrong and can very well put down his gun and walk away, CHOOSES to engage in the killing of other people. There is a BIG difference here. Why can&#8217;t you people see that??</p>

                        <p>I think the more neo-con catholics (whether bishops or not) fight against progress and an enlightened society, the less influence the church has in the world. I&#8217;m not sure Joseph Ratsinger understands this very well. The more conservative he and his bishops are, the less relevant the institutional church becomes.</p>

That being said, I am conservative, and in any normal circumstances, I would never terminate a child growing inside of me under normal circumstances, however, if I were raped tomorrow, I would be downing the morning after pill as if it were to save my life (or the abortion pill for that matter).  I could never bring a child into the world out of such an atrocity &#8211; and if you are one of those idiots that hates when people argue this point, then you are just that, a VERY selfish idiot (that I&#8217;m nearly 100% positive would be changing your tune if this happened to you or someone close to you).  That also being said, if by some divine intervention that happened and pregnancy happened to go further into term than the first few weeks to months, I would NOT terminate, as I believe partial birth abortion is just as terrible.  To simply put this, this is NOT a black and white issue (read everything I just wrote), and furthermore, the goverment has no place legislating moral or religious issues, which this is anyway.  That in and of itself is socialism.  Who are you to try and dictate what anyone does in their personal lives with their significant other and their children or would-be children.  Are you going to be there to support (physically, emotionally, and financially) the poor mother that you want to force to have that child when he or she is born into this world?  If not then sit down and shut up.  It&#8217;s none of your business.  By the way, the dirty Catholic church especially has no bearing here at all.  They have committed such atrocities throughout history they should be hiding in the shadows and praying for themselves.  Whatever they have to say about anything is not only irrelevant, but shows a complete lack of focus on what they really need to be focusing on, which is themselves.  They need to pull the plank out of their eyes before pointing out the spec in our society&#8217;s.</p>

                        <p>Not matter what all this rubbish above points to, the bottom line is that there is and certainly never will be a resolution to any problem as long as people are seeing the world only through the limited focus of whatever they think these two parties actually represents.  For crying out loud are there any independent thinkers out there????  Is the two party system simply a convenient way for idiots to simply fight about something that no one really understands and no one can really ever take care of?  Do you all really think that we can just simply fix all of this crap by only thinking about things in such a narrow minded and idiotic way of thinking.  Do you think some sort of God put all of us here to bicker about EVERYTHING in this manner?  Get out of your anthropocentric and stuck heads and REALLY, REALLY think about things!!!!!!!</p>

                        <p>I think we all need to go back to the saying &#8220;What would Jesus do&#8221;.  So what did he do?  He lived his life so as to provide us with an example of what it means to sacrifice self for the sake of another.  The total opposite of selfishness, he gave his whole self, even to the point of death.  So what is self-sacrifice?  Is it to take the easiest, most comfortable road possible?  Or- is it to take the road that that is the most difficult, most contrary to our human nature so as to do whatever possible to help our fellow man?   Maybe that is why many times the &#8220;right&#8221; decision seems so foreign to us, because it goes against our very nature to be comfortable.  So you decide.  Which is more difficult?  To have an abortion to &#8220;take care of a problem&#8221; or to give up our very lives for a totally separate, distinct life within us?  (The separate/distinct part is just a scientific fact.)  And are they really our bodies to begin with?  Don&#8217;t forget 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 &#8220;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?  For you have been purchased at a price.&#8221;   Let&#8217;s even go so far as to take the most horrific example- rape.  Can you imagine how difficult it would be for a woman who had been raped to carry a baby (conceived by rape) to term?  She would sacrifice everything for 9 whole months- to give up her life for this child within her- to allow God&#8217;s grace to take over and His will to be fulfilled- remember Romans 8:28?  &#8220;We know God causes ALL THINGS to work together for GOOD&#8221;.  Let&#8217;s face it- children are a blessing no matter how they are conceived (Psalm 127:3-5).  Who are we to put limits on God.  What is to stop God from taking a child conceived out of rape and making him someone great?  How do we have the right to snuff out this life simply because of the torture or embarrassment we would suffer?  We adopted one of our children and have no idea of the circumstances of his conception, but he has been nothing but a blessing to our family.  If he had been conceived by rape, we would not love him any less.  Let us not presume to know or understand the ways of God (Isaiah 55:8) &#8220;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the Lord.&#8221;  But let us instead ask his Holy Spirit to come into our hearts to teach us His way, His truth, and His life.  Let&#8217;s listen to the voice of the Lord as He spoke to Jeremiah (1:5) &#8220;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you.&#8221;  And even if you still aren&#8217;t convicted of this, just ask our Lord to write His truth in your heart- and He will.  So what would Jesus do?</p>

                        <p>It&#8217;s nice how you twist the words of the bible to fit this subject.  This subject is discussed nowhere in the bible, and furthermore, the point is that this is something that should be left between the person and God, not legislated by the government.  In fact, our wonderful God is not always so wonderful and self-sacrificing himself.  Just read Leviticus &#8211; he speaks about punishing people by death left and right (even innocent children of the wicked) &#8211; so don&#8217;t fool yourself into believing he is an advocate of every life out there.  That is a practically a fairy tale.  Do you really think if Roe v Wade were overturned that it would stop abortions?  Even if it is mandated by state if that happens, not all states will outlaw it, you can be sure of that.  And even if they did, it would be done illegally (and more horrifically God forbid) here still, or outside the country.  You and many like yourself out there have fooled yourselves into believing this is only a recent problem since it&#8217;s gained attention &#8211; abortion has been going on for longer than you think and everywhere on this earth &#8211; long before several of your ancestors were even born.  No matter what the legislation is in this country, you will never stop it &#8211; it will still be done either illegally or elsewhere.  You can do nothing about it, so it should be left out of politics where it belongs.  Besides, do you really think those conservative or republican politicians out there really care about abortion (they are even guilty of it themselves!)? They use it to manipulate you only for your vote.  You are just their naive little pawn.  Why is that every time a republican has been president since abortion was made legal they have done nothing about it to overturn that judgement?  They don&#8217;t care.  They just want your vote.  So this should no longer even be a political argument.</p>

                        <p>Homosexuals force gay marriage down our throat all the  time.  Leftists are mad that religion preserves decency because if people have no decency they can peddle their filth all they want.  Actually, society has stepped way over the boundary and enslaved itself with sex and egoism. People living with each other out of wedlock and having sex outside of marriage destroys the nucleus of society: the family.  The cultural revolution has pushed our soceity over a cliff, making people cold and indifferent, pursuing hedonistic pleasures with no regard for self or neighbor.  Jesus said that he destroyed the law through showing the Father&#8217;s love, but that not one letter of the law has been removed.  Looking to preserve society morals is not casting stones, it&#8217;s preserving the decency which allows love to flourish through helping each other, not taking the easy way out of erasing a life.</p>

                        <p>That still doesn&#8217;t change the fact that the right uses abortion only to steal your vote.  They don&#8217;t care, and they will never outlaw it, so people need to stop even considering this when they vote.  And your views on society morals should never be imposed on anyone through government.  Not everyone sees the world the way you do, and thus the country should not be run based on your view either.  That is offensive to everyone else&#8217;s values and morals out there that conflict with yours, no matter what they are.  Just because you don&#8217;t see it their way, it doesn&#8217;t make them wrong, or anti-Christian, and even if they were not Christian, it does not make them wrong or immoral human beings as you suggest.</p>

                        <p>There are many subjects not discussed specifically in the Bible, but I&#8217;m curious what does Jeremiah 1:5 mean to you? &#8220;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you.&#8221;  Abortion can no more be left between the person and God, than murder.  What about the 5th commandment &#8220;Thou shalt not kill?&#8221;  Or are you one of those people who argues abortion is not killing an actual person?  We have laws in place to protect people and there is no longer any debate that these unborn babies are people.<br />
     As for our God- Jesus died to accept the punishment for all our sins.  God no longer punishes &#8220;the wicked&#8221; on earth like He did in the Old Testament.  That is why you don&#8217;t find any of the stories in the New Testament like the ones in Leviticus.<br />
     I know if Roe vs. Wade were overturned it would no more stop abortions than laws against murder prevent drive by shootings.  The point is, if abortion is accepted by our society as a reasonable solution, we cannot expect God to bless our nation.  Luke 12:31 &#8220;Seek first His kingdom and these other things will be given you besides.&#8221;<br />
    You say abortion should be left out of politics, however, you are fighting to keep a law in place allowing it.  I encourage you to educate yourself before making your comments.  Actually, in 2002, President Bush signed the   Born Alive Infants Protection Act which reaffirms the legal principle that all infants born alive are entitled to the full protection of the law.  This came about because congress received testimony that some infants who had been born alive after unsuccessful abortions were left to die in the soiled linen closets.  Also in 2003, Bush signed the Partial- Birth Abortion Ban prohibiting the barbaric practice of abortionists where, the baby&#8217;s entire body is delivered except for the head.  The abortionist then jams scissors into the baby&#8217;s skull.  The scissors are then opened to enlarge the hole and removed.  A suction catheter is inserted to suck out the baby&#8217;s brains causing the skull to collapse.  The dead baby is then removed.  My&#8230; how far we have come as a society.  Obama has said, &#8220;The first thing I will do as President is sign the Freedom of Choice Act.&#8221; (FOCA)  FOCA would nullify all the protective legislature regulating the abortion industry including partial-birth abortion, the Infants Protection Act, parental consent laws, as well as waiting periods.  At least a Republican president would not take us back to these horrible practices.  Here is a quote from Mother Theresa which pretty much sums it up&#8230;<br />
&#8220;America needs no words from me to see how your decision in Roe v. Wade has deformed a great nation. The so-called right to abortion has pitted mothers against their children and women against men. It has sown violence and discord at the heart of the most intimate human relationships. It has aggravated the derogation of the father&#8217;s role in an increasingly fatherless society. It has portrayed the greatest of gifts &#8212; a child &#8212; as a competitor, an intrusion, and an inconvenience. It has nominally accorded mothers unfettered dominion over the independent lives of their physically dependent sons and daughters&#8221;<br />
And, in granting this unconscionable power, it has exposed many women to unjust and selfish demands from their husbands or other sexual partners. Human rights are not a privilege conferred by government. They are every human being&#8217;s entitlement by virtue of his humanity. The right to life does not depend, and must not be declared to be contingent, on the pleasure of anyone else, not even a parent or a sovereign.&#8221; (Mother Theresa &#8212; &#8220;Notable and Quotable,&#8221; Wall Street Journal, 2/25/94, p. A14)</p>

                        <p>You cannot claim that &#8220;the Church is not attempting to impose a moral code upon others&#8221; while it is attempting to coerce politicians into imposing that moral code, that&#8217;s disingenuous at best, and laughably dishonest at worst.</p>
<p>The cold fact of the matter is that when you are elected into Congress in the United States you swear an oath to uphold the Constitution.  You have an ethical obligation to uphold that oath, even should it conflict with your moral code.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the oath: </p>
<p>&#8220;I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since you add &#8220;God&#8221; at the end, you actually now also have a moral obligation to uphold that oath, or you&#8217;re taking the Lord&#8217;s name in vain&#8230; something that (cough cough) comes higher on the list than &#8220;thou shalt not kill&#8221;, no?</p>
<p>The question of whether or not abortion constitutes murder is a moral question, based upon a *theological* concept of when life begins.  It is therefore an imposition of a religious doctrine to ban abortion outright&#8230; this is forbidden by the establishment clause.</p>
<p>Therefore, you have a quandary, as a Catholic politician&#8230; you have an ethical and moral obligation to *not* vote to ban abortion, and a moral obligation *to* prevent abortion.</p>
<p>This is one instance where the duty and obligation of Congresspeople in the United States is (to my mind) absolutely clear; they cannot vote for a ban on abortion, either ethically or morally, but they are required to bear the consequence of that decision.</p>
<p>So, either don&#8217;t run for office as a Catholic, or accept the fact that you&#8217;re suspended from active participation in the Church while you serve, or go argue it out with the Pope.  </p>
<p>Burke is actively asking Catholic politicians to violate their oath of office, I&#8217;m surprised nobody has called him out on this.</p>

                        <p>It&#8217;s totaly amzing to me that some of you on here think that life exists only at birth.  I suppose that&#8217;s your way of justifying abortion.  In consideration of that thought process, then you aren&#8217;t killing anything.  The unborn is the most defenseless of the defenseless.  So all of you who are trying to compare abortion to collateral damage in wartime are just kidding yourselves.  It always amazes me that liberals always criticize the war (and these Islamo Fascists want us all dead) but are perfectly fine with abortion.  Not being judgmental as only our Creator reserves that right but I pray you all wake up before it&#8217;s too late.</p>

                        <p>[&#8230;] Obama Lied About His Abortion Voting Record During the Third Presidential Debate &#8211; An analysis of the third presidential debate shows that Obama lied about his legislative action on abortion. Obama Lie One:  Obama stated that the Born Alive Infant Protection Act &#8221;said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.&#8221;  Truth:  The legislation applied to babies that were born live, living completely outside their mothers&#8217; womb and no longer under any jurisdiction of Roe v. Wade. Obama Lie Two:  Obama stated, &#8220;And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.&#8221;  Truth:  Illinois abortion law to this day only protects babies that survive an abortion who the abortionist deems fit to live.  Obama opposed closing this loophole by voting against legislation to mandate a second doctor be present at deliveries of all babies born alive, in order to independently assess their viability.  Obama Lie Three:  &#8220;I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there&#8217;s an exception for the mother&#8217;s health and life, and this did not contain that exception.&#8221; Truth:  Note Obama&#8217;s slick use of the phrases &#8220;late term&#8221; and &#8220;partial birth&#8221; abortions when the issue is about babies &#8220;born alive&#8221; after a botched abortion.  Obama then starts talking about the &#8220;mother&#8217;s health and life&#8221; to deflect attention away from the live baby in need of health care to continue surviving.  In 2001, Obama was the only Illinois senator to speak out on the Senate floor against the bill that would provide health care to babies born alive after a botched abortion.  What kind of man is Obama who would do that, then lie, straight-faced, about what he had done? http://bornalivetruth.org/debate3.aspx  Vatican official attacks U.S. Democrats as &#8220;party of death&#8221; By Phil Stewart which exposes how the former St. Louis Archbishop Raymond Burk who is the head of the Vatican&#8217;s highest court, the Vatican&#8217;s Supreme Court of the Apostolic Signature, said that the Democratic Party risked &#8220;transforming itself definitively into a party of death for its decisions on bioethical issues.&#8221;  He then attacked two of the party&#8217;s most high profile Catholics — vice presidential candidate Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — for misrepresenting Church teaching on abortion.  Pope Benedict has been encouraging Catholic bishops to speak out more openly on public policy issues to make the Church&#8217;s voice heard. http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2008 &nbsp;/10/01/vatican-official-attacks-us-demo crats-as-party-of-dea&#8230;  [&#8230;]</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately in the Diocese of Stockton, California, USA, our bishop has pushed a pro-Democrat agenda on the Catholics of this diocese.  He recently stated<br />
  &#8220;&#8230;under the Democrats, there have been fewer abortions.&#8221;  That is not a truth. Actually, it is through the actions of a very positive, dedicated pro-life group (of all faiths) that abortions are down &#8211; not low enough,but still fewer. Through offering support to unwed mothers or mothers with unwanted pregnancies, that much of this has come about. The Catholic church in many communities is active in this effort. &#8211; But as I said, our bishop subscribes to the USCCB policies which, in the opinion of many of us Republicans and conservative Democrats falls short of what we are called to do as Christians.</p>

                        <p>The reason the number of surgical abortions is fewer is because of the availability of &#8220;chemical abortions&#8221; such as RU 486 or the &#8220;morning after pill&#8221;.  The actual number of abortions including surgical and chemical is estimated at an all time high- however there is no way to actually calculate it since women can now just take a pill.

                        <p>I find it truly amazing that this election is exposing the true colors of some spiritual leaders, and even the Vatican and Pope. I don&#8217;t think that the issues they are using to defamate the Democratic party leaders are necessary or acceptable. I am certain that the Lord is watching and taking notes, because He says,&#8221; 1. Judge not, that you be not judged. 2. For with what you judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measure back to you. 3. And why do you look at the speck in your brother&#8217;s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye? 4. Or how can you say to your brother,&#8217; Let me remove the speck from your eye; and look a plank is in your own eye? 5. Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother&#8217;s eye. 12. Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophet. 15. Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. 21. Not everyone who says to Me, &#8216;Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven ( The last time I checked, judging, is not doing The Father&#8217;s will. Only He can judge!) 22. Many will say to Me in that day,&#8217; Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name? 23. And then I will declare to them, &#8216; I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!&#8221; Matthew 7: 1-5, 12,15,21-23.</p>
<p>Thus, beware my Brothers and Sisters. Those who are voiceful and stakes claims at the expense of the Lord are not always doing His work, and the consequences that they will pay is unimaginable.</p>

                        <p>I agree with the Catholic church taking a stand on this abortion issue. Someone needs to stand up and it&#8217;s about time. Too bad the priests are afraid to get up on the pulpit and tell us like it is.  War is wrong, but we need to protect our children from attacks and be proactive, not hide and wait to be attacked by those who hate us and hate freedom. Voting Democratic right now is certainly going to limit our freedoms that we so love as we get ready for the world of socialism. Abortionists will no doubt be paid less for abortions since the government will be in control of health care, therefore, the less qualified physicians will be preforming these.  Maybe that&#8217;s a good thing.  More deaths to our nations youth and daughters in the name of socialism.  Less and less doctors will be available to perform these, because their pay rates will be controlled by the government and there is not a lot of money are praise to doctors who are supposed to pledge &#8220;First do no harm&#8221; before they are given docter privileges.  We need to protect our girls from evil.  Abortion is an evil act.  If you have had an abortion and feel great about it there is something wrong with you. It&#8217;s great to say it&#8217;s no big deal, but the truth is there are walking wounded out there who have suffered due to an abortion.  I believe having pro-life candidates is a FOR SURE sign to try and fix the flaws of abortion rights. One of these candidates has a downsyndrome child.  Could this be a sign from God that we better listen as Catholics and we better stop picking and chosing what we like most about being Catholic.  Will they reverse the rules on abortion?  Most likely not, but I do hope and pray then when I turn my Republican vote in that they will start putting up major restrictions and or abolish this act together.  It scares me that my daughter can go with out my knowledge and obtain an abortion as young as 15.<br />
Girls can get an abortion without mom or dad knowing it as long as they can scrape up the money.  They are using abortion as a birth control method. Planned Parenthood would like you to think that they are doing all they can to prevent abortions with counseling, but this is just not true. Abortion is not birth control but it sure is being used as such.  Girls are immature and just trying to get out of an unplanned pregnancy so they don&#8217;t have to face mom and dad. What about the boy&#8217;s family?  They are left completely out of the picture.  Let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s big business at the expense of our American population. Now, if my daughter was raped and became pregnant it would be difficult for me to have her go through with the pregnancy, however the child is not evil- the act is.  I am not sure what I would do because this child is my own relative and not a frog to be squashed without some thought.  However, the majority of abortions are not the result of rape or incest.  This is my potential grandchild missing.  Who could this person have been?  These children may be adopted- and our current adoption policies indeed are so messed up, Americans would rather adopt from China than here.  That&#8217;s another issue.  The laws need to be revamped to help these American women who deep down would like to keep their baby or see it adopted and feel good about doing the right thing, but cannot afford it.  I would happily pay taxes to support this.  I guess my point is, abortion is being used as birth control by girls behind their mother&#8217;s backs for girls between the ages of 15-20.  Abortion just encourages irresponsability and way to get out of being stupid. This is wrong. What is happening to our country when a girl can go and do this without the counsel of a caring adult?  Obama thinks its cool that they have a choice and openly ADMITS it.  If our president thinks abortion is cool, him (Obama) being the biggest role model of the country, then why are we surprised that our youth are so messed up? They need to look up to someone who has morals. By the way if you are treated in the hospital shortly after a rape, pregnancy can be prevented with proper care.  Inner city girls are getting abortions because they are not being parented or lack parents, or any type of proper sex education, or encouraged to keep themselves safe by not having sex at all.  The public school system needs to encourage purity for the sake of these girls, put counselors in place in high schools so they can be helped.  These are our future adults and mothers.  We simply are too busy and too accepting of abortion as the status quo and have closed our eyes. We should be protecting our future population and the mental health of our girls of this country.  As a Catholic this is obvious to me.  We need to protect our American daughters not only from an unwanted pregnancy, but from the spread of disease. But no, this would be too moral and God like. God wants us to be happy, which is why purity is in the Bible and taught in religion class.  I would like to think that He encourages purity because he does not want to see the spirit suffer from the mental anguish that occurs shortly after the abortion or many years later, when these girls marry and have see their baby&#8217;s faces and wonder&#8230;what have I done?  Our youth need our help.  Catholic adults voting for Obama are committing a sin and voting for EVIL.  Our nation&#8217;s children should come first which is why I WHOLEHEARTEDLY agree and am warmed by this Bishops comments. These children of ours need to be counseled which our country severely lacks because we have taken God out of our schools, listened to the liberal agenda serving the needs of sinners. The 10 commandments are a general unknown to our youth unless parents are actively talking their children about what is right and what is wrong. Something to think about when you vote for a someone so for abortion as Obama is and WHOLEHEARTED endorses killing a baby that has unbelievably survived a botched abortion.  I guess he doesn&#8217;t care if his daughters decide to engage in this behind his back.  He is a senator first and a father second and supposedly has no problem with his daughter being on an abortion table. Now, we are paying the price for all the murderous abortions with our failed economy.  It&#8217;s all about money and that&#8217;s how God is trying to get our attention. God is watching.  Do you care?</p>

We cannot elect politicians who are Catholics, and approve of abortion, assisted suicide, or emboyonic stem-cell research.  They are wrong!  I am disturbed that Obama got elected, us knowing he is pro-abortion.  They should ALL be denied Communion &#8211; it would be a sacriledge for them to receive.

                        <p>How a politician can claim to be a person of faith, Catholic or otherwise, then support anything pro choice is beyond me. If only one day we&#8217;d have a politician that won&#8217;t sacrifice values and beliefs for the sake of political expedience&#8230;but then I guess they wouldn&#8217;t be called a politician.</p>

                        <p>This is pretty laughable considering that it is coming from the Roman Catholic Church; the church that repressed the Jesuits, the church responsible for the Crusades and attacks on citizens of Jerusalem, and countless early popes who were interested in not much more than extending their power reach, extending the religious empire, and in the case of at least one pope, debauching a virgin girl.</p>
<p>The Vatican ought o be more concerned with how to compensate the thousands of modern day victims of a cult of clergy that seems to be addicted to the supple flesh of young boys&#8230;..</p>

                        <p>Time to remove the tax exempt status of the Catholic Church which is clearly a political organization. as for purveyors of death the Church has killed hundreds of thousands during its existence and would consign a mother to her death even if a an abortion could save her life. The Church with its thousand so pedophiles many of whom still lurk within its ranks has no moral high ground to preach to the  world its so-called moral views as if they have any meaning whatsoever. better to clean up the Church&#8217;s act before sallying into morality.</p>

                        <p>A public figure who repeatedly &#038; consistently spits in the face of a critical Church doctrine like abortion should be denied communion.<br />
In face, why do they attend Mass at all if they reject the Church&#8217;s teachings ??<br />
Sadly, like the Mafia figures in years past these politico types donate so much to the collections that Priests will turn a blind eye to them.<br />
If Pelosi &#038; Biden want to support abortion that&#8217;s fine, I do not at all begrudge them to take that stand.<br />
But that means they cannot morally call themselves Catholic.</p>
