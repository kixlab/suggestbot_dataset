      <h2 align="center"><strong>THE INQUISITION: A Study in Absolute Catholic 
        Power </strong></h2>
      <p><strong>"And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and 
        with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered 
        with great admiration." {Revelation 17:6}</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Those who classify themselves as Christians can be divided into 
        2 broad groups: those who have chosen to allow the Bible to be their final 
        authority and those who have chosen to allow men to be their final authority. 
        For sake of simplicity, I shall refer to the first group as "Bible believing 
        Christians." The latter group has always been best represented by Roman 
        Catholicism, by far its largest, most powerful, and most influential component. 
        The Roman Catholic hierarchy has always boldly stated that it is not dependent 
        upon Scripture alone, but also accepts tradition as another pillar of 
        truth -- and where a conflict exists, tradition receives the greater acceptance. 
        Being its own arbiter of what is to be accepted as truth, it accepts no 
        authority as being higher than itself. This explains why the Catholic 
        belief system has been constantly evolving over the centuries. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>This also explains why a fierce antagonism has always existed 
        between Bible believing Christianity and Roman Catholicism. Rome's frequent 
        spiritual innovations excites the passions of Bible believers, who react 
        adversely to religious modifications that are at odds with the eternal, 
        changeless Word of God. Harboring a supreme confidence in the Book, a 
        trust which reflects their trust in the Holy Spirit who authored the Scriptures, 
        the Bible believers boldly challenge the suppositions of the Catholic 
        hierarchy. In the course of this spiritual warfare, Catholic people are 
        frequently converted from trust in Rome's complex religious system to 
        a childlike faith in the Savior and a simple reliance on His Word. Many 
        such converts ultimately leave the Church of Rome to join local, New Testament 
        churches. Frequently in history, the trickle of individuals who were making 
        this remarkable transformation turned into a flood. Such ruptures cannot 
        go unchecked by the Catholic hierarchy. As with any bureaucracy, its primary 
        interest is its own protection and propagation. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>The nature of its response to the inroads made by spiritual challengers 
        is dictated by its cultural surroundings. The more Catholic the culture, 
        the more severe the response. In past centuries, when Rome's ecclesiastical 
        power was virtually absolute throughout Europe, the intensity of the attacks 
        by the papists upon their spiritual enemies could be equally absolute. 
        Ignoring the injunction of II Corinthians 10:4 ("For the weapons of our 
        warfare are not carnal..."), Catholicism built its own philosophical system 
        to justify the use of carnal (fleshly, human, physical) means to achieve 
        spiritual ends. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Having divorced herself from Biblical absolutes, Catholicism 
        adopted a theology in which she sees herself as the church founded upon 
        the Apostle Peter by Jesus Christ, and alone empowered to bring salvation 
        to the world. Further, she believes herself assigned the daunting task 
        of bringing Christ's kingdom to fruition on earth. With those dogmas forming 
        her philosophical foundation, she seeks her power in the political sphere 
        as well as the religious realm. To whatever degree she achieves political 
        power, to that degree she feels compelled to use her secular influence 
        as a weapon against her spiritual adversaries. Thus, down through the 
        centuries, we see that in those countries in which Catholicism had achieved 
        absolute power, the pope's followers have not hesitated to brutally subdue 
        the enemies of "the Church". Although Jews, Moslems, pagans, and others 
        have felt the wrath of Rome, her special fury has always been reserved 
        for her bitterest and most effective challengers -- Bible believing Christians. 
        Only as the political climate changed in recent centuries did the Catholic 
        hierarchy see it expedient to change tactics and appear to be more tolerant. 
        Yet, to this day we see persecution continuing in those places on the 
        globe dominated by Catholicism. The degree of the persecution is determined 
        by the degree of control.</strong></p>
      <p><strong> To what lengths is the Catholic hierarchy prepared to go in 
        its drive to repress opposition and achieve its goal of instituting the 
        kingdom of Christ on earth? To find the answer, one must look to the pages 
        of history.</strong></p>
      <p><strong> When the Roman Catholic Church was founded by the pagan Roman 
        Emperor Constantine at the Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D., it immediately 
        achieved expansive influence at all levels of the imperial government. 
        As Bible believing Christians separated themselves from the Church of 
        Rome, which they saw as apostate, they represented a formidable potential 
        threat to the official new imperial religion. Persecution in varying degrees 
        of severity was instituted over the centuries following.</strong></p>
      <p><strong> By the 11th century, in their zeal to establish Christ's kingdom, 
        the Roman popes ("pope" is an ecclesiastical office that is the very antithesis 
        of the New Testament ideal of a local church pastor) began utilizing a 
        new tool -- the Crusades. At first, the Crusades had as their object the 
        conquering of Jerusalem and the "Holy Land". Along the crusaders' paths, 
        thousands of innocent civilians (especially Jews) were raped, robbed, 
        and slaughtered. In time, however, the crusade concept was altered to 
        crush spiritual opposition within Europe itself. In other words, armies 
        were raised with the intent of massacring whole communities of Bible believing 
        Christians. One such group of Bible believing Christians were known as 
        the Albigenses.</strong></p>
      <p><strong> [Pope] Innocent III believed that Bible believing dissidents 
        were worse than infidels (Saracens, Moslems, and Turks), for they threatened 
        the unity of ... Europe. So Innocent III sponsored 4 "crusades" to exterminate 
        the Albigenses. Innocent (what a name!) called upon Louis VII to do his 
        killing for him, and he also enjoined Raymond VI to assist him. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>The Cistercian order of Catholic monks were then commissioned 
        to preach all over France, Flanders, and Germany for the purpose of raising 
        an army sufficient to kill the Bible believers. All who volunteered to 
        take part in these mass murders were promised that they would receive 
        the same reward as those who had sallied forth against the Moslems (i.e., 
        forgiveness of sins and eternal life). </strong></p>
      <p><strong>The Albigenses were referred to in Pope Innocent's Sunday morning 
        messages as "servants of the old serpent". Innocent promised the killers 
        a heavenly kingdom if they took up their swords against unarmed populaces.</strong></p>
      <p><strong> In July of 1209 A.D. an army of orthodox Catholics attacked 
        Beziers and murdered 60,000 unarmed civilians, killing men, women, and 
        children. The whole city was sacked, and when someone complained that 
        Catholics were being killed as well as "heretics", the papal legates told 
        them to go on killing and not to worry about it for "the Lord knows His 
        own." </strong></p>
      <p><strong>At Minerve, 14,000 Christians were put to death in the flames, 
        and ears, noses, and lips of the "heretics" were cut off by the "faithful."(A)</strong></p>
      <p><strong> This is but one example from the long and sordid history of 
        Catholic atrocities committed against their bitter enemies, the Bible 
        believing Christians. Much worse treatment of Bible believers was forthcoming 
        during that stage of bloody Catholic history known as the Inquisition.</strong></p>
      <p><strong> It is vital, though, that we here define what is meant by the 
        term "heretic". According to Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary, 
        this is a heretic: "One who holds or advocates controversial opinions, 
        esp. one who publicly opposes the officially accepted dogma of the Roman 
        Catholic, Church." Or, as one author has put it, "Heresy, to a Catholic, 
        is anti-Catholic truth found in the Bible."(B) Another summarized the 
        official stance as this: "Every citizen in the empire was required to 
        be a Roman Catholic. Failure to give wholehearted allegiance to the pope 
        was considered treason against the state punishable by death."(C) </strong></p>
      <p><strong>From 1200 to 1500 the long series of Papal ordinances on the 
        Inquisition, ever increasing in severity and cruelty, and their whole 
        policy towards heresy, runs on without a break. It is a rigidly consistent 
        system of legislation: every Pope confirms and improves upon the devices 
        of his predecessor. All is directed to the one end, of completely uprooting 
        every difference of belief... The Inquisition ... contradicted the simplest 
        principles of Christian justice and love to our neighbor, and would have 
        been rejected with universal horror in the ancient Church.(D) </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Pope Alexander IV established the Office of the Inquisition within 
        Italy in 1254. The first inquisitor was Dominic, a Spaniard who was the 
        founder of the Dominican order of monks. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>The Inquisition was purely and uniquely a Catholic institution; 
        it was founded far the express purpose of exterminating every human being 
        in Europe who differed from Roman Catholic beliefs and practices. It spread 
        out from France, Milan, Geneva, Aragon, and Sardinia to Poland (14th century) 
        and then to Bohemia and Rome (1543). It was not abolished in Spain until 
        1820.(E)</strong></p>
      <p><strong> The Inquisition was a terrifying fact of life to those who lived 
        in areas where it was in force. That domain would eventually include not 
        only much of Europe, but also the far-flung colonies of Europe's Catholic 
        powers. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>The Inquisition, led by the Dominicans and the Jesuits, was usually 
        early on the scene following each territorial acquisition of the Spanish 
        and Portuguese empires in the 16th and 17th centuries. The methods used, 
        which all too often were similar to those used by Serra in California 
        or the Nazi-backed Ustashis in Croatia, sowed the seeds of reaction and 
        aversion that have proved to be a barrier for true missionaries ever since. 
        </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Albert Close writes of the Jesuit mission to Indonesia in 1559 
        that "conversion was wonderfully shortened by the cooperation of the colonial 
        governors whose militia offered' the natives the choice of the musket 
        ball or of baptism." </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Everywhere it existed, the "Holy Office" of the Inquisition spread 
        its tentacles of fear. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>When an inquisitor arrived in an area he called for reports of 
        anyone suspected of heresy, sometimes offering rewards to spies who would 
        report suspected heretics. Those suspected were imprisoned to await trials. 
        The trials were held in secret and the inquisitor acted as judge, prosecutor, 
        and jury. The accused had no lawyer. It was often simpler to confess to 
        heresy than to defend oneself, especially since torture was often employed 
        until the accused was ready to confess. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Because church and state had not been kept separate, the church 
        powers could call upon the government to use its power against the convicted 
        heretics. Anyone who fell back into heresy after repentance was turned 
        over by the Inquisition to the regular government to be put to death. 
        Most of those condemned to death were burned at the stake, but some were 
        beaten to death or drowned.</strong></p>
      <p><strong> The Inquisition was called the sanctum officium (Holy Office) 
        because the church considered its work so praiseworthy.(F)</strong></p>
      <p><strong> Even after the death of a victim, his punishment was not ended. 
        The property of condemned heretics was confiscated, leaving his family 
        in poverty. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>It is important here to emphasize Rome's role in the brutality 
        of the Inquisition. Roman Catholic apologists are quick to point out that 
        it was the state that put heretics to death. This is an alibi meant to 
        excuse the Vatican's role in the atrocities. However, Dollinger, the leading 
        19th century Catholic historian, stated: "The binding force of the laws 
        against heretics lay not in the authority of secular princes, but in the 
        sovereign dominion of life and death over all Christians claimed by the 
        Popes as God's representatives on earth, as [Pope] Innocent III expressly 
        states it."(G)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>In other words, the secular arm of the state acted only as it 
        was pressured to do so by the popes. Even kings who hesitated to commit 
        genocide on their own populaces were spurred into action by their fear 
        of papal excommunication or subversive Catholic activities within their 
        kingdoms. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Dollinger continues: "It was the Popes who compelled bishops 
        and priests to condemn the heterodox to torture, confiscation of their 
        goods, imprisonment, and death, and to enforce the execution of this sentence 
        on the civil authorities, under pain of excommunication,"(H)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Will Durant informs us that in 1521 Leo X issued the bull Honestis 
        which "ordered the excommunication of any officials, and the suspension 
        of religious services in any community, that refused to execute, without 
        examination or revision, the sentences of the inquisitors." Consider Clement 
        V's rebuke of King Edward II: "We hear that you forbid torture as contrary 
        to the laws of your land. But no state law can override canon law, our 
        law. Therefore I command you at once to submit those men to torture.(I)</strong></p>
      <p><strong> The methods used by the Inquisition ranged from the barbaric 
        to the bizarre. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>When the inquisitors swept into a town an "Edict of Faith" was 
        issued requiring everyone to reveal any heresy of which they had knowledge. 
        Those who concealed a heretic came under the curse of the Church and the 
        inquisitors' wrath. Informants would approach the inquisitors' lodgings 
        under cover of night and were rewarded for information. No one arrested 
        was ever acquitted. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Torture was considered to be essential because the church felt 
        duty-bound to identify from the lips of the victims themselves any deviance 
        from sound doctrine. Presumably, the more excruciating the torture, the 
        more likely that the truth could be wrung from reluctant lips. The inquisitors 
        were determined that it was "better for a hundred innocent people to die 
        than for one heretic to go free". </strong></p>
      <p><strong>"Heretics" were committed to the flames because the popes believed 
        the Bible forbade Christians to shed blood. The victims of the Inquisition 
        exceeded by hundreds of thousands the number of Christians and Jews who 
        had suffered under pagan Roman emperors.(J) </strong></p>
      <p><strong>This wanton slaughter of innocent people was justified by Catholic 
        theologians such as "Saint". Thomas Aquinas, who said, "If forgers and 
        other malefactors are put to death by the secular power, there is much 
        more reason for putting to death one convicted of heresy." In 1815, Comte 
        Le Maistre defended the Inquisition by advocating: "The Inquisition is, 
        in its very nature, good, mild, and preservative. It is the universal, 
        indelible character of every ecclesiastical institution; you see it in 
        Rome, and you can see it wherever the true Church has power."(K) Such 
        a viewpoint could only be expressed by one so brainwashed as to think 
        that the cruel, torturous deaths of dissidents to Catholicism is preferable 
        to the survival and propagation of those who would challenge the Vatican's 
        authority. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Yet, not all Romanists have been comfortable with the totalitarian 
        nature of their "church". Even Jean Antoine Llorente, secretary to the 
        Spanish Inquisition from 1790-92, was to admit: "The horrid conduct of 
        this Holy Office weakened the power and diminished the population of Spain 
        by arresting the progress of arts, sciences, industry, and commerce, and 
        by compelling multitudes of families to abandon the kingdom; by instigating 
        the expulsion of the Jews and the Moors, and by immolating on its flaming 
        shambles more than 300,000 victims."(L) Historian Will Durant stated, 
        "Compared with the persecution of heresy in Europe from 1227 to 1492, 
        the persecution of Christians by Romans in the first 3 centuries after 
        Christ was a mild and humane procedure. Making every allowance required 
        by an historian and permitted to a Christian, we must rank the Inquisition, 
        along with the wars and persecutions of our time, as among the darkest 
        blots on the record of mankind, revealing a ferocity unknown in any beast."(M)</strong></p>
      <p><strong> Catholic apologists attempt to downplay the significance of 
        the Inquisition, saying that relatively few people were ever directly 
        affected. While controversy rages around the number of victims that can 
        be claimed by the Inquisition, conservative estimates easily place the 
        count in the millions. This does not include the equally vast numbers 
        of human beings slaughtered in the various wars and other conflicts instigated 
        over the centuries by Vatican political intrigues. Nor does it take it 
        account the Holocaust wrought upon the Jews by the Nazis, led by Roman 
        Catholics who used their own religious history to justify their modern 
        excesses. As one secular history explains, "As the Germans instituted 
        a bureaucracy of organized murder, so too did Torquemada, the first Grand 
        Inquisitor, a worthy of predecessor of Heydrich and Eichmann."(N) </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Because her basic doctrinal premises remain in place, Rome can 
        yet again rise up against her spiritual enemies at some future date when 
        she again wields exclusive ecclesiastical control of a region. In fact, 
        the "Holy Office" of the Inquisition still exists within the Vatican (known 
        today as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith), awaiting the 
        day in which it can stamp out "heresy". As recently as 1938, a popular 
        Catholic weekly declared: </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Heresy is an awful crime against God, and those who start a heresy 
        are more guilty than they who are traitors to the civil government. If 
        the state has a right to punish treason with death, the principle is the 
        same that concedes to the spiritual authority the power of life and death 
        over the archtraitor.(O) </strong></p>
      <p><strong>The Inquisition proved how Catholicism will react when it has 
        possession of absolute power. Is it any wonder that in the 1880s, Dr. 
        H. Grattan Guinness preached the following: </strong></p>
      <p><strong>I see the great Apostasy, I see the desolation of Christendom, 
        I see the smoking ruins, I see the reign of monsters; I see those vice-gods, 
        that Gregory VII, that Innocent III, that Boniface Vlll, that Alexander 
        Vl, that Gregory XIII, that Pius IX; I see their long succession, I hear 
        their insufferable blasphemies, I see their abominable lives; I see them 
        worshipped by blinded generations, bestowing hollow benedictions, bartering 
        away worthless promises of heaven; I see their liveried slaves, their 
        shaven priests, their celibate confessors; I see the infamous confessional, 
        the ruined women, the murdered innocents; I hear the lying absolutions, 
        the dying groans; I hear the cries of the victims; I hear the anathemas, 
        the curses, the thunders of the interdicts; I see the racks, the dungeons, 
        the stakes; I see that inhuman Inquisition, those fires of Smithfield, 
        those butcheries of St. Bartholomew, that Spanish Armada, those unspeakable 
        dragonnades, that endless train of wars, that dreadful multitude of massacres. 
        I see it all, and in the name of the ruin it has brought in the Church 
        and in the world, in the name of the truth it has denied, the temple it 
        has defiled, the God it has blasphemed, the souls it has destroyed; in 
        the name of the millions it has deluded, the millions it has slaughtered, 
        the millions it has damned; with holy confessors, with noble reformers, 
        with innumerable martyrs, with the saints of ages, I denounce it as the 
        masterpiece of Satan, as the body and soul and essence of antichrist."(P) 
        </strong></p>
      <p><strong>The challenge I give to Bible believing Christians is to respect 
        the heritage we have been given by those who suffered for Biblical truth, 
        that we may be prepared to suffer ourselves. Ours is the generation that 
        may yet again be afflicted for the faith once delivered to the saints. 
        If such is to be our privilege, let us face our trials with this promise 
        of our Lord fresh upon our hearts: "Blessed are they which are persecuted 
        for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." {Matthew 
        5:10} </strong></p>
      <p><strong>The challenge I give to Roman Catholics is to take up the New 
        Testament of the Bible and allow the Holy Spirit of God to speak to your 
        hearts. If a Catholic remains skeptical about this brief treatise on the 
        Inquisition, he is certainly welcome to examine for himself the record 
        of history. If he remains unmoved by my conclusions, he is welcome to 
        draw his own. But of far greater import is his need to examine the teachings 
        of his church in the light of God's Word. Jesus leaves you with this warning:</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>"He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one 
        that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him 
        in the last day." {John 12:48} </strong></p>
      <p><strong>You to whom the Bible was so accessible will not be able to plead 
        ignorance in that terrible day of judgment. </strong></p>
