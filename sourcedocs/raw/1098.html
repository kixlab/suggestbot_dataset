                            <p>According to the <a href="http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/nationwide-trends" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Institute on Drug Abuse,</a> marijuana is the most commonly used illegal drug in America (marijuana is "illegal" in the sense that it is a <a href="https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/Possession-Controlled-Substance.htm">controlled substance</a> under federal law, with no recognized legitimate value). Despite the federal classification, some states have passed medical marijuana laws permitting possession under certain circumstances; and some state laws have decriminalized marijuana, making possession of small amounts punishable by fines or treated as infractions, rather than as crimes that carry potential jail sentences.</p>
<p>But in all states, it is still a violation of federal law to possess marijuana. This conflict may someday be resolved by federal legislation that allows for specified, legal uses, but for now, federal and state law are often at odds with each other, as discussed below.</p>
<p>To get information in your state regarding marijuana laws, jump ahead to the section on <a href="https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/marijuana-possession.htm#states">marijuana laws by state</a>.</p>
<h2>Primary Factors Affecting Punishment</h2>
<p>If you have been arrested for possession of marijuana, the key factors that will affect the outcome of your case are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>State or federal jurisdiction. </strong>Were you arrested by federal or state law enforcement officials? If you were arrested for possession by state law enforcement, you will need to review your state&rsquo;s laws. If you were arrested by federal law enforcement, most likely you were targeted for arrest because your possession was in connection with other violations such as <a href="https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/drug-trafficking.htm">drug trafficking</a>, large scale grow operations, ties to criminal enterprises, or violent activities or unlawful possession of firearms. Under <a href="https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/felony-drug-possession.htm">federal law</a>, possession by itself is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison and up to $1,000 fine for a first offense. When possession is tied with sale or other criminal enterprises, federal penalties are much harsher and categorized as felonies. Federal prosecutors may also prosecute as marijuana crimes conduct that is legal under a state&rsquo;s law. This is not common, but the rise in <a href="https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/topics/medical-marijuana-laws">medical marijuana laws</a> has prompted the federal government to periodically reevaluate its enforcement policies.</p>
<p><strong>Legalization.</strong> In five states -- Alaska, Colorado, Washington D.C., Oregon, and Washington -- possession by adults of small amounts for personal use is completely legal under state law.</p>
<p><strong>Decriminalization. </strong>Other states have classified possession of small amounts as an infraction, including California, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, and Ohio. An infraction is a minor violation akin to a traffic ticket; typically, violators are subject only to a small fine and first time offenders usually have no criminal record. In states that have decriminalized marijuana, offenders receive citations but they are not arrested unless they possess large amounts or are repeat offenders.</p>
<p>State laws on marijuana change frequently. For more information, see the <a href="http://norml.org/aboutmarijuana/item/states-that-have-decriminalized" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decriminalization page on NORML</a>, the organization that advocates for marijuana reform.</p>
<p><strong>How much? </strong>Punishment for marijuana possession typically varies according to the quantity of marijuana possessed. Possession of marijuana almost always constitutes a felony rather than a misdemeanor when the quantity is large enough to indicate that it is held for sale rather than for personal use. In almost all states, possession of amounts greater than one kilogram can result in felony offenses, which carry a much more significant penalty. These felony charges can also include the growing, cultivation, manufacturing or sale of marijuana or marijuana drug paraphernalia.</p>
<p><strong>Medical marijuana</strong>. A surprising number of states have allowed for possession and use of specified quantities of marijuana, or its derivatives. Some states' programs are not yet operational; other states (Texas and Louisiana) require a physician to prescribe marijuana, which is not legal under federal law. For a complete listing of medical marijuana states, see the <a href="http://norml.org/legal/medical-marijuana-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">chart on the NORML medical marijuana page</a>.</p>
<h2>Other Factors Enhancing Punishment</h2>
<p>Certain additional factors may affect the punishment for possession. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a previous criminal record or is this a second or third offense for possession?</li>
<li>Did you sell or give marijuana to minors, or were you arrested for possession near a school, public park or similar community locale? In some states, this may results in enhanced punishment.</li>
<li>Was the arrest made in connection with a driving infraction? Many states have DUID (driving under the influence of drugs) laws that include marijuana. See <a href="/resources/criminal-defense/dui-and-dwi-charges/marijuana-dui-laws.htm">Driving Under the Influence of Marijuana</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Was the possession for plants or harvested marijuana? State laws may differ as to punishment regarding possession of plants versus possession of cut marijuana.</li>
<li>Did you have drug paraphernalia? State laws differ as to the legality of drug paraphernalia such as pipes, scales, bongs, or other devices.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Marijuana Possession Penalties</h2>
<p>For those charged with personal possession of marijuana (not for resale or distribution), where decriminalization does not apply, a misdemeanor possession charge will be lowest for first offenders. In situations where the charge is based on sales of drug paraphernalia, the penalties can be increased to a felony. Depending on the factors listed above, the penalties for possession can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a fine (typically up to $2,000)</li>
<li>jail time (typically less than one year in jail)</li>
<li>mandatory drug testing</li>
<li>drug awareness classes</li>
<li>probation, and</li>
<li>electronic monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Marijuana Possession Sentencing</h2>
<p>Although possession of marijuana is typically not considered as serious as possessing other types of drugs or controlled substances, judges have sometimes imposed fairly stiff sentences even on first time offenders. As noted, the individual's age, prior convictions and overall standing in the community are typically taken into consideration. For those that have a driver's license, suspension of the license can also occur and may be ordered by judges. An attorney can assist in minimizing the sentence by working with the prosecuting attorney to plea bargain or agree to a treatment program rather than a conviction.</p>
