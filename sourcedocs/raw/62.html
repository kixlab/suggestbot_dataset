  <p>Prospective adoptive parents should consult an attorney for legal advice 
    and as they prepare to adopt a child. You can read about some of the legal 
    aspects of adoption here. <strong><i>Please note that this is not legal advice 
    for your particular situation.</i></strong></p>
  <h1><a  name="_Toc33512224"></a>The Legal Aspects of Adoption</h1>
  <h1><a  name="_Toc33512225">Selecting an Attorney</a></h1>
  <p>Federal and state laws that apply to foster care and adoption require certain 
    steps to be followed prior to the finalization of an adoption. It is important 
    to have an attorney to represent you in the adoption process. Your family, 
    friends or individuals you know who have adopted may be able to recommend 
    an attorney for legal advice and you can find out more information on attorneys 
    from your local county Bar Association. Sometimes it is helpful for an attorney 
    to have knowledge of the foster care system. </p>
  <h1><a  name="_Toc33512226">Attorney Fees</a></h1>
  <p>Attorney fees vary around the state. You will need to ask the attorney what 
    fees they charge and how they bill their services. Since some children are 
    eligible for an adoption subsidy (a one-time reimbursement of legal fees or 
    non-recurring adoption expenses with a maximum expenditure of $1500 per child) 
    your attorney may be able to assist you in applying the subsidy to their fees. 
  </p>
  <h1><a  name="_Toc33512227">Approval</a></h1>
  <p>Prospective adoptive parents need an approved Family Preparation Assessment 
    (Home Study) to be recommended for a child who is a ward. Your local county 
    Office of Family and Children (OFC) and/or the private agency (LCPA) that 
    contracts with the county must determine if you have been approved. You are 
    required to have written approval before a child can be placed with you for 
    adoption and through your local court jurisdiction. </p>
  <h1><a  name="_Toc33512228">Agency Supervision</a></h1>
  <p>Indiana law requires that adoptions be granted only after a period of supervision 
    has been met. A local County Office of Family and Children (OFC) or private 
    child placing agency (LCPA) that contracts with them must supervise the child 
    and adoptive family relationship. The length of the supervision period is 
    at the discretion of the court, however most courts require a standard time 
    period of six months. </p>
  <h1><a  name="_Toc33512229">Required Consents</a></h1>
  <p>The consent of the child's mother, if she is living, is required by law to 
    complete an adoption. The consent of a child's father who has established 
    paternity or signed a paternity affidavit is also required. The county Office 
    of Family and Children (OFC) may have completed a court action to terminate 
    the parent-child relationship so that a child who is a ward can be legally 
    free for adoption, whether the child's parents have consented or not determines 
    the type of court action that is necessary. Your attorney should check with 
    the OFC to see whether all consents have been obtained or determine if the 
    child is legally free for adoption. You will need the consent of the OFC that 
    has the responsibility of care and supervision of the child you wish to adopt 
    for the court proceedings, unless the court finds that their consent is not 
    necessary to serve the best interests of the child.</p>
  <h1><a  name="_Toc33512230">Adoption Petition Filing</a></h1>
  <p>If you are an Indiana resident, you may file your adoption petition in the 
    county where you reside, in the county where the child resides, or in the 
    county where the private agency (LCPA) or Office of Family and Children (OFC) 
    has custody of the child. If you are not an Indiana resident, you may petition 
    to adopt a child who is a ward of Indiana in the county where the LCPA or 
    OFC has custody or the county where the child resides. </p>
  <p> If you are married, both you and your spouse must sign the adoption petition. 
    Partners of an unmarried couple may not petition to adopt together and in 
    such cases, only one partner may be the petitioner.</p>
  <h1><a  name="_Toc33512231">Adoption Filing Fees</a></h1>
  <p>The adoption filing fee consists of the following: The adoption history 
    fee, which is $20 and the putative father registry fee, which is $50, both 
    of these fees are sent to the State Department of Health for records maintenance; 
    and the county clerk's office fee, which is $100. The court may not require 
    payment of the clerk's fee if you are unable to pay it based on an affidavit 
    regarding your income and expenses.</p>
  <h1><a  name="_Toc33512232">Adoption Assistance</a></h1>
  <p>Some of the children in the Indiana Adoption Program are eligible for the 
    Federal Adoption Assistance Program. This can provide a monthly payment and 
    Medicaid for the child after adoption. The child's social worker or your attorney 
    can help you apply for the adoption assistance program. If adoption assistance 
    is denied, you may request an administrative appeal and at the hearing, you 
    may choose to represent yourself or have your attorney represent you. If adoption 
    assistance is granted, you may choose to enter into a contractual agreement 
    with the Office of Family and Children to receive the assistance, which requires 
    periodic certification. The assistance may continue until the adopted child 
    reaches the age of 18 and may be extended to age 21 if the OFC determines 
    that your child's physical, mental or emotional disabilities warrant an extension. 
    The assistance must be requested in your adoption petition and is ordered 
    by the court.</p>
  <h1><a  name="_Toc33512233">County Adoption Subsidy</a></h1>
  <p>Adoption assistance may be available through the county OFC for families 
    adopting some children with special needs. County subsidy may include a monetary 
    payment and reimbursement for medical and related expenses due to a pre-existing 
    physical, mental or emotional condition of the child. County subsidy cannot 
    be denied on the basis of your income. The subsidy must be requested in your 
    adoption petition and is ordered by the court. A child may be eligible to 
    receive both adoption assistance and county subsidy.</p>
