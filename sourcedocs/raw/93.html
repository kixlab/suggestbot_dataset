<p>Abort73 touched my heart because I was a pregnant 17 year old in 1973 and I was offered an abortion as a solution. I said No. That kid born in 1973 is now a responsible husband and father of 4 children of his own. I'm pretty sure he is glad he was born. I know I am!</p>

<p>Abort73 is one of the best sites I've come across.  I didn't read the entire site, but I hope you've also covered info about the morning after pills.  I'd like info about the reasons women give for later-term abortion as well.</p>

<p>Abort73 is extremely informative with detailed facts that can be backed up. It shows truth with compassion for the women involved in abortion. The facts regarding abortion are easier to prove than I knew. The pro-choice side has no medical, political or spiritual basis for being correct.

<p>Your reasons are skewed and your information is irresponsible. You assume a correlation between child abuse and legalization of abortion. Child abuse has always been prevalent—only in the last 50 years has maltreatment of children received attention. Also, regarding more minorities having abortions and implying that is genocide.  Perhaps fewer people of color have good access or money to spend on birth control. Maybe more minorities cannot afford to feed another mouth due to socioeconomic factors. To imply selective abortion based on race is irresponsible.</p>

<p>Abort73 is a great resource. The information appears well-researched and even-headed. The only criticism I can make is that in your pages you do not report the fact that abortion and infanticide have been a plight since the beginning of humankind. To be fair you do imply it in the historical pages, but don't appear to address the issue further... Thank you again for your public service. I want to do more to advance the pro-life cause and I pray for the day when the rights of the unborn will be respected.</p>

<p>I do not agree with your position on tubal pregnancy.  No matter what the situation, taking a life is morally wrong.  As you know, it is not always fatal for the mother & in some cases not fatal to the child. If death for the child occurs, it must occur naturally. If a child is dying of malnutrition, where it is too late to intervene, should we kill the child because death is inevitable?</p>

I think such a graphic would make an interesting point.</p>

<p>(Abort73 is) Pretty one-sided. The fact that you think abortion is never the answer means you don't understand how <a href="http://www.abort73.com/end_abortion/is_abortion_ever_justified/">pregnancy can endanger the life of a mother</a>, nor do you empathize with children who would be born so malformed that they'd live short lives full of pain. Plus, <a href="http://www.abort73.com/end_abortion/how_will_we_care_for_the_extra_children/">you don't seem to have a plan</a> for what we as a society would do with 800,000+ babies that would be born every year if abortion were not an option. As someone who works with kids in the foster care system, I find that to be critically shortsighted.</p>

They REALLY lash out at those who support life'!! To me, it sound like they're using their anger to suppress their guilt! [Back in high school], because of going to public schools with VERY liberal teachers... , I became pretty liberal. When my cousin came to me and told me that she was pregnant by her boyfriend, who she hardly knew, I tried to talk her into getting an abortion! I told her that having a baby would ruin her future... THANK GOD, SHE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME and decided to keep the baby! ... After her healthy baby boy was born, and I saw him and held him for the first time, I began to feel SO guilty... Since then, my eyes have been opened, and I have been against abortion!!!</p>

<p>After looking at your website, I find it an absolute disgrace that you are making women and young girls feel ashamed for having abortions. How dare any of you inflict your harsh, insensitive and outright ignorant views on abortion and how 'wrong' it is? You have no idea on what circumstances surround women who find themselves to be pregnant. These ridiculous comparisons and opinions on abortion only make females who have been through it feel guilty and wrong for doing what they have done. Clearly this website has been created by self-righteous and deluded people who have nothing better to do than make others feel ashamed and guilty about such a sensitive and tough thing for a girl to do.

<p>I have always been against abortion, and I think every child has the right to life&#8212;no matter what. At school, I am working on a argument essay about why abortion is wrong, but  when I shared my opinion at school some class mates made me unsure if abortion was completely wrong. While I was trying to find some research I came to this website. After reading some articles, I became confident that abortion is wrong and had no doubt about it.</p>

<p>(Abort73 is) nonsense&#8212;filled with lies and misleading.

If freedom has any meaning at all, every woman should be allowed to make her own decision as to what she wishes.

<p>(Through Abort73,) I have learned how to respond to more sophisticated pro-choice arguments such as those advanced by Nathan Nobis. There is, however, a limit to how far we can permeate. At the end of the day I realize that opposition to abortion is ultimately rooted in presuppositions that transcend the secular realm. Thus it is important to bring the atheistic pro-choice person who also supports infanticide or sees no value in human life to a belief in God before we can have a chance to convince him/her of the immorality of abortion. In short, the abortion debate encompasses more than just abortion.</p>

I understand your case against it and never would I condone myself or anyone I know to receive an abortion but I still believe it should remain legal.</p>

<p>I respect the (Abort73) website.  While I do not support abortion as a common form of birth control, I do see a use for the procedure from a medical point of view in specific cases, and therefore feel it should remain legal.  Further, I respect and support your website as a source of information for pregnant women seeking answers concerning abortion, especially in a case that falls out the realm I above described.  Overall, the website is a way to communicate the point of view without harassing women and subjecting your point of view to those not interested, so I actually support it.  And you do truly seem to seek dialogue and conversation rather than scare tactics and politics, which I respect and appreciate.</p>

<p>Very impressed by [Abort73] overall.  I feel like I can go to one site and get almost any question answered in a clear and logical way.  Most sites come primarily from a religious angle to try to argue against abortion.  Although that's OK, and I share their view completely, the world can then easily dismiss those "religious nuts."  With all the technology and scientific and biological evidence that's available now, it is crucial to present that side of it to an unbelieving world.  Thank you for doing that. I will be recommending this site in the future.</p>

<p>I am a youth pastor that has been looking for a relevant source of info and ideas for presenting a Biblical view of abortion to my youth group.  I was amazed at how little they knew about the subject and was able to quickly fill the void with just a fraction of the info on your site.  I consider our study on abortion a massive success as the students seemed to be emblazoned to stand up for life and to stand against abortion. They lit up Facebook all night passing links to the site along to their friends. I am also confident that they are in the halls of their school this morning passing out cards on the websites behalf as well as the message of letting life live.

<p>I have always been very against abortion, but before visiting Abort73, I'm not sure how well I could have argued my position to a pro-choice friend. Now I know what I believe about preborn life, and I know WHY I believe it. I know how to argue what I know is true. I have learned so much and am constantly shocked, saddened, and DRIVEN by the statistics on Abort73. This is by far my favorite pro-life website. The information is overwelming. Many essays and reports have benefited from the excelent points and reliable statisitcs you give! I also apreciate the links to other pro-life organizations and sites, some of which I have been able to get involved with and may not have found if not for you!
	My favorite thing about this website is how... friendly it is... as in, not the least bit dull and boring. It's well formatted, and very modern looking. It grabs your attention and keeps it. Plus, it looks very "teen"... and I'm sure a large percentage of your visiters are teens.
	I have ordered 5 shirts from you and more for my friends, who LOVE them! I was impressed by how fast even a very large order arrived. I LOVE that the shirts are comfortable and totally cute, and that they fit well. They come in great colors! Most importantly for me, I feel like I'm on a mission when I'm wearing an Abort73 shirt... like people are watching. I believe when I wear the shirts, it's my responsibility to be informed about the issue of abortion and ready to explain the meaning and reason for the shirt whenever someone asks. I usually carry the cards around too, just in case. I also really appreciate the idea that one slogan isn't going to change someone's mind, and the logic of pointing them to the site. That makes a lot of sense!
	I am so impressed with Abort73.com, I talk about it to my frinds all the time and I highly reccomend it! Thank you for the awesome work you do!I am praying that you will grow and continue to be successful in reaching many men and women. The videos you put out are also powerful and compelling. GREAT JOB!

Also the section on personhood and the common objections...really helped me solidify my belief that this is SO VERY WRONG. Excellent ministry you have here. Cannot say enough good things.</p>

<p>I always felt I was "pro choice" in the sense that abortion would never be right for me, but if that's the choice others around me made, I would respect it. I now feel I could never condone this act of violence, and my heart is breaking for all these babies who were "discarded" in this unmerciful, cruel way. It was beautiful to read how the fetus forms from the moment of conception through to birth. I guess I never really thought of a baby as a baby when it's in the blastocyst stage. I feel relief now for standing up to my husband and family when they told me I had too abort my fifth child. He's a happy, 11-week old, thriving baby now, and I thank God I have him everyday.

<p>I would have actually described abortion as a "severe injustice."  However, I have never actively promoted this belief or done anything to try to change the hearts or minds of those who support the legal right to abortion in the US (except for debating the topic with such people, including my own family and significant other, and occasionally, passively passing along information that support my beliefs to my friends). Stumbling on [the Abort73] website and exploring the information available has compelled me to do a lot more research on my own and fueled my longtime belief - my gut instinct -  that abortion is inhumane. I will do anything I can to learn more about this problem and what can be done. I also appreciate that this site is not dripping with Christian-based sentiment. As a non-Christian (though I hold many fundamental Christian values), I feel that, in general, constantly intertwining religious views with moral beliefs does not sit well with most non-Christians who are in need of convincing.  I'm glad that [Abort73] seems someone recognizes this.</p>

<p>I love [Abort73]. Invaluable resource. I have a T-shirt I wear on my college campus, and I love how it sparks discussions with people. You guys are fantastic. I love the name, too! If people could tell from the shirt that it is pro-life they might never say something to me. But because it is ambiguous, they approach me and we have constructive dialogue. One thing that is particularly useful to me is the medical testimony about where life begins. I've used those quotes countless times. I've also learned a lot about the racial discrimination of abortion, and the perverse roots/intent of Planned Parenthood.</p>

<p>I appreciate [Abort73's] emphasis on human rights as opposed to religious objections to abortion, which many find easy to dismiss. It was helpful to see sound secular arguments, which I had not previously given a lot of thought to. I didn't realize that many abortion clinics were for profit. I had also never seen a concise, non-dramatized presentation of what actually happens during an abortion. Opinions are articulately expressed and drawn from a wide variety of resources; it upholds a pro-life stance without scare tactics and provides practical arguments against abortions legality. </p>

<p>This is the best pro-life website I have visited -- in fact, it may be one of the best "cause" websites I've seen. The first things I see when the home page appears are 2- and 5-minute videos succinctly explaining the pro-life case for the unborn. This is a perfect design, because short visuals are the best way to communicate your message in a hyper-visual culture. The second things are noticed were the five reasons for pro-life at the bottom of the home page. Clicking the first one brings up a compelling yet brief argument, which is then followed up by a possible objection, which is then answered by the next article. I love how each article ends with a possible objection from the prochoice side and then a link to the pro-life rebuttal. Each well-crafted argument invigorates my mind and makes me want to read more. These pages are addicting -- I keep on clicking the links at the bottom! I absolutely love the format and the way the case for the unborn is unfolded. I am planning a pro-life tract and this website will definitely be my main source and structure. You guys should really be commended for creating such a superb site for a superb cause.</p>

<p>I once believed that while abortion was wrong, it could not be made illegal because that would be to legislate morality, and you cannot make people believe as you do. By reading the articles on this site, however, I have come to see that while people cannot be made to change, to do nothing about it is just as wrong as doing the act yourself. People cannot be allowed to just do whatever they want. Should we make all murder legal then, because some people will do it anyway? No. We have a moral obligation, as the human race, to mete out justice. And letting people make the choice to abort their children is just dead wrong.</p>

Had I been given something like this to see (that my child had a beating heart), I would not of had done it. There should have been a different approach, one more realistic. Let [women] see their child, let them know their defenseless baby will feel the pain when he/she is being sucked out of the womb. I never wanted to look back, but karma has a way of letting us know just what it was that we did!

<p>Abort73 is a great site... I chose abortion over thirty years ago. I did NOT have this type of readily-available information to help me stay firm in my beliefs, and I killed a child. This site, Abort73, will be of tremendous service to the unborn and their parents.</p>

<p>Visiting Abort73 has rekindled the passion to fight for the weak in our world, those who cannot protect themselves.  I also have gained new understanding and compassion on how many fall prey to fear and pressure, believing that abortion will end their problems. The testimonies have impacted me greatly as well as the brutally clear photos.</p>

<p>The thing that really got to me were the graphic abortion photos! I learned that the importance of graphic abortion images is to help communicate what words, alone, often cannot!!! Your guys' photos did that exactly. I had no idea how bad it really was. I thought the embryo's body just shriveled up and passed through the mothers uterus... boy was I oh so very wrong and off!!! Thank you so much. That was quite an eye opener for me!!!</p>

I've printed out several fliers and taped them to the rail outside of the closest abortion mill on their killing day. I would like to get some signs and t-shirts soon, when I have a little bit more cash flow!</p>

<p>Finding this website has totally re-invigorated my fight against abortion. Before I found it, I felt helpless, and like we were never getting anywhere with voting and laws alone. This opened my eyes to a whole new way of reaching people. I have been posting and posting using my Facebook account, to hopefully reach more and more people. Your videos are well done and educational without being preachy or condemning. Thanks for putting so much effort into gathering all the FACTS in one easy to use place. It is a wonderful resource and I am using it. I am wearing the shirts, the arm band, put a link on my blog, and just ordered the bumper sticker for my car, and cards to give to people who ask questions (I have already had a few!).</p>

<p>My thoughts on abortion have really been developed and shaped by the information I've found on Abort73 and sites like it. My stance on the issue is more clarified and clear now... I was always pro-life, but never really knew how to explain my position with sound knowledge, and I knew I couldn't simply rely on my Christian faith (so many people just don't care about what God has to say). Abort73 really helped me have information on just what it was I stood for, and now any chance I get, I tell my friends about what I've learned. I often wish I was a biology teacher and could teach youth about this stuff! Thanks for you're hard work and hours of researching and updating. Keep it up, and God bless your work.</p>

I think the best way to help pro-choice people understand, or even convert to the pro-life position (or at least have an open mind about it) is by simply giving the facts and exposing truths.  Using reputable sources and updated information is important.  And I like how the website is appealing to people who aren't religious too.  You don't have to be religious to be pro-life.  Your site also targets young people, which I think is important.  I know WAY TOO MANY people who are pro-choice out of ignorance.  IGNORANCE IS MURDER. Way to go Abort73!!!</p>

<p>I love the [approach] of Abort73. I do not believe that the government should be able to control what we do or do not do with our own bodies, but I believe that anything can be prevented through education. I remember in my Family Life class in middle school, whenever someone asked any of us what we would do if we got pregnant, we would just simply state abortion. No one knew anything about the process and its morals; it just seemed like a mystical alternative to taking care of a baby. Then, in the eighth grade, we were assigned a research paper that could be on anything we wanted it to be. Because I knew little about the subject of abortion, I chose that topic. At the beginning of that paper, I was completely pro-abortion. But when I presented my project to the class a few months later, I had completely changed my view on the subject. And after presenting to my class, many of friends went up to me and told me that I had changed their opinions of abortion too! I am so glad that Abort73 is here to let everyone know the facts about abortion. Hopefully through this campaign, many lives will be saved.</p>

<p>I had an abortion at 18, and I've never for a moment regretted that decision or second-guessed the wisdom of it. I suppose that makes me a monster according this website's worldview, which mocks the idea that a women could have an abortion because they care about being the best mother they possibly could be, and wouldn't want to bring another human being into the world without doing everything in their power to provide the best life possible for him or her. I don't understand how people could be so blind to these nuanced but honest reasons. Its because I care about children and being a good mother that I would rather 'kill' something that had the possibility of becoming a child while it is still a tiny clump of cells than have a child I wouldn't be able to care for the way it would deserve, or abandon it to the vagaries of the adoption system where I would have no idea of how it could be raised. </p>

<p>My view on abortion has been strongly influenced. I always have believed that abortion is always the wrong choice, but this website puts even more into perspective and it shocks me to see how bad it really can be. I never thought I could be more against abortion before... but now... I'm way more against it than I was.</p>

<p>I have always believed firmly that abortion was wrong, but I had been struggling with the morality and even viability of working to outlaw it... the job of the government isn't to legislate morality. People have free will, and with it, a right to make even wrong choices. They'll be the worse off for it, but they can't be stopped from sinning. We can't completely outlaw smoking, or jumping off bridges, or insults. These are all bad things, but to make them criminal would be illegal. And so I had put abortion into this category of things that we can't legislate for other people, and I was affected by the arguments that outlawing abortion would only cause women to seek dangerous illegal abortions in Mexico or someplace. But this site argued the case against abortion in such a clear, rational way... completely free of the fanaticism and slogans and repetition I've winced at in other pro-life stances. [It showed me that] it is okay and even necessary to outlaw things that cross the line of hurting another person... My previous stance seems so weak... This is the best pro-life site I've ever seen. I saw that the issue with illegal abortions has been addressed on this site, to my pleasant surprise, and of course the arguments I already knew are discussed as soundly as I've ever seen them.</p>

<p>Primarily emotive, subjective vomit combined with thinly disguised opinion masquerading as medical 'fact', especially the evidence cited in defense of your claims that "individual human life begins at fertilization". The section of your site that infuriated me the most was the area dealing with the morality of abortion in regard to rape victims. Again premised on the (subjective) assumption that life begins at conception, surely even ignorant individuals such as yourselves cannot truly think that a few examples of anecdotal evidence represents the majority of rape victims.</p>

<p>It is an informative site. But in all reality the world is becoming a horrible place and is hard enough to survive and get by without a child. If a couple feels they would not be able to provide for a child or give it the life it deserves there is nothing wrong with abortion if you plan on waiting to a later date and learning from your mistake. Although it should be done fairly soon before 7 weeks I would say.</p>

<p>I think your site looks very enticing and yet you rely on old data to give the appearance that your site relies on new research. Your site also manipulates data to support your agenda using "data" that has been poorly executed and purposely misleading. This is unfortunate as well as scientifically reprehensible. I have been searching to find a pro-life site or even pro-life research studies that rely on very current science (past 6-10 years) to make its point and can find none. Instead, all I find are sites that mix very old data with a tiny amount of "newish" data in an attempt to skew the real results of the research. Your site does this as does every single anti-choice site.</p>

<p>[Abort73] is Wonderful! As a mother of 2 boys with severe autism there are many in the autism community that want to locate a detectable gene that can be found on prenatal tests so parents can be informed of the likelihood of their unborn child being autistic.  This angers me because truly parents who chose to abort these children have no idea of the love and beauty that can be found through a child effected by autism.

Then I saw the video on Abort73.com's home page and I realized that I hadn't cared before because I hadn't SEEN abortion. I'd seen poverty, starvation, slavery, persecution, but I'd never seen abortion. That video has literally changed my life.

I always believed it was wrong and should be illegal, but all I did was vote against it. I care about this issue so much more than I did before and I don't believe that it is just a political issue. It's a matter of life and death.</p>

<p>I've learned that there are many more abortions performed than I thought. And too many in my county, and not enough education for the girls/women who have them done. I am a Naturopath, and a Health Professional, I educate people all the time. Even if the information isn't "pleasing", the truth needs to be told, and you are doing a great job! Thank you!</p>

<p>Abort73.com has a hip marketing feel for the pro-life cause. I like that it doesn't seem to bring Catholocism into it (no-offense to Catholics; they are the front-runners to the pro-life cause) and just gives the facts without trying to be P.C. in anyway. We've already tried it their way and it didn't work. Abort73.com is rational and uses science and History to support their argument.</p>

<p>I think this website is excellently designed and offers a multitude of valuable information presented in an attractive, teenager-friendly way. I endorse this website because it also explores the complexity of issues faced by pro-life individuals. It is a website that offers knowledge, insight, and support for people of all walks of life. This website challenges the stereotypes about anti abortionists set by the pro-choice movement. While it is clear that the website has some religious themes, it is designed to appeal to non-religious individuals like myself. I commend the authors of this website for a job well done. Thank you for standing up for people like me, and all of the innocent victims of abortion! You are truly amazing people and I am happy to know that stuff like this exists!

<p>Last week I spoke about abortion to a group of about 80 kids, 7th-12th grade. I played one of your videos (the medical testimony one) and at the end of the event I told everyone to go to your website for more info. The most powerful thing, some of the kids told me, was when I read about the abortion procedures. One girl in particular said she used to think it wasn't her place to say if it was wrong for others to have an abortion, but after hearing what abortion really is, she now realizes it's just wrong. Period.

<p>I agree with everything that Abort73 stands for. Abortion hurts me so deeply. I am 19 and just gave birth to my son six months ago. I look at him and I see a perfectly formed human being and my heart just aches when I think about my "choice" to have killed him. I never even considered it an option but so many do, because it's "the easy way out". But it's not the easy way, it's the hardest. One of my best friends, who is very pro-choice once said to me, "I love my right to choose. I don't want the governments hands on my body." But the government already has it's hands on her body by legalizing abortion, convincing her that it's okay to murder her own child. Abortion is murder. There shouldn't have to be a "choice". Your website is a beautiful testament to life.

<p>I love your website and ministry. I just stumbled upon it shortly ago in Wikipedia. I was updating my own website (<a href="http://www.beavoiceforthevoiceless.com" target="_blank">www.beavoiceforthevoiceless.com</a> ), which focuses on approaching animal rights, human rights (including abortion), and caring for the earth from a Christian perspective. Basically, a Consistent Life Ethic that respect all of God's creation. I have had the site for going on a year now, and had a hard time finding a good pro-life movement to endorse. I find that the popular ones are run by what seems to be an older generation, that is very mad, in-your-face, and alienating to the very people they're trying to reach out to. I have always wanted to get involved in the pro-life movement, and feel I finally found an organization I can be proud to endorse... I like the fresh, approachable feel of your website and ministry. Please let me know how I can get involved.

<p>As a Christian in college, I have to deal with abortion issues in classroom and personal settings. With numerous websites, it has become difficult to separate fact from fiction when looking for resources. However, Abort73 offers an easily navigable website, with interesting and accurate information. It addresses most every issue that arises in pro-life vs. pro-choice discussions and defenses. I highly recommend this website to anyone wanting to better educate themselves on the facts of abortion. Abort73 provides a plethora of useful resources to help anyone become active in speaking for the unborn children. As a result, I can take a stand, knowing that I do so with solid facts. This website has greatly inspired and aided my desire and duty to take action against abortion. I strongly hope and pray that the recommendation of this site to others will yield the same results.</p>

I visited this website because I was writing a paper about [abortion], and I was letting my mother proof-read it afterwords, and she broke down. She told me that before me, she had an abortion. She told me that there was not a day that went by that she didn't think about her baby and regretted it. Seeing that firsthand I now see that most women don't really know what they are going to do and if they did that they would never do it. Your website is out there with the truth, no sugarcoating and I think its awesome because it shows abortion for what it really is... murder.</p>

<p>I've actually gone back and forth over the years over whether I was pro-choice or not. I think I've always settled with the feeling that although abortion was not for me, I had no right to push my opinions on someone else, since none of us walk in the same shoes... But now I feel that instead of killing that precious little one, there need to be multiple choices a woman or girl can find, very easily, to give her a choice besides abortion. Your website offers rational, non-judgmental answers to some very real questions about whether or not an abortion is the solution a woman should seek in the case of an accidental pregnancy.</p>

This site reminds me that abortion is wrong, no matter how you look at it, and it's the assurance I need when I'm confused, unsure, and complacent.</p>

And if mothers could see this before they got an abortion, they would probably think again. It is just inhumane. I don't know what else to say, I am just so upset. But thank you for putting the reality out there where it can be seen for a change. I just couldn't watch it further or I might have nightmares.</p>

<p>I was 12 years old when my mother died, in 1951, from and illegal abortion performed by a medical technician in St. Louis, Mo. I did not find out the truth of her death until this year, when I am 69 years old. It makes me terribly sad. I ended up being raised by two loving aunts, and no one told me the truth about my mother's death--I happened to find out about it on the internet, by accident. It was very shocking! I guess I am lucky to be alive. I consider abortion an abomination! I think she could have found a way to have the baby and, at worst, offer it up for adoption. Her choice was harmful to many people--even her daughter at the age of 69! It makes me terribly sad.</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever heard my pastors speak of abortion. I've just bought 10 <em>A Biblical Mandate To Do Something Against Abortion</em> books and one will go to each of them. I've already read through the whole book, as has my older brother and his girl friend... it's well written and brings up a lot of evidence to prove that God does want us to do something against it. I wear Abort73.com T-shirts almost every day and I do have people ask me about them... almost all of my friends are now pro-life from being pro-choice or not having any idea.</p>

Eating is the only thing that keeps me from feeling so sick. I felt so horrible today, as if this thing growing inside me was just taking my life force from me to live, and yet I don't even want it... Anyways, after I read these testimonies and watched the abortion video I knew that all I was doing if I chose to abort was moving away from God's will, and possibly even His blessing for my partner and I.

<p>I love how your main goal isn't merely to make abortion illegal but it's to change the way people think-to affect the lives of the girls who struggle with whether to get an abortion or not. It makes much more sense to educate people and change their minds than to just change a law. I also really liked what was said about abortion in reference to disabilities and how you don't just kill off children with disabilities, etc. that are already born.</p>

Several of my friends at school, and even random people in public wanted to know how and where to get them.

<p>The truth is, I was raised baptist, but I did everything I wasnt supposed to do. So technically I have been pro-life for a long time without even giving it real consideration.

I want to do anything and everything I can to stop this from happening. I think what you guys are doing here is great. I completely support it and I have plans on sharing my testimony.

<p>Before seeing this website I was never undecided on whether abortion was right, or wrong. In the eyes of my God, it is wrong, and in my eyes it can never be right, but sometimes, I thought abortion may be accepted, some people may be doing the 'right thing' and making a 'better choice'. I'm a med student in the UK, in my second year of university. Abortion is a topic which is not widely studied in the medical profession, only by those who choose to specialize in gynecology, or related medical fields. And no where in any medical text book that Oxford has thrown at us does it show such images of abortion and the apparent reckless damage it inflicts upon the foetus. I thank you very much for giving me a chance to see how these extremely young lives are ended... you're doing an amazing thing allowing people to see how cruel the worlds most evolutionary species can be.</p>

<p>I never realized exactly how an abortion was achieved. I always thought that the baby was sucked out through a tube and it was painless for both the baby and the mother. I also didn't realize that a baby could be terminated so late into pregnancy (the last image on the video). I thought anything more than about 12 weeks would not be allowed. Because I do remember hearing that if a premature baby is 22 weeks old or more the doctors are meant to try and save it, and yet it is ok to kill a 22, 23 or 24 week old baby?! I always thought it was wrong to abort a more developed baby, but now I know how old some babies actually are when they are aborted.</p>

Then one day I decided to do some research and came across videos, information on techniques performed, and so on, and I was astonished. It's truly a devastation and makes me stomach churn in agony to watch. Keep up the good work. I'm going to post this link to my MySpace to try to get people to recognize the horrors as well.

I am thankful for sites like this that help others to talk to this young women and show them that there is hope, and that there is a life inside of them...</p>

<p>My whole life I've always said that abortion is ok. I've always thought that if a woman gets raped and gets pregnant that abortion would be the way to go. But now, after looking at these pictures, I don't believe that anymore. I don't see how a person could kill a 22 week old baby. The baby has little hands and little feet and can feel and it can smell with its little nose. It's not a fully developed person yet, but it is a person... I appreciate these pictures being on the web to see. I think that if more people looked at them, it would change their mind about abortion.</p>

<p>I was considering abortion when I got pregnant at 14, but I decided not to get one. I just had my beautiful baby boy 5 weeks ago. He's the best. I am going to keep him and raise him and teach him biblical teachings. I am glad you made this site, I think that abortion is wrong. It should not even be a thought in anyone's head, but sadly it's more then just a thought, its' a reality.</p>

As I watched the videos on your website my eyes were opened again. I can not imgaine seeing these things and not being effected by them. What hurt me the most when I saw them though was that abortion was something I had thought about. When i considered what would happen if i got pregnant at this time I thought the only thing that would be okay for me and the guy I was involvoed with would be abortion.

You can murder someone and get put in jail for it but you can take an unborn baby's life and get away with it? It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

Was it relief from making my parents happy? Probably. I'm 24 now and have a 3 year old. I love her so much as any mum would. She was not planned either. But I look at her and cry sometimes, knowing I've stopped someone being born... Why is it when you're young, people give you one side to the story? If I had known how big my baby was at the time, and had an ultrasound etc, I really feel this would have changed my mind. But this isn't what every around me wanted me to hear...</p>

<p>I have encountered so many people who thought abortion was just about removing tissue. I used to be one of them. Then one day someone handed me a pamphlet with a picture of an aborted fetus and I was so shocked to find out that abortion is NOT the removal of tissue. It is actually the killing of a living human being. If it weren't for people like you who tell the truth about abortion, I
would've continued to support it AND probably had one myself. Is it really giving a woman a choice if you're not telling her the
truth about what her choices are? I can't understand how it's legal for abortion clinics to provide abortions without it being mandatory for them to show #1 an ultrasound of their baby, and #2 a demonstration and/or a video of the abortion method. How is it that "a medical procedure," as pro-choicers like to call it, is performed without adequately informing women what they are doing? Isn't that lying? I have 2 children and am on the WIC program (Women Infant Children) They give free education and vouchers for food for families and one of their rules is that you MUST watch a video about breast-feeding before you
can receive your vouchers. When I get a medical exam, everything that is going to be done to me is explained in detail and I am given information packets on the procedure with pictures and everything. Smokers are told the risks of smoking and even shown pictures of cancerous lungs so that they know exactly what it is they're doing. The point is, it is normally REQUIRED to tell and show someone exactly what they are doing before they do it. Yet it is not the same with abortion. I don't get that. If I hadn't seen a picture of an aborted child that was handed to me by a pro-lifer, I might've gotten an abortion thinking that what I was doing was simply removing a lifeless lump. By withholding information from me, I wasn't given an opportunity to make a real choice. By withholding information, I was being deceived. Pro-choice people are actually Anti-choice because they won't show pictures of aborted fetuses. They hide the truth from people who WOULDN'T get an abortion if they had only known what the truth was. I
thank people like you who DO show these pictures and educate people on what abortion really is. If it wasn't for people like you, I might've been deceived by society into killing my baby. Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>This website motivated me a great deal to start doing a whole lot more in my community to fight this atrocity. It also gave me great knowledge and a renewed mindset that help me to be more assertive about what I know to be right. Every time I have a conversation with someone about abortion, no matter what they believe, I direct them here.  I tell them, if they're pro choice, then what do they have to lose? It will either give them insight into the argument against abortion so that they can better argue their side, or, what I truly believe will happen, it will change their mind. If the person is pro life, then its time to do something about this, and this website can help. Pro-life is my calling by God and this website has made my work so much easier. Thank you so much for this!!</p>

<p>Today two of my high school teachers, my girlfriend and me were just talking and I brought up Abort73 to them and they asked me about it... we had a really interesting conversation about our beliefs and what we think is OK and not OK, but what got to me the most is that GOD came up in our talk and it was great to be able too talk about such a problem-starting subject and be cool about it with no arguments and even get to talk about GOD! I tell a lot of people about you and the site and a lot of people have got your back on supporting abort73 and I just thank you for the inspiration! You have helped bring me closer to GOD and to stand out for what's right!</p>

<p>I put some of the abort73 DVDs in the college care packages that our church sends out annually. A young female who is not walking with the Lord was a recipient. She had just found out that she was pregnant and was considering an abortion until she saw the DVD that was in the box. She did not watch it, but she was aware enough that that would be a wrong choice just by seeing the cover and being reminded of what she already knew.</p>

<p>I work at a group home with 14 boys. One of the staff explained abortion to them from the pro-choice stand point and had them vote on weather or not it should be illegal. Only 11 voted. 9 voted that abortion should be legal and 2 that it should be illegal. After that I
ordered the <a href="../HTML/V-E-DVD.html">Abortion Unfiltered DVD</a> from you guys. I showed it to them and 8 voted that abortion should be illegal in all situations and it is murder. 4 voted that it depends on the situation. 2 were not present... God Bless Your Ministry! It is so easy to change peoples minds with this, we just need more effort.</p>

<p>When I first found this website I was doing a debate project for school on abortions. I used so much of the sites' information and won the debate. I remember that I couldn't show the videos to my classmates because they were graphic but many of them went on this site to see for themselves and ended up in tears, even the guys. Many of the kids in that class who used to be pro-choice switched to pro-life after they heard my debate and saw the videos. I would like to thank everyone who put their time into this website. I will never EVER consider an abortion and I will never let anyone I know get one before they see this site.</p>

<p>To begin I must thank you for the truth-filled informative and compassionate ministry of Abort73.com... I've had with numerous
conversations (8 so far) with people about the meaning of "Abortion Unfiltered" and the meaning of "Abort73." Each of those ended in providing a solid (thanks to your ministry website) case for the full humanity of the unborn. Two of those cases resulted in recently pregnant teens aborting their previous decision to abort their unborn babies! Thank you again for standing amidst the crowds of our uninformed culture and providing the truth on abortion in a gracious, even-handed manner with all honor and glory to Christ.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago I had to do a presentation on abortion. I did a search and found your site. At that point, I didn't really have a stand on abortion... I guess I always thought it didn't really matter either way, even though I have been raised with the belief that God knows a child from the womb. I think that your site is absolutely amazing. I feel that it is an extremely important cause, and I'm glad that you took the time to put it together. The doctors tried to convince my mother to have an abortion when she was pregnant with my older brother. They said he would be retarded... Well, my mom decided to keep him, and he's a genius. No deformities at all... Aside from the ones a sister may see. Anyway, just a note to say I think you rock!</p>

<p>I've been prolife for as far back as I can remember, but until recently, I only based my opinion on the fact that I'm Christian and
Christians are supposed to be prolife. I appreciate that this website helped me to expand my knowledge on all aspects of why abortion is wrong and enabled to me effectively communicate that to others. The last time I was on this website, I was sharing my beliefs with a pro-choice, very liberal, friend and showing her around the website. Ten minutes after discussing my reasons for being prolife, I took a pregnancy test, which came back positive. At the time, I was unmarried, a freshman in college, and am only 18 years old. Needless to say, this pregnancy was not anywhere close to being planned. I thank God for your website and that he gave me the opportunity to get my facts straight and solid just before facing the biggest change of my life.

I was in tears... the kind where you don't even have to blink for them to fall. I knew I could never, in a million years, kill an unborn, innocent child. On February 3rd, 2006, I had the most precious beautiful baby boy in the world. He means everything to me and my life has changed in many ways, for the better. Of course there is the feedings in the middle of the night and the stinky diapers, but I would much rather do those things hundreds of times a day for a couple years then to think that I killed my son for the rest of my life. Thank you abort73 for opening up my eyes and showing me that even two months
after fertilization... there is a growing human being just waiting to come out. Thank you so much for saving the love of my life from the most disturbing and unnatural act anyone could do... abortion.</p>

<p>I was listening to a radio talk show yesterday, when a caller called in and requested that listeners go to this web site. Just out of
curiosity, I came here. I have always been pro-choice and couldn't believe that the Governor of SD wants to outlaw all abortions. I have always been completely against partial firth abortions though, and always thought that a woman should do it in the first trimester. After seeing the photos, I am in shock! I am 28 years old, with 2 children, a 2-year-old and 9-year-old. My mother was trying to terrify me, and pressure me into getting an abortion when I was 18. Instead, I chose to move out and be on my own. Call me ignorant, but I, like many others, thought that a baby in the first trimester was like the size of a cell, too little to even see. Well, that's what the pictures have always looked like in the doc's offices! I am sitting here now, a changed woman... The images of those tiny little babies will stay with me forever. Why aren't mothers shown these things while waiting at the office to
get their abortions? I could go on and on........like I said, I am in shock!</p>

this site, abort73.com. It is the first place I have found accurate and I believe, real, photographic images of aborted fetuses anywhere. Ever... I must thank you for not proliferating completely specious arguments, though I wish those who are pro-life would come to realize that not all people believe in the western God. As a pro-choice woman, I must comment again and thank you for the accurate and real images you have of aborted fetuses: I worked in a clinic. I have seen every aspect of the process. I have had an abortion myself, and don't regret it. And I feel that more and more pro-choice women should have to reckon with the realism of what they are doing. I will be forwarding this to all of the women that I know, so that we all can see this aspect of the choices that we make. It is real. And we must be willing to take responsibility.</p>

After seeing these images, I know now, my stand. I am pro-life, not pro-abortion. I will refuse to even mention it as "pro-choice" any longer, if this debate ever comes up.&nbsp; Public schools feel we are mature enough for many different topics; but showing images of abortion reality, they do
not think we can handle? Let them have shown the guy and girls what happens to unwanted to babies, what abortion really is. You want to really get people to wear protection ! They will - because this is visible, and tears at your very soul. Why is this even a " choice"? And of course it is a life; if it was not, there would be NOTHING to abort!</p>

<p>I have always been pro-life, but I have never understood why. Abort73.com has helped me to realize why I believe abortion is wrong. The website has an extensive amount of information available that was extremely helpful to me in determining why I believe what I do. I feel more prepared to defend my beliefs as a result of visiting this website.</p>

<p>[This website] has impacted me in such a way that I am going to do a project at my school to see if I can change the mind of others to believe that pro-life is a better life. I will look at things in a whole new perspective on this subject and all around life. Thank you for your time and money that you have put into this website to uncover the truth about abortion. Even though I'm only 13 I believe that I can impact other peoples live in many different ways. THANK-YOU

<p>I've seen pictures from other sites that did change my opinion from pro-choice to pro-life. I used think that if a woman was raped and ended up pregnant she should have the choice of whether or not to carry the child. I don't know why I used to think that, I was young and immature I suppose, but the content on this site solidifies my belief that abortion is murder.</p>

Honestly, I never sat down and thought about this situation and in my English class I was assigned a paper on the argument of abortion. After looking over this website I am just speechless. There are so many teens that don't know any of this stuff and it should be in their studies in high school... I cant wait to turn in my paper now. You guys did an awesome job putting this together. I hope this will change many
peoples mind.</p>

<p>I just wanted to say THANK YOU to whomever it is that wrote <a href="../HTML/I-J-1-bible.html">The Bible and Unborn Life</a>.
I have been battling for two weeks about getting an abortion. I prayed to God for an answer, and found this website tonight.&nbsp; You have helped me understand God's view on unborn babies, and I have decided against an abortion. Thank you again for your words, they are truly helpful and uplifting. Although I have a very narrow path ahead of me, I am inspired to know that there are people out there who still have morals and believe the same as me. I found your website very informative, and wanted you to know how truly instrumental you all are for making this website. Thanks again.</p>

<p>I don't know if I agree with you completely but after seeing that disturbing video I am more on your side then before. I am 17 years old and I have a son that is 14 months old and I would never ever get an abortion. I think that it is wrong, but I think that
if a woman is raped she should be able to get an abortion because it wasn't her fault, but if you make a mistake and weren't careful then you should deal with it and keep the baby. I am happy that you guys provide such good information that the girls that get abortions all the time should really see and know about.</p>

I have had two or three friends that have had an abortion... I always thought that was for them and that might be the best thing for them at their age. Today, I see a whole different side of the problem and I know that if I bring a child in this world that I am going to think about this video before I ever have an abortion. I think you should send this around to all the schools and let every kid watch it.......maybe they well think about it first.</p>

<p>I've always been pro-choice...why would a 12 year old girl who's been raped be forced to keep a child that she will despise for the rest of her life? I sympathized with people who had abortions because I felt it was necessary in some cases. Your website and your video has completely changed my mind.My mother was forced to abort a child before my sister and I (by my father), and I can now understand why she has so much anger and why she's so messed up... I've made some bad choices in life and slept around, out of spite for my parents, knowing that if I were ever to get pregnant I would abort... Until today, I still believed that if I were to get pregnant I could just abort and my parents would never know. But I don't think I could ever live with the pain of knowing I had given up my fiance's child. I love him so much and I don't care what my parents will think. What if I can't be blessed by God again "when I'm ready"? My mother's abortion messed up our family. I am not willing to do the same for mine. Thank you for letting me understand.</p>

Although I am most probably never going to become an extreme pro-lifer, now I am convinced that abortion should be illegal in most cases, with few EXCEPTIONS.</p>

<p>This is one of the best pro-life websites I have seen. The videos do what everyone is afraid to do, show EXACTLY what is happening. In order to argue the case properly, things like this HAVE to be done. Show the pro-choice people what they are doing through their 'choice'. The cases were argued very well and really opened a few of my friends eyes who I had not already opened before (the video in particular). Thank you sooooo much for helping my friends see the light, 3 of them are strong pro-lifers now. Thanks again.</p>

<p>I have an unplanned pregnancy &amp; my partner had put lot of pressure on me to have an abortion. I have never really had an opinion on abortion but always knew in my heart that if the situation arose, I couldn't do it. I went along to [the abortion clinic] anyway just so I could say that I had looked at it from all angles &amp; that he couldn't say I didn't look at it from his point of view. When I walked through the door I knew instantly that no way was I going to abort this little baby. I still went through with the whole discussion &amp; they made it out to be a simple procedure. I came home &amp; looked up abortion on the internet &amp; saw all the horrific pictures &amp; I honestly couldn't believe it. Surely these abortion clinics should be brutally honest &amp; show these pictures rather than make out that all you're having is similar to a bikini wax!!!! I cried so much when I saw the pictures &amp; was even more shocked at the partial birth abortions...I didn't know they existed (call me naive but I didn't!!!)... I am so relieved that I have made the right decision to keep my baby &amp; that I stood up to the pressure of people.&nbsp;I have printed pictures off the website to show my partner so he can look at it realistically and not just shove it to the back of his mind. I am 11 weeks and when I saw those little fingers and feet etc in the video the tears rolled down in sorrow at the loss of those poor beautiful innocents. The final scene was horrific &amp; I looked at that baby &amp; thought how could someone do that?? I will never know how the human race works.</p>

<p>I was a lost and confused 15 year old... I thought I was pregnant and considered my options. Abortion seemed a fair enough option as no one would ever know (especially my parents). I saw my friend wearing a shirt that said "Abort73". I didn't ask her about it, but I was curious what it was about. Later when I got home I visited the site - after 5 minutes my jaw dropped and I realized just how horrible abortion was. Thank you abort73! I am convinced.</p>
