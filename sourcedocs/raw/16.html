Her doctor told her that he was “incompatible with life.” Christensen and her husband wanted a child desperately—they called him Spartacus, because of how hard he seemed to be fighting—but she decided, immediately, to terminate the pregnancy: if the child was born, he would suffer, and would not live long; she wanted to minimize his suffering to whatever extent she could.</p><p>Christensen lived in New York, a state where, since 2014, an estimated <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/vital_statistics/2014/#abor" target="_blank">twenty-five to twenty-seven per cent of pregnancies end in abortion</a>. Abortion was legalized in New York in 1970, three years before the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade. Abortion was a crime in most other states; in New York, it became a crime with major exceptions. It is still regulated in the criminal code, and, Christensen learned, it is a crime in New York if an abortion is performed after a woman is twenty-four weeks pregnant, unless the mother’s life is in immediate jeopardy. Even though the baby in her womb would not be able to live outside of it, she would have to go elsewhere to have an abortion.</p><p>Politicians had been attempting for nearly a decade to pass a law called the Reproductive Health Act, which would remove abortion from New York’s criminal code and codify the protections of Roe v. Wade, which affirms a woman’s right to an abortion, with limits, in state law. The R.H.A. had been approved multiple times by the Democrat-controlled state assembly, but it had never passed the state senate, which was controlled by Republicans.</p><p>Christensen and her medical team made arrangements for her to travel to Colorado, where abortion is essentially regulated <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/state-facts-about-abortion-colorado" target="_blank">like any other medical procedure</a>. With help from her mother, she scrounged up more than ten thousand dollars to pay for the procedure and the trip. In Boulder, a doctor named Warren Hern administered an injection that stopped her baby’s heart but prevented her from bleeding and going into labor. Afterward, while waiting for her flight, she could not help feeling as if what she’d done was shameful and illegal. She flew back to New York and had a physically excruciating stillbirth at a hospital.</p><p>A week and a half later, she e-mailed me. I was working at the Web site Jezebel, which often publishes stories about abortion law. Christensen wanted to describe what had happened to her. When we spoke on the phone, her milk was still coming in. Her baseline experience of pregnancy had been punishing to begin with, and New York law had made it much worse.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>When New York first legalized abortion, in 1970, it was one of only four states where the practice was legal. Of the four, New York’s law was the most liberal, as it had no residency requirement. Between July of 1970 and January of 1973, roughly three hundred and fifty thousand out-of-state abortion patients came to New York; in the first two years after the state law passed, sixty per cent of women who had abortions in New York came from out of state. “New York used to be an oasis,” Katie Watson told me recently. Watson is a professor and bioethicist at Northwestern, a former lawyer for the A.C.L.U. of Illinois, and the author of “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/books/review-scarlet-a-abortion-katie-watson.html" target="_blank">Scarlet A: The Ethics, Law, and Politics of Ordinary Abortion</a>.” “It changed things nationally,” she said, of New York State. “And then it just never updated its statute.”</p><p>The vast majority of abortions take place in the first trimester. Fewer than ten per cent of abortions occur at fourteen weeks or later, and, according to the Guttmacher Institute, only <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/later-abortion" target="_blank">slightly more than one per cent of abortions</a> are performed at twenty-one weeks or later. Given how rare late-term abortion is, few elected officials are willing to risk the political costs of making it a cause. Late-term abortion makes many people deeply uncomfortable: at that point in a pregnancy, we are no longer talking about a lime-size fetus that hardly resembles a person.</p><p>Doctors who perform late-term abortions have wrestled with the profound difficulties of fetal personhood; they have arguably done so to a greater extent than anyone else. Several years ago, I interviewed Dr. Susan Robinson, a now-retired late-term-abortion provider in New Mexico who appeared in the documentary “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf3rETOO62s" target="_blank">After Tiller</a>,” about the only four doctors in the U.S. who, at the time the film was made, openly performed late-term abortions. (Dr. George Tiller, who previously had been part of that group, was murdered by an anti-abortion activist, in 2009.) Robinson told me that, in her practice, she used whatever terms her patients used. “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.thehairpin.com/2013/09/interview-with-dr/" target="_blank">If she refers to it as her baby, I’ll refer to it as her baby</a>,” she said. “If she’s named the baby, I’ll use the baby’s name, too.” She would ask patients, particularly those who were there because of fetal anomalies, if they wanted to hold their baby, and if they wanted footprints. She would cry with them and pray with them. “I mean, imagine being six months pregnant and finding out your baby’s missing half its brain, and you’ve got this nursery you’ve painted at home, you’re so ready—I don’t want them to go home from the procedure with absolutely nothing to remember and honor the baby<span data-page="page_2"></span> and its birth,” Robinson said.</p><p>I was in my mid-twenties when I saw “After Tiller,” and it was the first time I’d really thought about late-term abortion. I was struck by Robinson’s aura of sorrowful compassion. She spent every day with an ethical question that many people abhor. I asked her how she drew her own lines—if she ever refused to perform an abortion when a woman’s fetus was healthy. The calculus was hard, she said. Sometimes the compelling factor was that the patient was eleven years old. But what if the patient were fifteen, or sixteen? “What is the ethical difference between doing an abortion at twenty-nine and thirty-two weeks?” she said she would ask herself, weighing each situation. She’d had a patient from France, she told me, who came to her at thirty-five weeks, and she had turned that woman down. “It wouldn’t be safe,” she said.</p><p>Since that interview, I’ve come to think that understanding late-term abortion is a key to understanding abortion and reproduction generally. For people who believe that abortion is a medical procedure that a woman chooses to have, or not to have, in consultation with her doctor, why would we restrict abortion in our legal codes at all? The decision to restrict abortion in the legal code is based on the idea that there are people who want to kill babies, and the law exists to prevent killing. The conviction that we should instead regulate abortion medically is rooted in the proposition that late-term abortions happen not because women and doctors want to kill babies but because circumstances conspire to make late-term abortions necessary, and that the women who are in these situations, and their doctors, are the people best suited to decide when those circumstances have arrived.</p><p>Katrina Kimport, a research sociologist and associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California–San Francisco, has, over the past couple of years, been conducting <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2013/11/who-seeks-abortions-or-after-20-weeks" target="_blank">the most comprehensive research on late-term abortion to date</a>. People have certain assumptions about late-term abortion, she told me. They imagine a woman spontaneously getting cold feet in her third trimester, or an indecisive dawdler who decides, on a whim, at twenty-seven weeks, that she’s simply done. “But, in reality,” Kimport told me, “these are people who were planning to continue the pregnancy and obtained a piece of vital information that made that change. Or they’re people who just did not know that they were pregnant—people with other existing physical conditions, or people without typical symptoms—who then knew they didn’t want to continue it, and then a series of obstacles pushed them over the line.”</p><p>For Kimport and other advocates for abortion access, a woman’s ability to decide if and when she becomes a mother is dependent not just on abortion rights but on a continuum of reproductive health access. Restrictions on contraception—high co-pays, insurance hoops, a lack of local clinics that provide birth control—produce more unwanted pregnancies, and thus increase <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/10/contraceptive-use-key-reducing-abortion-worldwide" target="_blank">the number of abortions</a>. Restrictions on abortion providers, including mandatory waiting periods, so-called “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/01/science/abortion-supreme-court-trump.html" target="_blank"><em class="small">TRAP</em> laws</a>,” and fetal-pain laws, are intended to cause women to give up on getting abortions, but, in many cases, they simply insure that <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/delays-in-accessing-care-among-us-abortion-patients" target="_blank">abortions will be performed later</a> than women want them to be performed.</p><p>In the study that Kimport conducted with Diana Greene Foster, her colleague at U.C.S.F., women who sought late-term abortions were twelve weeks pregnant, on average, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2013/11/who-seeks-abortions-or-after-20-weeks" target="_blank">when they discovered the pregnancy</a>; women who sought first-trimester abortions were five weeks along, on average. Odile Schalit, the director at the Brigid Alliance, a new nonprofit that helps women travel to and from New York in order to obtain abortions, told me that the majority of the women the Brigid Alliance had served so far were New Yorkers who needed to leave the state for late-term abortions. “We expect people to know immediately when they’re pregnant, and to know exactly how to handle it,” Schalit said. “We don’t take into account the possibility of ambivalence, that they’re minors, or that they have to figure out how to take off work and get childcare, or that they might be in a coercive, unsupportive, or abusive relationship, or that they might not have the financial or logistical or bodily autonomy to access real choice at all.”</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>After speaking with Christensen in 2016, I transcribed and edited our conversation and posted it on Jezebel. To my surprise, and to Christensen’s, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://jezebel.com/interview-with-a-woman-who-recently-had-an-abortion-at-1781972395" target="_blank">more than a million people read the piece within the week</a>. Dozens of women wrote to me, telling me about their own late-term abortions; I forwarded their e-mails to Christensen, who had used a pseudonym for the interview. A social worker at Mount Sinai, the hospital where she’d delivered, also passed along e-mails for her from women who’d needed to terminate a pregnancy in the third trimester.</p><p>Recently, I asked Christensen about her decision to speak with me, and about everything that’s happened to her since. “I called the clinic before I talked to you,” she said, “and I asked if there was anything they’d like me not to say. And then Dr. Hern grabbed the phone, and he told me, with all this urgency, ‘Erika, you don’t need to ask permission from anyone. It’s your story.’ ” In the subsequent correspondence with the women who e-mailed her—she called them her “sad pen pals”—she repeated his counsel: they didn’t need<span data-page="page_3"></span> to rationalize their decisions to her or to anyone. She started to consider becoming a pro-choice activist, under her real name. “Any fear I had about being attacked, being called a murderer, was trumped by not wanting people to think I was ashamed.”</p><p>A few months after the piece was published, Katharine Bodde, a senior policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union, asked me if she could contact the woman in the interview. She got in touch with Christensen and told her about the Reproductive Health Act. In January, 2017, Christensen did her first public event in support of the R.H.A. A few weeks later, she and her husband, Garin Marschall, went to Albany to talk to legislators. She had recently  found out that she was pregnant again. “They put a face on the issue,” Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the N.Y.C.L.U., told me. “It changes the game when lawmakers are speaking to people who have been impacted by the law.”</p><p>Christensen and Marschall had moved to Baltimore, but they trekked to Albany eight times during New York’s 2017–18 legislative session to lobby for the bill, sometimes telling their story a dozen times in a day. In April, 2017, Christensen gave birth to a cherubic baby girl named Pepper. One month later, Marschall built the Web site <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.rhavote.com/" target="_blank">RHAVote.com</a>. In early 2018, the family went on a tour of upstate cities to talk to people at events for congressional and state senate candidates. In the midterms, the Democrats picked up eight state senate seats, unseated five incumbents, and won a 40–23 majority in the chamber. Most of the newly elected Democrats had done an event in support of the R.H.A.</p><p>Soon after the midterms, Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a statement about the legislative priorities for his third term. With <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/brett-kavanaugh-donald-trump-and-the-things-men-do-for-other-men">the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh</a> to the Supreme Court, the “federal assault on women’s reproductive rights” had extended to a “Supreme Court that threatens to roll back Roe v. Wade,” the statement read. Cuomo insisted that both the R.H.A. and the <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/issues/comprehensive-contraception-care-act" target="_blank">Comprehensive Contraception Coverage Act</a> should be passed during the first thirty days of the new term.</p><p>The R.H.A. was originally written to garner bipartisan support, so that it could pass a conservative-controlled senate. It legalized late-term abortions, like Christensen’s, that involve the viability of a fetus. But, with a strong Democratic majority, there was a new question to consider. Did the political will exist to go further than Roe, and to affirm a woman’s right to an abortion with no legal restrictions?</p><p>“I’m not sure that people—and specifically I mean pro-choice people who believe in limits, which is a lot of people—understand the full complexity of the issue,” Christensen told me. The facts of her own case, she said, lent themselves to sympathy, even among religious conservatives: she was a middle-class white woman who wanted to be a mother. But she didn’t see her abortion as a tragedy. She felt lucky that she was able to get it. “And the same goes for cases that the R.H.A. doesn’t cover, cases that don’t seem as sympathetic—the woman from a rural area who didn’t find out she was pregnant until seventeen weeks, who has three kids already and no travel support. Do we leave those women out? And, if we do leave them out, do we at least understand what we’re doing?” Christensen said that, because of her year of intense hormonal fluctuations, she hadn’t known that she was pregnant with Pepper until she was sixteen weeks along.</p><p>“The R.H.A. is a huge, enormously significant, long-awaited correction,” she said. “If it passes exactly as is, it would be a huge step in the right direction. But, in a room full of people who trust women, I don’t know why we would only trust them in specific circumstances. And I’m afraid that, if the R.H.A. passes, no one will be ready to talk about abortion in New York again until we’re dead. But we’re certainly going to try.”</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>A law that governs abortion by examining a woman’s reasons for having one carries an implicit suggestion that there are objectively correct choices in pregnancy, choices that can be ascertained and judged by the body politic. But a woman who receives dire news about her fetus might do any number of things. She might choose to enter perinatal hospice, for instance, a model of care for parents who continue pregnancies when the baby’s life is expected to be brief. A woman whose pregnancy puts her in serious and immediate danger—from her own body, from her partner—might choose to continue her pregnancy and risk her own life. “What if your doctor says that the baby will live ten days?” Kimport told me. “What if there’s a five-per-cent chance that it will live to five years? How do you make sense of that? How do you codify this decision-making in a law that is supposed to apply to everyone?”</p><p>“It becomes very complicated when you say that the law decides whether a reason for abortion is valid or invalid,” Kimport went on. “But when you let patients decide about abortion it’s much, much simpler in the end.”</p><p>Soon after the midterms in November, R.H.A. advocates—representatives from the National Institute for Reproductive Health, the N.Y.C.L.U., and other organizations—met with the bill’s sponsors, the state assemblywoman Deborah Glick and the state senator Liz Krueger. The R.H.A.<span data-page="page_final"></span> was nearly certain to pass, and yet the situation was delicate. The Democratic majority had made new possibilities visible: Oregon, for example, affirms <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/state-law/oregon/" target="_blank">abortion as a constitutional right</a> and has no legislative restrictions on the procedure whatsoever. But to introduce either of those options might threaten the Democratic majority that made them possible in the first place. The R.H.A. still has <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.syracuse.com/opinion/2019/01/dont-expand-abortion-in-new-york-commentary.html" target="_blank">vocal opponents</a>. The Catholic Bishops of New York State <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.whec.com/news/catholic-bishops-denounce-reproductive-health-act/5213978/" target="_blank">recently denounced it</a>; anti-abortion advocates have argued that the R.H.A. removes the state’s ability to hold <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.timesunion.com/opinion/article/Viewpoint-RHA-mdash-dangerous-dehumanizing-13536945.php" target="_blank">domestic abusers of pregnant women</a> fully accountable, and that the maternal-health exception effectively permits late-term abortion “on demand” already. Republican opposition to the bill <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Senate-Republicans-struggle-to-define-opposition-13063686.php" target="_blank">had been subdued over the past year</a> but was almost certain to flare to life if it were significantly changed.</p><p>In the end, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/s2796" target="_blank">the bill’s language was expanded</a>—a memo at the top of the bill recognizes “a woman’s fundamental right to access safe, legal abortion”—but its substance remained largely the same. On January 17th, Glick and Krueger <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nystateofpolitics.com/2019/01/glick-krueger-reintroduce-rha/" target="_blank">reintroduced the bill</a>. “After years of fighting for the passage of this essential protection for women, our moment has finally arrived,” Glick said. Senate Democrats voiced their intention of passing it by January 22nd, the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. At a recent event at Barnard College, Cuomo, standing onstage with Hillary Clinton, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/nyregion/abortion-roe-wade-new-york.html" target="_blank">reaffirmed</a> his commitment to the R.H.A, and pledged that he would not pass a budget until the R.H.A. and C.C.A. were both passed.“The Republican Senate said, ‘You don’t need a state law codifying Roe v. Wade,’ ” he said. “ ‘No administration would ever roll back Roe v. Wade.’ ” Cuomo called on the legislature to pass a constitutional amendment—which must pass in two separate legislative sessions and then be approved by voters—to affirm reproductive rights in the state constitution. This will likely be the next big push for advocates of the R.H.A.</p><p>“We have to understand abortion as an equal-rights issue,” Watson, the Northwestern professor, told me. “Only women can have the consequences of an unwanted pregnancy after sex.” She was interested, she said, in “moving from the politics of sympathy to the politics of respect. The politics of sympathy holds that a woman gets to have an abortion because it’s justified. The politics of respect would say that the pregnant woman determines the moral status of her fetus or embryo, and weighs that assessment against her own reasoning.” Really, she added, her preference was to take the law out of the picture. “Why is later abortion not just a matter of what doctors would or wouldn’t do?”</p><p>While I was writing this piece, Christensen sent me an e-mail. She included a video of Pepper, who is nineteen months old now, in rainbow socks, playing with her mother’s dogs. “As other states grow more and more restrictive, we’re going to have more and more people coming to New York,” she wrote. “Do we want them to scramble over the state line and feel like they’re begging for help? Or do we want them to see that there’s no shame here, that they’re supported in their decisions?” After her abortion, she said, and in everything that followed, she had realized that she was good at talking to people about difficult things. “And we need to have those harder conversations,” she added. “We need to ask people to work through and maybe live with their discomfort with this issue. We need people to understand that they may have to exchange some of their comfort in order to afford women real dignity, real trust.”</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk"><div class="ArticleContributors__contributorWrapper___1CrIJ"><div class="Avatar__avatar___1_uRc ArticleContributors__bioAvatar___11Nu0"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/contributors/jia-tolentino"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b79ebe912338a37865e/1:1/w_130,c_limit/tolentino-jia-1.png, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b79ebe912338a37865e/1:1/w_260,c_limit/tolentino-jia-1.png 2x"/><img alt="" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b79ebe912338a37865e/1:1/w_130,c_limit/tolentino-jia-1.png" title=""/></picture></div></a></div><ul class="ArticleContributors__contributorBios___3_jrJ false"><li><p class="ArticleContributors__contributorBioText___3m1QB">Jia Tolentino is a staff writer at The New Yorker.

spring of 2016, Erika Christensen was thirty-one weeks pregnant, and found out that the baby she was carrying would be unable to survive outside the womb. Her doctor told her that he was “incompatible with life.” Christensen and her husband wanted a child desperately—they called him Spartacus, because of how hard he seemed to be fighting—but she decided, immediately, to terminate the pregnancy: if the child was born, he would suffer, and would not live long; she wanted to minimize his suffering to whatever extent she could."],["p","Christensen lived in New York, a state where, since 2014, an estimated ",["a",{"href":"https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/vital_statistics/2014/#abor"},"twenty-five to twenty-seven per cent of pregnancies end in abortion"],". Abortion was legalized in New York in 1970, three years before the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade. Abortion was a crime in most other states; in New York, it became a crime with major exceptions. It is still regulated in the criminal code, and, Christensen learned, it is a crime in New York if an abortion is performed after a woman is twenty-four weeks pregnant, unless the mother’s life is in immediate jeopardy. Even though the baby in her womb would not be able to live outside of it, she would have to go elsewhere to have an abortion."],["p","Politicians had been attempting for nearly a decade to pass a law called the Reproductive Health Act, which would remove abortion from New York’s criminal code and codify the protections of Roe v. Wade, which affirms a woman’s right to an abortion, with limits, in state law. The R.H.A. had been approved multiple times by the Democrat-controlled state assembly, but it had never passed the state senate, which was controlled by Republicans."],["p","Christensen and her medical team made arrangements for her to travel to Colorado, where abortion is essentially regulated ",["a",{"href":"https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/state-facts-about-abortion-colorado"},"like any other medical procedure"],". With help from her mother, she scrounged up more than ten thousand dollars to pay for the procedure and the trip. In Boulder, a doctor named Warren Hern administered an injection that stopped her baby’s heart but prevented her from bleeding and going into labor. Afterward, while waiting for her flight, she could not help feeling as if what she’d done was shameful and illegal. She flew back to New York and had a physically excruciating stillbirth at a hospital."],["p","A week and a half later, she e-mailed me. I was working at the Web site Jezebel, which often publishes stories about abortion law. Christensen wanted to describe what had happened to her. When we spoke on the phone, her milk was still coming in.

New York first legalized abortion, in 1970, it was one of only four states where the practice was legal. Of the four, New York’s law was the most liberal, as it had no residency requirement. Between July of 1970 and January of 1973, roughly three hundred and fifty thousand out-of-state abortion patients came to New York; in the first two years after the state law passed, sixty per cent of women who had abortions in New York came from out of state. “New York used to be an oasis,” Katie Watson told me recently. Watson is a professor and bioethicist at Northwestern, a former lawyer for the A.C.L.U. of Illinois, and the author of “",["a",{"href":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/books/review-scarlet-a-abortion-katie-watson.html"},"Scarlet A: The Ethics, Law, and Politics of Ordinary Abortion"],".” “It changed things nationally,” she said, of New York State. “And then it just never updated its statute.”"],["p","The vast majority of abortions take place in the first trimester. Fewer than ten per cent of abortions occur at fourteen weeks or later, and, according to the Guttmacher Institute, only ",["a",{"href":"https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/later-abortion"},"slightly more than one per cent of abortions"]," are performed at twenty-one weeks or later. Given how rare late-term abortion is, few elected officials are willing to risk the political costs of making it a cause. Late-term abortion makes many people deeply uncomfortable: at that point in a pregnancy, we are no longer talking about a lime-size fetus that hardly resembles a person."],["p","Doctors who perform late-term abortions have wrestled with the profound difficulties of fetal personhood; they have arguably done so to a greater extent than anyone else. Several years ago, I interviewed Dr. Susan Robinson, a now-retired late-term-abortion provider in New Mexico who appeared in the documentary “",["a",{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf3rETOO62s"},"After Tiller"],",” about the only four doctors in the U.S. who, at the time the film was made, openly performed late-term abortions. (Dr. George Tiller, who previously had been part of that group, was murdered by an anti-abortion activist, in 2009.) Robinson told me that, in her practice, she used whatever terms her patients used. “",["a",{"href":"https://www.thehairpin.com/2013/09/interview-with-dr/"},"If she refers to it as her baby, I’ll refer to it as her baby"],",” she said. “If she’s named the baby, I’ll use the baby’s name, too.” She would ask patients, particularly those who were there because of fetal anomalies, if they wanted to hold their baby, and if they wanted footprints. She would cry with them and pray with them. “I mean, imagine being six months pregnant and finding out your baby’s missing half its brain, and you’ve got this nursery you’ve painted at home, you’re so ready—I don’t want them to go home from the procedure with absolutely nothing to remember and honor the baby",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%222%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," and its birth,” Robinson said."],["p","I was in my mid-twenties when I saw “After Tiller,” and it was the first time I’d really thought about late-term abortion. I was struck by Robinson’s aura of sorrowful compassion. She spent every day with an ethical question that many people abhor. I asked her how she drew her own lines—if she ever refused to perform an abortion when a woman’s fetus was healthy. The calculus was hard, she said. Sometimes the compelling factor was that the patient was eleven years old. But what if the patient were fifteen, or sixteen? “What is the ethical difference between doing an abortion at twenty-nine and thirty-two weeks?” she said she would ask herself, weighing each situation. She’d had a patient from France, she told me, who came to her at thirty-five weeks, and she had turned that woman down. “It wouldn’t be safe,” she said."],["p","Since that interview, I’ve come to think that understanding late-term abortion is a key to understanding abortion and reproduction generally. For people who believe that abortion is a medical procedure that a woman chooses to have, or not to have, in consultation with her doctor, why would we restrict abortion in our legal codes at all? The decision to restrict abortion in the legal code is based on the idea that there are people who want to kill babies, and the law exists to prevent killing. The conviction that we should instead regulate abortion medically is rooted in the proposition that late-term abortions happen not because women and doctors want to kill babies but because circumstances conspire to make late-term abortions necessary, and that the women who are in these situations, and their doctors, are the people best suited to decide when those circumstances have arrived."],["p","Katrina Kimport, a research sociologist and associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California–San Francisco, has, over the past couple of years, been conducting ",["a",{"href":"https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2013/11/who-seeks-abortions-or-after-20-weeks"},"the most comprehensive research on late-term abortion to date"],". People have certain assumptions about late-term abortion, she told me. They imagine a woman spontaneously getting cold feet in her third trimester, or an indecisive dawdler who decides, on a whim, at twenty-seven weeks, that she’s simply done. “But, in reality,” Kimport told me, “these are people who were planning to continue the pregnancy and obtained a piece of vital information that made that change. Or they’re people who just did not know that they were pregnant—people with other existing physical conditions, or people without typical symptoms—who then knew they didn’t want to continue it, and then a series of obstacles pushed them over the line.”"],["p","For Kimport and other advocates for abortion access, a woman’s ability to decide if and when she becomes a mother is dependent not just on abortion rights but on a continuum of reproductive health access.

Odile Schalit, the director at the Brigid Alliance, a new nonprofit that helps women travel to and from New York in order to obtain abortions, told me that the majority of the women the Brigid Alliance had served so far were New Yorkers who needed to leave the state for late-term abortions. “We expect people to know immediately when they’re pregnant, and to know exactly how to handle it,” Schalit said. “We don’t take into account the possibility of ambivalence, that they’re minors, or that they have to figure out how to take off work and get childcare, or that they might be in a coercive, unsupportive, or abusive relationship, or that they might not have the financial or logistical or bodily autonomy to access real choice at

A few weeks later, she and her husband, Garin Marschall, went to Albany to talk to legislators.

Did the political will exist to go further than Roe, and to affirm a woman’s right to an abortion with no legal restrictions?"],["p","“I’m not sure that people—and specifically I mean pro-choice people who believe in limits, which is a lot of people—understand the full complexity of the issue,” Christensen told me. The facts of her own case, she said, lent themselves to sympathy, even among religious conservatives: she was a middle-class white woman who wanted to be a mother. But she didn’t see her abortion as a tragedy. She felt lucky that she was able to get it. “And the same goes for cases that the R.H.A. doesn’t cover, cases that don’t seem as sympathetic—the woman from a rural area who didn’t find out she was pregnant until seventeen weeks, who has three kids already and no travel support.

law that governs abortion by examining a woman’s reasons for having one carries an implicit suggestion that there are objectively correct choices in pregnancy, choices that can be ascertained and judged by the body politic. But a woman who receives dire news about her fetus might do any number of things. She might choose to enter perinatal hospice, for instance, a model of care for parents who continue pregnancies when the baby’s life is expected to be brief. A woman whose pregnancy puts her in serious and immediate danger—from her own body, from her partner—might choose to continue her pregnancy and risk her own life. “What if your doctor says that the baby will live ten days?” Kimport told me. “What if there’s a five-per-cent chance that it will live to five years?

The politics of sympathy holds that a woman gets to have an abortion because it’s justified. The politics of respect would say that the pregnant woman determines the moral status of her fetus or embryo, and weighs that assessment against her own reasoning.” Really, she added, her preference was to take the law out of the picture. “Why is later abortion not just a matter of what doctors would or wouldn’t do?”"],["p","While I was writing this piece, Christensen sent me an e-mail. She included a video of Pepper, who is nineteen months old now, in rainbow socks, playing with her mother’s dogs. “As other states grow more and more restrictive, we’re going to have more and more people coming to New York,” she wrote. “Do we want them to scramble over the state line and feel like they’re begging for help? Or do we want them to see that there’s no shame here, that they’re supported in their decisions?” After her abortion, she said, and in everything that followed, she had realized that she was good at talking to people about difficult things. “And we need to have those harder conversations,” she added. “We need to ask people to work through and maybe live with their discomfort with this issue. We need people to understand that they may have to exchange some of their comfort in order to afford women real dignity, real

I’d called people in her home town and at the local high schools, public and private. I’d consulted the yearbooks of the colleges she’d supposedly attended, and their alumni offices. I’d canvassed aging former volunteers for the Presidential campaign of Senator [Eugene McCarthy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/08/lessons-from-the-election-of-1968), for whom she was volunteering that night, fifty-one years ago, when she challenged Robert F. Kennedy in a sleepy airport diner in Indianapolis.\n\nFrom their two-hour conversation, an eighteen-year-old undergraduate named Pat Sylvester came to embody, for [Bobby Kennedy](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/robert-kennedy-without-tears), a whole generation of idealistic young Americans, the ones who, he hoped, would help make him President. And, ever since, people have tried tracking her down. But, as my own quest to find her fizzled, I came to doubt that she’d ever actually existed. Then, suddenly, not long ago, she materialized.\n\nIt began in the wee hours of May 8, 1968\\. Kennedy, then a junior senator from New York, had just survived a crucial challenge to his fledging, fragile candidacy, beating back a determined McCarthy, along with Indiana’s governor, who was a stand-in for Vice-President Hubert Humphrey, in the Indiana Presidential primary. Now he could go on to fight in Oregon and California.\n\nBut, amid all the excitement that evening, Kennedy had forgotten to eat, and finding food at that hour wasn’t easy. “The only place in Indianapolis where you can get even a glass of water after 1 a.m. is the airport,” the New York *Post* writer Jimmy Breslin, who was there covering the campaign, groused. So out to the airport they all went: the candidate, a few aides, and some intrepid reporters who’d learned in Dallas never to leave a Kennedy unattended.\n\nThat’s where they found Sylvester, a student at the University of Massachusetts, Breslin later wrote. With her was a second McCarthy volunteer, whom she’d met just minutes earlier, a twenty-one-year-old senior at the University of North Carolina named Taylor Branch. Years later, he’d win a Pulitzer Prize for the first of three books he wrote on Dr. [Martin Luther King, Jr](https://www.newyorker.com/books/double-take/martin-luther-king-jr-in-the-new-yorker).\n\nSylvester was wearing a straw hat with a McCarthy ribbon wrapped around it, and Branch sported two McCarthy pins on his tan jacket. They’d missed their respective flights out that night, to Providence by way of Pittsburgh for her, to Atlanta for him. Both sat, exhausted and dejected, by their suitcases.\n\nKennedy had won the primary that night, but something still gnawed at him: he considered McCarthy’s volunteers superior to his own. Just the night before, at a local restaurant called Sam’s Attic, when someone had told Kennedy that McCarthy’s kids were “brighter, more radical, more committed” than his, Kennedy had shaken “his drooping head affirmatively,” according to Jack Newfield, of the *Village Voice*. “I wish I had some of them,” Kennedy lamented.\n\nMary McGrory, of the Washington *Star*, who had studied the Kennedys for twenty years, spotted that same envy. “He does not need them, but he wants them,” she wrote. “They would bring luster and spontaneity to what is a dazzling but mechanical effort.” But those very kids hated him, Kennedy knew. They considered him a coward for equivocating on Vietnam and an opportunist both for bigfooting their candidate and for jumping into the race belatedly.\n\n\n+++inset-right\n[#image: /photos/5cf98b088d7925ec02f0e1ca]||||||\n+++\n\n\nNow, making his way through the empty terminal, Kennedy spotted Sylvester and Branch, walked over to them, smiling, and invited them to join him for a bite to eat. “All right,” Sylvester replied, before trying to place her McCarthy hat on Kennedy’s head. They seated themselves in a booth across from Kennedy, while a knot of reporters hovered nearby. Kennedy was smaller than Branch had imagined, but something else about him made a bigger impression: his intense blue eyes.\n\nThen, for the next couple of hours, Kennedy probed and proselytized, trying to understand why the two preferred McCarthy to him and seeing if he could change their minds. Breslin got at least some of it down and, alone among the reporters, wrote it up. The others were, as reporters like to say, just “gathering string.”\n\nThough Bobby Kennedy was one of the most famous men in the world, Sylvester wasn’t cowed. Instead, she let him have it, criticizing his inconsistent stance on Vietnam, lambasting his ineffectual campaign workers, and complaining about the unfair advantage Kennedy enjoyed simply by dint of his famous name. When Kennedy asked the two what they now planned to do following their candidate’s setback in this most recent primary, she didn’t mince words. “We’re going to stay,” she answered. “Most of them will. The ones who like McCarthy don’t want you.”\n\nThe more Kennedy pressed, depicting McCarthy as a racially insensitive dilettante who didn’t really want to be President, a man who was taking advantage of his volunteers, the more Sylvester and Branch dug in. And the deeper they dug in, the more Kennedy admired, and coveted, them. “I remember him complaining that McCarthy got the A students and he got the gentlemen’s-C frat boys,” Branch told me. Meanwhile, according to Breslin, two female Kennedy campaign workers sitting at the table squirmed. “What I wouldn’t give for that girl,” one told the other.\n\n“He had won in Indiana, but he couldn’t win over those kids, and they really got to him,” a key Kennedy aide, Fred Dutton, later recalled. “For days afterward, he talked about that boy and girl in the airport coffee shop—how great they were, in their idealism and determination.” Kennedy never forgot the pair; it’s pretty fair to say, though, that that understates the impact they’d had on him, for he was to live only four more weeks.\n\nFor Branch, too, Sylvester was a revelation. The undergraduate school in Chapel Hill was still nearly all male; there, and in his native Atlanta, he’d met few young women like her, so audacious and politically engaged. “We communed,” he recalled. He told her so, and it stuck with her. “He said that he was surprised to be able to communicate so well with a girl,” Sylvester wrote to a friend, shortly afterward.\n\nBreslin’s account ends on a happy note, with Branch and Sylvester leaving the airport with Kennedy after he offered to get hotel rooms for them. To Breslin’s eye, Kennedy’s wooing was working; it marked his second triumph of the evening. “It was, last night in Indianapolis, a very good night for Robert Kennedy,” he wrote.\n\nIn fact, the two had spurned Kennedy’s offer—“we said we’d be fine,” she later wrote—and opted to spend what was left of the night in the deserted terminal. But, rather than trying to catch some sleep, they decided to write Kennedy a letter. Taking turns on a yellow legal pad, they worked on it until dawn, composing what Branch called “a frenzied, sleepy-eyed rehashing” of their discussion, letting him know that, while he hadn’t won them over, he’d impressed them anyway.\n\nAs day broke, they walked to a nearby motel where they thought Kennedy was staying and slipped their manifesto—“a treatise, really,” Branch said—under what they believed to be his door. “For all I know, they gave us the wrong room number, or they threw it in the trash,” Branch recalled. Then the two separated, without exchanging phone numbers. After all, Branch had other things on his mind; his draft physical was coming up, he was graduating soon, and getting married after that.\n\nAccording to Leon Fink, her boyfriend at the time and now a retired history professor from the University of Illinois, Sylvester was “bemused” by Breslin’s article, which appeared the next day. (It was only from reading it that Sylvester’s politically conservative parents, from whom she was largely estranged, learned that Pat had even been in Indiana.) And, for the next half century, Breslin’s account of that evening, and of Pat Sylvester, was all that history had.\n\nBut Branch didn’t forget her, and at one point he tried tracking her down—to learn, as he put it, how their shared experience “had settled” with her afterward. He would ask after her whenever he ran into former McCarthy volunteers or women who had gone to Pembroke, a women’s college, later swallowed up by Brown, to which he believed she’d gone. He reached out to Brown as well. No one knew anything. And, unsure whether he and Breslin even had her name right, he’d simply given up.\n\nTom Shea, a journalist with the Springfield *Republican*, also looked for her. He had learned of Sylvester in 1973, from reading a biography of Kennedy by Jack Newfield, a *Village Voice* reporter. He met Newfield sixteen years later and asked him about her. Every year on the [anniversary of R.F.K.’s assassination](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/robert-f-kennedys-funeral-train-fifty-years-later)—this Thursday is the fifty-first—Shea wrote a column about Bobby Kennedy, and he had devoted the 2011 edition to her. It marked one last attempt of his to find her—“a message in a bottle,” he said. \n\nA few years ago, determined to track her down for a biography he was writing of Kennedy, Larry Tye turned to Accurint, a search engine connected, it boasts, to more than sixty-five billion public records. No dice. I searched twice, in 2017 and last year, while researching and then publicizing a book I wrote on Kennedy and King. I, too, had grown curious about Pat Sylvester. Who was she? What brought her to Indianapolis that night? And what had become of her since? How well had her idealism served her? Or, more likely, what had been the depth of her disappointment? \n\nI contacted various Sylvesters in Milton, Massachusetts—her home town, Breslin had written. And Milton High School. And Milton Academy. And the University of Massachusetts. And Brown, which was more than ready for me. “We have received this same request a number of times in the past year, so I know the back story and we have an answer already on hand,” Brian Clark, the school’s director of news and editorial development, wrote back. And veterans of the McCarthy campaign in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Indiana, and Washington, D.C., all the way up to Sam Brown, McCarthy’s youth coördinator. And the curator of the Eugene McCarthy papers, at the University of Minnesota, who scoured the roster of campaign volunteers for me.\n\nThere was no trace of her anywhere. Nor did a [short online piece](http://time.com/5301554/rfk-pat-sylvester/) I wrote for *Time* produce her or anyone who had known her. In the Google era, it’s pretty hard for anyone to vanish, but, somehow, Pat Sylvester had managed to. One New York newsman mocked my persistence, and naïveté. “You’ve now learned what many of us knew throughout his career: Breslin made stuff up,” he said to me, in an e-mail.\n\nThen, in March of this year, a Milton Academy graduate named Reva Seybolt, now a life coach in Vermont, stumbled upon a note I’d sent her via Facebook in December, 2017\\. What she wrote me was thrilling, then crushing, then intriguing. “I just saw your message,” she said, adding, “patsy died of breast cancer a long, long time ago. If you still need info, I can get you in touch with her daughter.”\n\nAnd she did. With breathtaking speed, I was in touch with people who’d known and loved her, and reading the letters she’d written around the time of her meeting with Kennedy. Patsy—she was never Pat to her friends—had died, but now some part of her had come back to life. I wrote to Branch, saying simply that I’d cracked the story. “Is she alive?” he quickly e-mailed back. “If so, might she speak with me?”\n\nPatsy *had* attended Milton Academy, but only through the ninth grade. She’d then moved to the Westtown School, a Quaker institution in West Chester, Pennsylvania, where she became politically active and, in June, 1966, was elected co-president of the student body. A picture on the front page of the school paper, *Brown and White*, showing her with a pixie haircut and pearls, captured her free spirit, though not her uncertainties or her flaming red hair. She graduated in June, 1967, shortly after taking a bus to New York to march in the Spring Mobilization against the Vietnam war. \n\nShe had indeed been at the University of Massachusetts in 1968, just as Breslin claimed. But, even before Indianapolis, she’d shown a penchant for fateful airport encounters, the by-product of a probing, improvisational life style. It was in a second such rendezvous that she’d met Leon Fink (she’d been reading Sartre when he struck up a conversation), and it was during another chance encounter that a Harvard boy had invited her to campaign for McCarthy in Indiana.\n\nAnd, as far away as Indiana then seemed, she up and went. As her letters make clear, she was at loose ends at the time, quoting Rod McKuen *and* W. H. Auden, subsisting on cigarettes and coffee, careening between nihilism, activism, and radicalism. (Two nights before the balloting in Indiana, she’d experimented with pot and Scotch, and her stomach had gone haywire.) With his detached and cynical mien—he didn’t seem to take either himself or politics too seriously—McCarthy appealed to her; Kennedy was all gung ho in a way she found off-putting.\n\n“This is so damn exciting,” she wrote to her Westtown roommate, Margy Frysinger. “I’m a politician at heart when I became involved, and I am involved. Right to the roots of my hair. We all live, breathe, eat McCarthy.” Naturally, she said, she was “anti-Kennedy, but not anti his workers. They’re just misguided.” To her, by contrast, McCarthy’s volunteers were unbelievably dedicated, putting their grades and even their lives (the men had jeopardized their draft exemptions by dropping out to work for him)—on the line.“We are mentally prepared for defeat—but won’t accept it easily,” she wrote on the eve of the vote. “For McCarthy we pray.”\n\nKennedy may have “neutralized” Branch that night, as he later put it, impressing him in particular with his sensitivity to racial issues, but he didn’t have the same effect on Sylvester. “In the airport at 1:00 a.m., a guy and I were sitting with our McCarthy stuff in the middle of the hall,” she wrote. “We were discussing our anti-Kennedy feelings, when, lo, along comes a group of Kennedyophiles. In the second wave of them, the Senator walked toward us. He smiled, shook our hands (and put his arm on my shoulder) and invited us for breakfast.\n\n“For an hour + 45 mins we talked with him directly and openly,” she went on. “We learned a lot of stuff from him. Accordingly we told him a lot of stuff. We were open in our criticism of Kennedy’s workers—how dumb they were and how they couldn’t satisfactorily explain why they were for Kennedy over McCarthy.” To her, even the Republican governor from New York, Nelson Rockefeller, may have been preferable to Kennedy. “We now have some serious thinking to do before we decide for whom we really are,” she wrote. “And it may end up being Rockefeller. One cannot be a-political. I was not involved before, and now I am immeshed in everything that’s going on.”\n\nTo her friends, the encounter with Bobby Kennedy—and particularly her attempt to place a McCarthy hat on his head—was not just the product of an anti-authoritarian Quaker education; it was pure, vintage Patsy. “She would do outrageous things every now and then, for someone who would act pretty proper and reserved most of the time,” Frysinger, now a retired administrator in Pennsylvania, said. “She was very feisty,” Nina Brown, a landscape architect in Boston, said. “She had the ability to tell you a difficult truth about yourself and make you laugh.”\n\nDuring the despondent summer of 1968, with both [Kennedy](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/robert-f-kennedys-funeral-train-fifty-years-later) and [King](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/09/honoring-martin-luther-king-jr-fifty-years-after-his-death) now dead, Sylvester had forsworn waiting tables—“I just cannot push $300 worth of pots + pans in people’s faces when they should use the money for something else”—and worked full time for McCarthy. Branch slowly soured on McCarthy, but the candidate remained “imbedded in my bones,” Sylvester wrote. Unbeknownst to either of them, they both attended the Democratic Convention, in Chicago, that August: he was inside, as a McCarthy volunteer; she was outside, getting tear-gassed.\n\nWhen she returned to college, it was to McGill; it wasn’t only draft-age men who fled to Canada in those days. After graduating, she remained in Montreal, married briefly, raised a daughter by herself, forsook politics and subsisted (barely) on freelance writing and editing. She died in August, 1990, ten days after turning forty-one.\n\nHer daughter, now Nicole Fournier-Sylvester, an education manager for the Global Centre for Pluralism, in Ottawa, was fourteen at the time. Though she remembers how apoplectic her mother grew upon learning that her parents had voted for Ronald Reagan, she never heard her talk about meeting Bobby Kennedy. She’d learned of that only after happening upon Breslin’s column among her grandmother’s personal effects, and from picking up a Kennedy biography at a book fair in Martha’s Vineyard.\n\nAll these years later, she told me, her mother’s life in politics remains elusive to her. But did she recognize the firebrand Breslin described? “One hundred and fifty per cent,” she replied. She recalled her mother chastising her for wearing earrings shaped like peace signs without bothering to learn what they represented. “She had no patience for frivolity and wanted me to understand the importance of taking clear and informed positions,” she said. “For better or worse, she was frank. Some people didn’t experience it in a positive way. But, luckily, Robert Kennedy did.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d924a08312cd3aa6d47","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d924a08312cd3aa6d47","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Robert F.

Although the train in question is the one that,\nalmost fifty years ago, carried Robert Kennedy’s body from New York City\nto Washington, D.C., for burial in Arlington Cemetery, the show is not\nabout Kennedy. The show is about death—or, more exactly, about the\nrelationship between photography and death.\n\nThat relationship has always been intimate. “Photography,” Barthes\nwrites in “Camera Lucida,” “is a kind of primitive theatre, a kind of *Tableau Vivant*, \na figuration of the motionless and made-up face\nbeneath which we see the dead.” Life is motion, and film is about\nmotion: it was to study motion that film technology was invented. But\nphotography immobilizes. Photographs snatch people out of time. And we\ntake pictures to memorialize. We imagine one day looking at them when\nthe people in them are no longer alive. Even when you look at a photo of\nsome random person, anyone, taken years ago, somewhere in your mind the\nthought creeps in: “And that person is probably now dead.”\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5abeb2d97f666f5c63dc207e]||||||\n+++\n\nRobert Kennedy is now dead. He was shot in the head at 12:15 *A.M.*{:.small}, on\nJune 5, 1968, in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel, in Los Angeles,\nmoments after declaring victory in the California Democratic primary. He\nhad been campaigning for President for not even three months. He never\nregained consciousness and died the following day. His body was flown to\nNew York City, where, on June 8th, a funeral was held at St. Patrick’s\nCathedral. Immediately afterward, the casket was put on a train to\nWashington.\n\nThe heart of the *SFMOMA*{:.small} show is a set of twenty-one photographs taken\nfrom aboard that train by a photographer named Paul Fusco. It was a\nlast-minute assignment from *Look*, where Fusco was a staff\nphotographer, and he assumed that his main task would be in Arlington,\nwhere Kennedy was to be buried next to his brother John. But when the\ntrain emerged from the Hudson River tunnel, Fusco was amazed to see\npeople lining the tracks. He found a spot at an open window, and, for\nthe eight hours it took the train to get to Washington, he shot picture\nafter picture of the crowds who came out to witness Kennedy’s body being\ncarried to its grave.\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5abeb2e12428ba58b34b1a06]||||||\n+++\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5abeb2e00dfee959fdae8650]||||||\n+++\n\nThose pictures eventually became some the most famous works of\nphotojournalism from what was a golden age, the era of the big\nmass-circulation picture magazines: *Life*, *Look*, *The Saturday\nEvening Post*, *Paris Match*, and *Stern*. Fusco carried three cameras\nwith him on the train: two Leica rangefinder cameras and a Nikon S.L.R.\nFor almost all of the shots, he used Kodachrome film, and he took around\na thousand pictures. By the end of the journey, as dusk fell, his\nexposure times were up to one second.\n\nTrains in the Northeast corridor do not run through upscale\nneighborhoods. The people who spontaneously turned out to watch the\nfuneral train pass by—Kennedy’s biographer Evan Thomas says there were a\nmillion—were, by appearance, mostly working class, and there were whites\nand African-Americans often standing in clusters together. In 2018,\nlooking back at those images, as the train approaches the terminal and\nthe light begins to fade, you realize that you are watching the final\nhours of the great Democratic coalition that had dominated American\npolitics since the election of Franklin Roosevelt, in 1932—the coalition\nthat would fracture six months later with the election of Richard Nixon,\nand which is now as dead as Robert Kennedy.\n\n+++feature-large\n[#image: /photos/5abeb2e0a00a37525c81c68b]||||||\n\n+++\n\nFusco’s photographs are amazing in pretty much every way. Technically,\nthe Kodachrome film produces a highly saturated image. It was a hot day,\nbut it was June, and the light—Fusco seems to have been shooting people\non the west side of the tracks, which must have been a challenge as the\nsun dropped in the sky—is an almost palpable, weighty presence.\n\nAs for the faces themselves, it was emotion that brought people out to\nstand waiting, sometimes for hours, beside the tracks in the heat—and\nthose emotions are legible. Fusco must have realized that it was faces\nthat he wanted, and he compensated for the movement of the train by\nfocussing on a single person and moving his camera while he pressed the\nshutter, so that individual faces are often captured in focus against a\nslightly blurred background. There is a nakedness in them that is rare\nin public—these people don’t think that anyone is looking at them—a\nnakedness that many photographers have tried to capture. It’s here.\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5abeb2e1562c295ad5ba9d4b]||||||\n\n+++\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5abeb2e1da80355baf10d2d9]||||||\n\n+++\n\n+++inline-ad\n\nadvertisement\n\n+++\n\nAll but two of Fusco’s photographs remained unpublished for thirty\nyears. This seems to have been a consequence of the fact that *Look* was\na biweekly publication and its main competitor, *Life*, was a weekly, so\nthat by the time the next issue of *Look* came out, Kennedy’s funeral\nhad been covered already elsewhere. *Look* printed two of Fusco’s\npictures, in black and white.\n\nThe photographs remained largely unknown until 1998, the thirtieth\nanniversary of the assassination, when a selection was published in\n*George*, the political and life-style monthly founded and edited by\nJohn Kennedy, Jr., Robert’s nephew (who would die, in the crash of a\nplane he was piloting, a year later). Some of the images were published\nin small-press books in 1999, and then, in 2008, on the fortieth\nanniversary, they were published by *Aperture*, and that edition brought\nthem to the attention of other photographers and artists.\n\n+++feature-medium\n+++group-2\n\n[#image: /photos/5ac25125da3a2c4d72c7a2af]||||||\n[#image: /photos/5ac24d0a2b7d7737ba5d6fe8]||||||\n\n+++\n+++\n\nWhat’s clever about the *SFMOMA*{:.small} show, which is curated by Clément\nChéroux and Linde Lehtinen, is that it supplements Fusco’s pictures with two riffs on them.\nThe first is by the Dutch artist Rein Jelle Terpstra, who was inspired\nby the 2008 *Aperture* edition and realized that many of the people\nFusco photographed from the train were holding cameras themselves. They\nwere taking pictures, too. Terpstra spent four years tracking down many\nof these amateur photographers and collecting their snapshots, slides,\nand home movies.\n\nThe images are technically completely different from Fusco’s prints. The\ncolors in the snapshots are faded, and the images on the slides are\ntiny. The work is almost conceptual: it’s the adventure of recovering\nthe pictures, not the pictures themselves, that make the art experience.\nThe most striking images are Super 8 movies (digitized for the show) of\nthe great black train itself, a slightly chilling reminder that this is\na state funeral we are watching.\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5ac3ea77c53fd02ae32a3bca]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe other riff was made in 2009 by the French artist Philippe Parreno: a\nre-creation of the train journey. Parreno hired people to dress in\nperiod clothing and stand by the side of a railroad track, and then\nfilmed them from a passing train. The movie he produced is about seven\nminutes long.\n\nThis should not have worked, but it does. For technical reasons, Parreno\nended up shooting a lot of his movie in California, and the landscape is\nobviously West Coast. The wrong-side-of-the-tracks aura of the crowds in\nthe original photos, despite the costumes, is missing. But, by shooting\non 70-mm. film, Parreno captured the effects of light that make Fusco’s\nimages so lush.\n\n+++feature-large\n[#image: /photos/5abeb2e2fbbf3443df1178dc]||||||\n\n+++\n\nParreno also understood what Fusco was trying to do with the faces, and\nhe managed, rather brilliantly, to embed photographic images,\nessentially still-lifes, within the cinematic medium. He did this by\nhaving his “actors” remain completely still, so that they seem frozen in\ntime, as the train rumbles along and the trees blow in the wind. They\nare like apparitions. It is as though, fifty years later, Kennedy’s\nwitnesses have come back, as they once were. When the train has passed,\nthey will disappear again. And so, not too long from now, will we. A\nspooky ending to an unusual show.\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5abeb764fbbf3443df117938]||||||\n\n+++\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5abeb2e30dfee959fdae8652]||||||\n\n+++","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c78e56e652c90274658","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Photography","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"photography"},{"id":"5c2e1d924a08312cd3aa6d47","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Robert F.

Kennedy, then a candidate for President, rode in silence to a rally in a predominantly black neighborhood in Indianapolis. Kennedy scribbled a few words onto a legal pad, but mostly he just stared out the window. [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://www.newyorker.com/books/double-take/martin-luther-king-jr-in-the-new-yorker), had been killed in Memphis earlier that evening. When Kennedy heard the news, aboard his campaign plane, his head snapped back as if he himself had been struck; then he buried his face in his hands. Later, as his car arrived at the rally, his staff scanned the periphery of the park for snipers. \n\nLooking shaken, Kennedy climbed onto a flatbed truck to address the crowd. Many had not heard the news about King; they had been waiting in the park for hours, holding “Kennedy” signs. He asked them to put the signs down. “I have some very sad news for all of you,” he said. “And I think some sad news for all of our fellow-citizens and people who love peace all over the world. And that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight, in Memphis, Tennessee.” \n\nThe crowd convulsed. People fell to their knees and wept. But as Kennedy spoke they became quieter and moved closer to him. “For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people,” he [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCrx_u3825g), “I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my own family killed, but he was killed by a white man.”\n\nHe went on: “What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who suffer in our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of his world. Let us dedicate ourselves to that, and say a prayer for our country and for our people.”\n\n[#cneembed: script/video/5ac2a2f5dbc85823b3000018.js?muted=1]||||||\n\nKennedy’s speech was itself a prayer, a quiet plea for a shared understanding. Its wellsprings were deep in Kennedy’s own experience, after the murder of his brother, John Kennedy, in 1963; the grief he had carried in the years since; all that he had come to understand about the roots of black unrest, the depths of black frustration with the political process, and the growing focus of black communities on self-determination. In Indianapolis, Kennedy had spoken from the heart, without notes, and expected to leave it at that; he planned to suspend his campaign until after King’s funeral. But John Lewis, among other civil-rights leaders, urged him to keep a scheduled appearance the next day at the City Club of Cleveland, and to use the occasion to make a more pointed case for the principle of nonviolence—against a backdrop of rioting and looting that had broken out that night in nearly every major American city except, it turned out, Indianapolis.\n\nIf the Indianapolis speech was a lament, the speech he gave in Cleveland was an indictment—delivered more in sorrow than in anger, but just barely. That morning, April 5th, Kennedy sat down for an interview with Jack Paar, who asked what his reaction had been to King’s assassination. “That more and more people are turning to violence,” Kennedy replied. “And in the last analysis it’s going to destroy our country.” His remarks at the City Club were an elaboration on that theme.\n\nThe audience—mostly white, mostly businessmen—sat in silence as Kennedy condemned “the mindless menace of violence&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;which again stains our land and every one of our lives” and asked why America should continue to “make it easy for men of all shades of sanity to acquire whatever weapons and ammunition they desire.” He continued, “Too often we honor swagger and bluster and the wielders of force; too often we excuse those who are willing to build their own lives on the shattered dreams of others.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;Some look for scapegoats, others look for conspiracies, but this much is clear: violence breeds violence, repression brings retaliation, and only a cleansing of our society can remove this sickness from our land.” He spoke, too, of “the violence of institutions: indifference and inaction and slow decay.” He saw “no final answers.” Yet, he said, “we know what we must do.”\n\nThat exhortation, today, is hard to hear. Two months later, Kennedy, as we know, [lost his life](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/robert-f-kennedys-funeral-train-fifty-years-later) to that menace—as had his brother, as had King, and as have many thousands of other “human beings whom other human beings loved needed,” as R.F.K. said in Cleveland. We still know what we must do. Kennedy’s question to us, which hangs in the air half a century later, is when we will finally bring ourselves to do it.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d924a08312cd3aa6d47","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Robert F.

Johnson had gone on television at nine o’clock that evening to address the nation on the war in Vietnam. It was not going well. In the past three years, the United States had dropped more tons of bombs on Vietnam than were dropped by all the belligerents combined in the Second World War. Twenty thousand Americans had died there, four thousand in the previous two months, following a surprise attack, known as the Tet Offensive, by North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces. Enemy losses were much higher, but that only made the war seem more horrific and out of control.\n\nI was at home, sitting in the basement, where we kept our television set, listening to Johnson’s speech with my father. He was standing with his back to the screen, so that he would not have to look at Johnson. He was protesting Johnson’s policy on Vietnam. The only person present in the basement to appreciate the symbolism was me.\n\nMy father had already registered his opposition in a more substantive way. He had been working in Washington, D.C., for one of Johnson’s anti-poverty programs, but he had resigned because he felt he couldn’t work for an Administration that was propping up autocratic regimes in Saigon and napalming the Vietnamese. So we had moved back to Massachusetts, where he took a lesser job with, I assume, a lower salary.\n\nIn his address, Johnson announced a reduction of American air strikes and said that he would seek a negotiated settlement, but he also said that he was sending more troops. Then he said, “I have concluded that I should not permit the Presidency to become involved in the partisan divisions that are developing in this political year.” My father perked up. He did not, however, turn around. “Accordingly,” Johnson went on, “I shall not seek and I will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your President.”\n\n“He’s not running!” my father shouted to my mother, who was upstairs. She had refused even to listen to Johnson. That’s the kind of house I grew up in. “He’s not running!”\n\nFor antiwar liberals like my parents, who had marched in Washington the previous October in a giant demonstration organized by a group known as the Mobe (National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam), Johnson was a monster who had betrayed liberalism, and the knight who slayed him was Eugene McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy was the senior senator from Minnesota, a liberal anti-Communist whose roots, like my parents’, were in New Deal politics. Unlike my parents, McCarthy had a spiritual side. As a young man, he had entered a monastery under the name Brother Conan but was kicked out for the sin of intellectual pride. McCarthy had always had a bit of _contemptus mundi_ about him. Turning your back to the television set was the kind of gesture he would have understood.\n\nIn the beginning, McCarthy was a single-issue candidate. He was a dove. He ran against continued American military intervention in Vietnam. But he was also offended by the Administration’s insistence that its war powers were absolute, and by its increasingly transparent lies about the progress of the war. He had come to see the Administration as a danger to democracy. He was an enemy of what used to be called “the imperial Presidency.”\n\nAs unpopular as Johnson was in 1968 with Democrats like my parents, he was a man politicians thought twice about crossing. He had won the 1964 Presidential election, against Barry Goldwater, with the highest percentage of the popular vote in American history, and he knew how to squeeze his opponents. Even Democrats in Congress who knew that Johnson was driving the country off a cliff—and by the end of 1967, when four hundred and eighty-five thousand Americans were stationed in Vietnam, the folly of intervention had become plain—were loath to break with him publicly. But McCarthy did. In November, 1967, he announced that he was entering the Democratic Presidential primaries. He was running against a sitting President of his own party. Many people thought that he had committed hara-kiri—a noble act, possibly, but politically insane.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe New Hampshire primary, held on March 12, 1968, made those people think again. It wasn’t because McCarthy did especially well. Johnson’s name was not on the Democratic ballot, but he won easily as a write-in candidate, with forty-nine per cent of the Democratic vote. McCarthy got forty-two per cent, despite the fact that his name was the only name on the ballot, and even though he had five thousand New Hampshire students and two thousand out-of-state volunteers canvassing the state for him. McCarthy received about twenty-two thousand Democratic votes, roughly three votes for every campaign worker.\n\nIn national politics, twenty-two thousand was not an intimidating number of votes—twenty-two thousand people would not even fill half of Yankee Stadium—and New Hampshire was not a state that Democrats needed to carry. In the previous five Presidential elections, it had voted Republican four times. (The exception was the Johnson landslide in 1964.) The winner of the Republican primary, Richard Nixon, got eighty-four thousand votes, thirty thousand more than Johnson and McCarthy combined. But blood was in the water, and four days later, on March 16th, Robert F. Kennedy, the junior senator from New York, declared his candidacy.\n\nIf Kennedy hadn’t entered the race, Johnson could have fended off McCarthy. In 1968, the primaries played a minor role in the delegate-selection process. Thirty-six states did not even hold them. The parties controlled the process. The man who eventually won the Democratic nomination, Hubert Humphrey, Johnson’s Vice-President, did not enter a single primary.\n\nRobert Kennedy is one of the great what-ifs of American political history. In 1968, he was just forty-two years old. He had the most glamorous name in politics; he wore the mantle of martyrdom; and he had transformed himself from a calculating infighter—he had managed his brother’s Presidential campaign, in 1960, and served as his Attorney General after the election—into a kind of existentialist messiah. At the 1964 Democratic National Convention, in Atlantic City, he had received a twenty-two-minute standing ovation just by appearing at the lectern.\n\nThere was a rawness in Kennedy’s face and voice that seemed to match the national mood. He was the personification of the country’s pain over its fallen leader. And he had the ability to reflect back whatever voters projected onto him. He seemed to combine youth with experience, intellect with heart, street sense with vision. He was a hero to Chicano grape pickers, to inner-city African-Americans, to union workers. He was a man of the times when the times they were a-changin’. Kennedy had haters. Having haters is part of the job of being a messiah. But he was salvific. He could rouse audiences to a frenzy and he could make hardened politicos weep. People thought that he could go to the Convention and steal the nomination from Johnson. People thought that he could beat Nixon.\n\nJohnson was not salvific. “Waist deep in the Big Muddy, and the big fool says to push on,” I heard Pete Seeger sing in Washington in 1967\\. It’s a song about a platoon in the Second World War, but everyone knew who the big fool was. The line was electric. Pete was a sing-along performer, and the liberal audience (who else would be at a Pete Seeger concert?) roared it out.\n\nIt was as though they had forgotten that Johnson had pushed through two major pieces of civil-rights legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made discrimination by race or religion or sex illegal, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which guaranteed the franchise to African-Americans in the formerly segregated South. Those were the greatest legal advances in race relations since the Civil War amendments. But by 1968 Vietnam had eclipsed them.\n\nJohnson had no experience in foreign policy. Much as Harry Truman had done, in 1947 and 1948, he allowed the generals and the policy hawks to convince him of a central fallacy of Cold War thinking: that America’s standing was at stake in every regime change around the world. He did not want to be the President who lost Southeast Asia to Communism.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5a3bfe085e8c9840cf2544a0]||||||\n+++\n\nBy 1968, Johnson’s Great Society programs—legislation on education, health care, urban renewal, and transportation whose scope rivalled that of the New Deal—were dying because of the cost of the war, and he had imposed a ten-per-cent income surtax, a dependable way to become unpopular with just about everybody. Inflation, which had been low for most of the postwar era, had reached four per cent. (It went much higher: the country was on the brink of an economic retrenchment that took fifteen years to work through.)\n\nThe message of New Hampshire, therefore, was not that McCarthy was the answer to the nation’s troubles. It was that Johnson was the face of what many voters wanted to get away from. New Hampshire did not make McCarthy seem electable so much as it made Johnson seem beatable. That was the message that Kennedy had been waiting to hear, and he wasted little time jumping into the race. He was accused, rightly, of opportunism.\n\nAlthough Johnson had served as John F. Kennedy’s Vice-President, there was no love lost between him and the Kennedys. He was not cut out for a part in Camelot. Colonel Cornpone, Jackie Kennedy used to call him. At the first Cabinet meeting after J.F.K. was assassinated, Robert arrived late, and everyone in the room rose as a sign of respect, except for Johnson. Five years later, Johnson was losing one war overseas; he could not engage on a second front at home. So, on March 31st, two weeks after Kennedy entered the race, Johnson made my father, briefly, a happy man.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAfter March 31st, the primaries became a mano a mano between Kennedy and McCarthy. As a campaigner, Kennedy was hot and McCarthy was cool, but McCarthy did not suffer from the contrast, at least among white liberals. He had established his own aura, the aura of the samurai: unswerving and ascetic.\n\nOn May 28th, he defeated Kennedy in the Oregon primary. It was the first time in twenty-seven consecutive races that any Kennedy had lost an election. On June 4th, Kennedy rebounded and won the big one, California. Minutes after declaring victory, he was shot in the Ambassador Hotel, in Los Angeles. He died on June 6th, along with the seeds of whatever future America he carried within him.\n\nAll the antiwar fury in the Democratic Party could now focus its hopes on McCarthy. I went with my family to see him on July 25th at an enormous rally at Fenway Park, in Boston. McCarthy’s wife, Abigail, who was closely involved in the campaign, defined McCarthy’s constituency as “academia united with the mobile society of scientists, educators, technologists and the new post-World-War II college class.” If that was your base in 1968, Fenway Park was the ideal place to address it.\n\nAlmost forty thousand people were jammed into a stadium whose official capacity is under thirty-eight thousand; five thousand more listened outside. McCarthy was introduced by Leonard Bernstein, a man practiced in podium histrionics. I can still hear him cuing McCarthy’s entrance—“Even now, entering from the center-field bleachers . . .” A door opened under the stands, and McCarthy walked across the field to a speaker’s platform at second base.\n\nMcCarthy had adopted the rhetoric of revolution. It was to be a revolution of reason and common sense, of course; McCarthy was a Midwesterner and a Catholic. He loathed the yippies and the student radicals; his student volunteers were encouraged to go “clean for Gene.” But the language of revolution was what you used to mobilize antiwar liberals in 1968\\. So McCarthy spoke at Fenway about the “power of the people” and called his campaign “a kind of uprising.”\n\nMcCarthy had a wry and slightly professorial tone. “Almost everything that the Church tried to give up at the Vatican Council has been picked up by the Defense Department,” he said at one point. I don’t think that line would have meant much in Cleveland, but it received knowing chortles and applause in Boston.\n\nHe got his loudest and most sustained reaction when he mentioned the Convention, then one month away, in Chicago. “Any visit to Chicago is always beset with some uncertainties, some dangers,” he said (applause indicating that understatement was always appreciated), “but I think that we shall succeed there.” He said it in the most nonchalant tone of voice imaginable, but the cheers went on and on.\n\nThose were the cheers of desperation, tribute to a valiant effort doomed to come up short. Everyone at Fenway knew that McCarthy did not have the delegates. He would have to inspire a stampede at the Convention to rip the nomination from Humphrey, who stood to inherit Johnson’s delegates. In the minds of everyone who was old enough, there probably flickered the memory of a speech that McCarthy had delivered at the 1960 Democratic Convention, putting Adlai Stevenson’s name in nomination. “Do not leave this prophet without honor in his own party,” McCarthy had said, setting off a floor demonstration that threatened to steal the Convention from J.F.K. But lightning was not likely to strike twice, and in 1960 Kennedy won on the first ballot, anyway.\n\nWe watched every minute of the 1968 Convention in our basement, and there were some very late nights. What everyone remembers are the attacks by police and National Guardsmen on demonstrators in the streets outside. In fact, the networks did not devote much time to covering those. Out of thirty-eight hours of Convention coverage, CBS devoted thirty-two minutes to the demonstrators. NBC devoted fourteen minutes out of nineteen hours of coverage.\n\nBut the scene inside the hall—the Chicago Amphitheatre, on the South Side, near the stockyards—was tumultuous enough. The CBS reporters Dan Rather and Mike Wallace were roughed up by security personnel. After a vote on an antiwar platform plank failed, members of the New York delegation joined arms and sang “We Shall Overcome.” When Senator Abraham Ribicoff, of Connecticut, was giving a speech, the mayor of Chicago, Richard Daley, shouted at him, “Fuck you, you Jew son of a bitch, you lousy motherfucker, go home.”\n\nThe antiwar delegates lost every battle. A last-minute attempt to draft Edward Kennedy was aborted, and Humphrey won the nomination on the first ballot, with some seventeen hundred delegates, eight hundred and forty-seven more than the rest of the field.\n\nThe Convention left the Party fractured. McCarthy refused to endorse Humphrey, who began the fall campaign far behind in the polls. “Right now, you’re dead,” his campaign manager, Lawrence O’Brien, told him. He did come back, and nearly made up the difference. At the end of September, he at last broke with Johnson and announced that he would halt the bombing. At the end of October, McCarthy finally endorsed Humphrey. It was not quite enough. On November 5th, something happened that would have been unthinkable a few years earlier: Richard Nixon was elected President.\n\nThe story of this election has been told in many books, from Theodore H. White’s “[The Making of the President 1968](https://www.amazon.com/Making-President-1968-Landmark-Political/dp/0061900648/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1513962101&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Making+of+the+President+1968)” and Lewis Chester, Godfrey Hodgson, and Bruce Page’s mammoth “[An American Melodrama](https://www.amazon.com/American-Melodrama-Presidential-Campaign-1968/dp/B000NPZ5SE/ref=tmm_mmp_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1513962134&sr=1-1),” both published in 1969, to Michael A. Cohen’s “[American Maelstrom](https://www.amazon.com/American-Maelstrom-Election-Politics-Division/dp/019977756X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1513962167&sr=1-1&keywords=American+Maelstrom),” which came out in 2016\\. It is featured in classic histories of the postwar period, including Hodgson’s “[America in Our Time](https://www.amazon.com/America-Our-Time-Godfrey-Hodgson/dp/0385115725/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1513962190&sr=1-1&keywords=America+in+Our+Time),” Allen J. Matusow’s “[The Unraveling of America](https://www.amazon.com/Unraveling-America-History-Liberalism-1960s/dp/0820334057/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1513962223&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Unraveling+of+America+matusow),” G. Calvin MacKenzie and Robert Weisbrot’s “[The Liberal Hour](https://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Hour-Washington-Politics-American/dp/0143115464/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1513962241&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Liberal+Hour),” and Todd Gitlin’s “[The Sixties](https://www.amazon.com/Sixties-Years-Hope-Days-Rage/dp/0553372122/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1513962265&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Sixties+gitlin).” The story of the 1968 Presidential election is like oral poetry, a saga passed down from bard to bard that no one (or no one of a certain age, maybe) seems to tire of hearing.\n\nLawrence O’Donnell’s “[Playing with Fire: The 1968 Election and the Transformation of American Politics](https://www.amazon.com/Playing-Fire-Election-Transformation-American/dp/0399563148/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1513962284&sr=1-1&keywords=Playing+with+Fire%3A+The+1968+Election+and+the+Transformation+of+American+Politics)” (Penguin) is the latest in this string of recitations. O’Donnell is the host of “The Last Word,” on MSNBC; he has worked on Capitol Hill, and he was a writer and producer for “The West Wing.” His book relies almost entirely on published sources, and so it adds little to what we know. But he is a talented storyteller, and his analysis of campaign tactics is sharp.\n\nAnd the story of that election still matters. In 1968, Americans elected a man with some savvy and no principles. In 2016, they elected a man with neither. O’Donnell’s book makes it a little easier to understand how we got from there to here. It turns out that the distance is not all that great.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAmericans tend to overread Presidential elections. It’s not that the results aren’t consequential. It matters which party, and which person in which party, is in the White House. The mistake is to interpret the election as an index of public opinion (itself something of a Platonic abstraction).\n\nIn close elections, such as those of 1960, 1968, and 1976, the vote is essentially the equivalent of flipping a coin. If the voting had happened a week earlier or a week later or on a rainy day, the outcome might have been reversed. But we interpret the result as though it reflected the national intention, a collective decision by the people to rally behind R., and repudiate D. Even when the winner receives fewer votes than the loser, as in 2000 and 2016, we talk about the national mood and direction almost entirely in terms of the winning candidate, and as though the person more voters preferred had vanished, his or her positions barely worth reporting on.\n\nMillions more Americans voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and in 2012 and for Hillary Clinton in 2016 than voted for Donald Trump, but the Trump voter is now the protagonist of the national narrative. People talk about how Americans want to roll back globalization—even though most Americans who voted appear to want no such thing. The United States is one of the few democracies that does not have a coalition government, and a winner-take-all electoral system breeds a winner-take-all punditry.\n\nThe winner-take-all interpretation of the 1968 election was that, with the defeat of Hubert Humphrey, the nation repudiated liberalism. The election supposedly marked the demise of an ideological consensus that had dominated national politics since Franklin Roosevelt’s election in 1932 and that made politically possible the use of government programs to remedy the inequities of free-market capitalism.\n\nBut did Humphrey lose because he was a liberal, or because he ran a tone-deaf campaign? “Here we are, the way politics ought to be in America, the politics of happiness, the politics of purpose, and the politics of joy,” he chirped in the speech in which he announced his candidacy. The date was April 27, 1968\\. Martin Luther King, Jr., had been assassinated three weeks before. It was a bizarre moment to introduce a phrase like “the politics of joy.” And although Johnson had just been forced to withdraw from the race by two candidates who opposed his Vietnam policy, Humphrey did not mention Vietnam in the speech.\n\nEven after he had the nomination in hand, he seemed reluctant to dissociate himself from a policy with which the electorate had clearly lost patience. Yet the popular vote was surprisingly close. The margin was eight hundred thousand votes, seven-tenths of one per cent of the total. Some of the Democratic base did not turn out, and some Democrats—my mother was one—voted but did not check a box for President (another symbolic protest performed for a local audience). Humphrey got twelve million fewer votes than Johnson did in 1964, and he still nearly won a plurality. It’s hard to believe that twelve million people consciously embraced liberalism in 1964 and consciously rejected it four years later.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nO’Donnell argues that the lesson of 1968 is that “the peace movement won.” And although his McCarthy is not an entirely sympathetic figure—he relies considerably on Dominic Sandbrook’s 2004 biography, in which McCarthy comes off as sour and aloof—he is the hero of O’Donnell’s story. “The last word about Gene McCarthy,” he says, “should always be that no one did more to stop the killing in Vietnam than Senator Eugene McCarthy.”\n\nThis seems a stretch for any number of reasons, the most obvious being that McCarthy lost, and that the war continued for seven more years. Nixon didn’t want to be the President who lost Southeast Asia to Communism any more than Johnson did, and he had no idea how to end the war, either. More than a third of all the Americans killed in Vietnam were killed during his Presidency.\n\nIt wasn’t as though Nixon was winding things down. In 1970, he extended the war into Cambodia. In the last of the major campus disruptions, protesting students were killed at Kent State, in Ohio, and at Jackson State College, in Mississippi. In 1972, after running again on a promise to end the war, Nixon ordered the so-called Christmas bombing of North Vietnam: in the course of twelve days, some seven hundred and forty sorties by B-52s dropped twenty thousand tons of bombs. Sixteen hundred Vietnamese were estimated to have been killed.\n\nThe purpose of the Christmas bombing was to pressure North Vietnam to negotiate an end to the fighting, which finally happened in 1973\\. But, in 1975, the North Vietnamese marched into Saigon and united the country under Communist rule, exactly the outcome that France and the United States had been fighting to prevent for thirty years. By then, Nixon had resigned and Gerald Ford was President. When O’Donnell writes that “the peace movement drove U.S. forces out of Vietnam, not the North Vietnamese Army,” he is making the same mistake that every Administration made: imagining that it was decisions taken by Americans that determined the fate of Vietnam.\n\nO’Donnell thinks that the nomination of Nixon marked the end of liberalism, at least in the Republican Party. That’s quite right: a certain type of Republican politician, the type represented by Nelson Rockefeller (the governor of New York, who ran a poorly mounted and hopelessly belated campaign against Nixon), George Romney (the governor of Michigan, who knocked himself out of the Republican primaries early by telling a reporter that he had been “brainwashed” about Vietnam), and John Lindsay (the mayor of New York, who some foolishly hoped might be Nixon’s Vice-Presidential pick), largely disappeared from the Party after 1968\\. But that leaves a question: Why didn’t their supporters become Democrats? This is where the diagnosis becomes complicated.\n\nPeople who write and argue about politics are ideologues. They hold a coherent set of positions that they identify as liberal or conservative (or some variant, like libertarian or leftist). But, to millions of voters, those terms mean almost nothing. These voters do not think in ideological terms, and their positions on the issues are often inconsistent and lacking in coherence. Given the option, they will sometimes identify as moderates or centrists, but this tells us very little about how they will vote.\n\nThe fact that voters are often responding to nonideological cues helps to explain the apparent volatility of the electorate from race to race. In 1964, for example, running against Goldwater, a conservative from Arizona, Johnson carried the neighboring state of California with fifty-nine per cent of the vote. Two years later, running as a conservative who had prominently backed Goldwater in 1964, Ronald Reagan was elected governor of California with almost fifty-eight per cent of the vote. In the 1968 Presidential election, forty per cent of the people who had voted for Johnson in 1964 voted for Nixon, even though Nixon’s opponent was Johnson’s own Vice-President. What cues were these voters responding to?\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAfter Nixon’s victory, two books, both of which became enormously influential, proposed explanations. According to “[The Real Majority](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Majority-Examination-American-Electorate/dp/1556112971/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1513963151&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Real+Majority),” by Richard Scammon and Ben Wattenberg, the 1968 election proved that, particularly in a time of extremes like the late nineteen-sixties, centrism was the winning position. Nixon got to the center, while Humphrey and the Democrats remained associated with the extremes.\n\nCentrism requires a delicate balancing act, which Nixon, a man with many innate liabilities as a politician, turned out to be extremely good at. He opposed the Johnson-Humphrey Administration’s policy on the war, but had no policy of his own. (Nixon never made the claim, often attributed to him, that he had a “secret plan to end the war.” That phrase was invented by a reporter.) As long as the war was going badly, people who favored withdrawal and people who favored escalation both found in Nixon a congenial alternative.\n\nAt the same time, Nixon figured out a position to run on. He became the candidate of “law and order.” Goldwater had used that expression in 1964, and so had Reagan in 1966\\. It was a brilliant political slogan, a whistle heard by many dogs. It transposed political issues like civil rights and Vietnam into what appeared to be a straightforward legal position: crime is wrong and criminals should be punished.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5a3bfe0887d5a401c2085629]||||||\n+++\n\nTo liberals who believed in the righteousness of the civil-rights demonstrations and the antiwar protests, the disruption and violence that accompanied them was caused by the overreaction of the authorities. For most voters, though, the disruption and violence were the fault of the demonstrators. Most people don’t like righteousness in others. They can be quite righteous about it.\n\nFor these voters, it was not a contradiction to profess support for racial equality and to condemn the marchers in Birmingham and Selma, or to be against the war in Vietnam and to believe that people like Tom Hayden and Abbie Hoffman should be locked up. In polls taken in 1968, only three per cent of voters who objected to Johnson’s policy in Vietnam were also sympathetic to antiwar protesters. My parents were part of the three per cent.\n\nPolitically, the most important event in the United States in 1968 was, therefore, the assassination, on April 4th, of Martin Luther King. Riots broke out in more than a hundred cities. Thirty-nine people died and twenty thousand were arrested. More than fifty thousand troops were deployed. Washington, D.C., became a war zone. In Newark, New Jersey, there were nearly two hundred fires. Large numbers of white Americans did not interpret this disorder in terms of social justice. They interpreted it as a breakdown of civil society. The rioters were not black or white; they were arsonists and looters (who happened to be black). Nixon showed that political advantage came from steering clear of the underlying issues. He gave people respectable reasons to vote for a candidate they favored for what they might have worried were not such respectable reasons.\n\nThe second influential post-1968 book was Kevin Phillips’s “[The Emerging Republican Majority](https://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Republican-Majority-American-Politics/dp/0691163243/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1513963175&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Emerging+Republican+Majority),” published in 1969\\. This is the book that popularized what became known as the Southern Strategy. Like Scammon and Wattenberg, Phillips saw that millions of voters were repelled by what they regarded as extremism, but he gave a name to what he thought was the key issue. He called it “the Negro problem.”\n\nThe big news electorally in 1964 was that a Republican carried five Southern states: Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, and South Carolina. It was the first time those states had not gone Democratic since Reconstruction, and the reason was not obscure. The voting was white backlash against the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which Senator Goldwater had voted against. Goldwater was not a segregationist; he was a states’-rights conservative. But he flipped the South to the Republican Party.\n\nThe key to exploiting this shift in party alignment, as Nixon understood, was not to oppose the civil-rights movement but to force the Democratic Party to take ownership of it. The Kennedys had seen the perils in that, and they had been extremely careful about not appearing to be too close to King. But Johnson effectively put his personal brand on the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, and the Party thus had to take on the baggage of the urban rioting and the militancy of groups like the Black Panthers. Republicans didn’t have to say a word against integration. All they had to do was talk about law and order.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nStill, Nixon didn’t carry the Deep South in the general election. George Wallace did. And Wallace didn’t use a dog whistle. Wallace was the dog. He was elected governor of Alabama in 1962, a time when the official logo of the Alabama Democratic Party was a rooster with a banner above it reading “White Supremacy.” The next summer, he achieved national recognition when he resisted the attempt to enroll the first black students at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa—the “Stand in the Schoolhouse Door.” (The confrontation was staged, to allow Wallace to make his point in exchange for letting the students enroll. Those students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, were quietly admitted through another door.)\n\nA year later, Wallace ran in the Democratic primaries, and surprised many people by winning a third of the vote in Wisconsin and more than forty per cent in Maryland. In 1968, he ran as an independent, hoping to win enough electoral votes to deny any candidate a majority, giving himself leverage in choosing the next President.\n\nWallace came to Massachusetts several times in the summer of 1968 on drives for signatures to get on the ballot. I heard him on one of those trips. The crowd was small and mostly hostile. What amazed me was that Wallace gave the stump speech he delivered everywhere, which consisted almost entirely of taunts, insults, and threats. He did not reason with his opponents.\n\nHe called professors and Washington bureaucrats “sissy britches” and mocked “the bearded professor who thinks he knows how to settle the Vietnam War when he hasn’t got enough sense to park a bicycle straight.” As President, he said, he would seek indictments for “any college professor who talks about hoping the Vietcong win the war.” He liked to invite hecklers to come up to the stage after his speech. “I’ll autograph your sandals,” he’d say. He told reporters, “I’d let the police run this country for a couple of years. I’m not talking about a police state, but sometimes it takes a police state to run some people.” Voters did not need to be told who “some people” were.\n\nWallace won just three per cent of the vote in Massachusetts, but his act played well across much of the country, where he spoke to boisterously enthusiastic audiences. After a rally at Madison Square Garden, supporters marched out chanting “White supremacy!” People told reporters that they admired him because “he says what he thinks.”\n\nLate in the race, one of the reporters who covered Wallace, Douglas Kiker, tried to explain the phenomenon. “It is as if somewhere, sometime a while back, George Wallace had been awakened by a white, blinding vision: they all hate black people, all of them,” Kiker wrote in _New York_. “They’re all afraid, all of them. Great God! That’s it! They’re all Southern! The whole United States is Southern! Anyone who travels with Wallace these days on his Presidential campaign finds it hard to resist arriving at the same conclusion.”\n\nWallace’s big mistake, late in the campaign, was to name as his running mate a former general, Curtis LeMay, who advocated the use of nuclear weapons in Vietnam. LeMay terrified everyone, and Wallace ended up with thirteen per cent of the vote. He was also hurt, as Humphrey was hurt, by being seen constantly on television surrounded by angry protesters. Those were the scenes people were voting to get away from. But Wallace carried the Southern states that Goldwater had won in 1964, and, as everyone now recognizes, he offered a taste of demagoguery to come.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nObjects in the rearview mirror often really are closer than they appear. It’s not that far from Wallace to Trump. The focus on Presidential elections makes it hard to see that from one election to the next pretty much the same people are voting, and most people do not change much over time. The Presidency is a beach ball bouncing along the surface, the winner an artifact of the circumstance that there are usually only two candidates to choose between. “Public opinion,” or the forces that move it, runs below the surface, and has a much slower tempo.\n\nIn “[Deeply Divided](https://www.amazon.com/Deeply-Divided-Politics-Movements-Post-War/dp/1511383984/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1513963335&sr=1-1&keywords=Deeply+Divided),” a 2014 study, the political scientists Doug McAdam and Karina Kloos argue that since 1960 our politics has been driven by two movements: the civil-rights movement and what they call a “countermovement,” which could be broadly described as anti-integrationist. It includes racists, but it also includes many white Americans who acknowledge the principle of racial equality but resist involuntary race-mixing, people who accept and even defend de facto segregation. “The collapse of the postwar consensus,” McAdam and Kloos maintain, was not because of Vietnam; it “had everything to do with race.”\n\nWhite voters abandoned the Democratic Party. In 1968, Humphrey got thirty-eight per cent of the white vote. In 1972, George McGovern got thirty-two per cent. In 1980, Jimmy Carter, a white Southerner, got thirty-six per cent. In 2016, Hillary Clinton, running against the toxic nitwit who is now the face of our politics, received thirty-seven per cent.\n\nOne thing that surprised analysts about Wallace voters was how young they were. To most observers during the campaign, it looked as though Wallace was appealing to older voters who were uncomfortable with social change or were unwilling to abandon old prejudices. These observers assumed that the United States would age out of those attitudes as the new day of tolerance and equality brightened. I’m sure we white Massachusetts liberals believed something like that. We thought that racial injustice and American exceptionalism were on history’s dust heap, only given a last breath by the election of Nixon in a crazy and fluky election year. We thought the gains of mid-century liberalism were lasting.\n\nWe were suffering under two delusions. The first was that ending de jure discrimination meant ending discrimination. We know better now about that. The other delusion, though, persists. This is the stereotype of sixties youth as progressive and permissive. There were such young people, of course, and they got a lot of press. But most young people in the nineteen sixties did not march for civil rights or protest the war in Vietnam. They had no sandals to autograph. Like young people in any era, most of them were like their parents. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated Robert Kennedy’s age in 1968\\.

Foundation describes itself as “America’s leading charitable organization in support of the shooting sports.” Each year, the foundation—which is a nonpolitical arm of the National Rifle Association, and can accept tax-deductible contributions—takes in tens of millions of dollars, mostly from small donors. Of that, it steers about twenty million dollars to the N.R.A.’s own gun-safety, training, and hunting programs. The rest goes to gun clubs and ranges, youth shooting groups, and organizations researching the Second Amendment. In a “letter of appreciation” that appeared in the foundation’s 2017 annual report, Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice-president of the N.R.A. and an ex-officio trustee of the foundation, wrote, “On behalf of the entire N.R.A. family, thank you for your dedication and for your generous contributions that keep America safe and free.”\n\nLike all charitable groups, the N.R.A. is required to describe the amount, nature, and recipients of its grants on its annual tax filings. But, between 2013 and 2017, the N.R.A. did not disclose payments to at least one charity—a Christian organization called Youth for Tomorrow, which provides outpatient and inpatient services for children with acute psychological and behavioral problems. Founded in 1986 by the former football coach Joe Gibbs, the charity, which is based in Northern Virginia, is a favorite of conservative élites. It is not an obvious match for the N.R.A. Foundation, but the two groups do have one point of overlap: Wayne LaPierre’s wife, Susan LaPierre, is a longtime member of the Y.F.T. board and, until very recently, was its president.\n\nSusan LaPierre joined the Y.F.T. board in 2009, and served as its president from 2013 to last December, when, according to Gary Jones, Y.F.T’s chief executive officer, she chose not to stand for reëlection. She remains “admired and respected by everyone on the board for her genuine commitment to our vulnerable children,” Jones told me. During the time of her involvement with the charity, the N.R.A. Foundation has sponsored at least seven of its events, including its annual Heart 2 Heart Gala. A formal affair held at the Ritz-Carlton in Tysons Corner, Virginia, the gala features conservative luminaries such as Taya Kyle, the widow of the Navy *SEAL*{:.small} sniper [Chris Kyle](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/03/in-the-crosshairs), and performances by celebrities, including the country singer Alan Jackson and the comedian Jeff Foxworthy. In 2011, the N.R.A. Foundation was described on Facebook as one of the event’s [two leading sponsors](https://www.facebook.com/events/659144340858078/). According to Y.F.T. newsletters and fund-raising brochures, the N.R.A. Foundation served as one of the gala’s top-tier sponsors on at least three more occasions: in 2013, for twenty-five thousand dollars, and in 2016 and 2017, for fifty thousand dollars each year.\n\n----------\n\n*This story was published in partnership with [The Trace](https://www.thetrace.org/2019/05/nra-susan-lapierre-charity-donations/), a nonprofit news organization covering guns in America.*\n\n----------\n\nY.F.T. does not reveal the identity of its donors in its tax filings, a practice that is protected by law. The N.R.A. Foundation, however, faces potential regulatory problems for not disclosing its Y.F.T. event sponsorships, according to two experts on nonprofits. The Internal Revenue Service requires charities not only to report all grants but also to note other forms of “assistance,” including “awards, prizes, contributions, non-cash assistance, cash allocations, stipends, scholarships, fellowships, research grants, and similar payments and distributions.” Philip Hackney, who worked as an attorney in the I.R.S.’s chief counsel’s office from 2006 to 2011, told me, “It’s hard to imagine why the N.R.A. wouldn’t note the sponsorships, since they seem to fall within the spirit of what’s being asked for. Choosing not to raises significant red flags.” The foundation’s support of Y.F.T. also raises concerns about whether it ran afoul of nonprofit conflict-of-interest regulations. An N.R.A. insider, such as the spouse of Wayne LaPierre, cannot benefit from a transaction for no practical reason other than a close connection to the organization. Hackney said, “The question is, Why are they not reporting the payments? Why not be open and upfront about them? Is it because the recipient is closely associated with Susan LaPierre?” \n\nAn N.R.A. spokesman said that the N.R.A. is “a proud supporter of Youth for Tomorrow.” He did not explain why the foundation did not disclose the sponsorship payments but said that they were “endorsed by the audit committee of the board of directors.” The spokesman added that the N.R.A. views its support for Y.F.T. “as an investment in our local community near our N.R.A. headquarters,” in Fairfax, Virginia, and that “the relationships forged through Youth for Tomorrow benefit the N.R.A. in many ways.” \n\nBoard members of charities are generally expected to raise money for their organization. The N.R.A. spokesman noted that Susan LaPierre “is a proud and committed volunteer for the charity, and she invites as many people as she can to join her as supporters.” In 2018, she sent an e-mail on behalf of Y.F.T., pitching recipients on serving as sponsors of the Heart 2 Heart Gala, which would include a performance by the country-music star Brad Paisley. Some of the recipients were N.R.A. venders, who provide political-consulting and fund-raising services for the organization. “I am writing today to ask you to help change a child’s life,” Susan LaPierre wrote, before providing sponsorship information. The lowest sponsorship level was seventy-five hundred dollars. “Your support makes miracles happen every day and your love is changing lives.” At least eight [N.R.A. venders](http://youthfortomorrow.org/news/83) contributed tens of thousands of dollars, combined, to Y.F.T. Tracy and Clinton Key, who are partners in one of the venders, Key & Associates, told me that their family “has been involved with Youth for Tomorrow since its founding.” They acknowledged that “Susan has asked for help,” but said that they have “never been pressured to donate to Y.F.T. by Susan or anyone else.” Seven others did not respond to requests for comment. James Fishman, an expert on nonprofit law and a co-author of “[New York Nonprofit Law and Practice: With Tax Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/New-York-Nonprofit-Law-Practice/dp/1422418162),” told me, “If Susan is looked at as an agent of her husband, then a regulator would say that this is improper. A vender doesn’t want to shoot the goose that’s showering them with golden eggs.” \n\nThe past few months have been an especially fraught time for the N.R.A., as [extensive](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/secrecy-self-dealing-and-greed-at-the-nra) [reporting](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-internal-memo-raises-new-questions-about-self-dealing-at-the-nra) on self-dealing and other forms of financial mismanagement has revealed that hundreds of millions of dollars in spending have enriched senior executives and a small group of venders and individuals close to them. In April, at the N.R.A.’s annual meeting, Oliver North, the organization’s president, tried to oust Wayne LaPierre; the effort failed, and North (who serves on Y.F.T.’s board) resigned. Hours after North’s resignation, Letitia James, the attorney general of New York State, where the N.R.A. is chartered, launched an investigation into the organization’s tax-exempt status. According to Hackney, the Foundation’s sponsorship payments to Y.F.T. will likely provide another line of inquiry for James, who will want to assess whether the transactions “were part of a repeat pattern involving the LaPierres, deliberate concealment, and violations of duty of loyalty to the N.R.A.” If so, Hackney said, “The A.G. can ask for those funds to be returned to the foundation, and potentially have Wayne LaPierre removed as an N.R.A. officer.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1dca81ab3335f580f2ab","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1dca81ab3335f580f2ab","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"National

Association—elk hunters in Montana, skeet shooters in upstate New York, concealed-carry enthusiasts in Jacksonville—might have noticed a desperate tone in the organization’s fund-raising efforts. In a letter from early March, Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.’s top executive, warned that liberal regulators were threatening to destroy the organization. “We’re facing an attack that’s unprecedented not just in the history of the N.R.A. but in the entire history of our country,” he wrote. “The Second Amendment cannot survive without the N.R.A., and the N.R.A. cannot survive without your help right now.”\n\nLaPierre is right that the N.R.A. is troubled; in recent years, it has run annual deficits of as much as forty million dollars. It is not unusual for nonprofits to ask prospective donors to help forestall disaster. What is unusual is the extent to which such warnings have become the central activity of the N.R.A. Even as the association has reduced spending on its avowed core mission—gun education, safety, and training—to less than ten per cent of its total budget, it has substantially increased its spending on messaging. The N.R.A. is now mainly a media company, promoting a life style built around loving guns and hating anyone who might take them away.\n\nOn NRATV, the organization’s programming network, the popular host Grant Stinchfield might appear in a “Socialist Tears” T-shirt, taking a sledgehammer to a television set cycling through liberal news shows. The platform’s Twitter account circulates videos of the spokesperson Dana Loesch, a former Breitbart News editor who has said that mainstream journalists are “the rat bastards of the earth” and deserve to be “curb-stomped.” Over menacing images of masked rioters, [she asserts](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-nra-manipulates-gun-owners-and-the-media) that the only way to stop the left is to “fight its violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.” A lawyer and activist called Colion Noir, whose real name is Collins Idehen, Jr., also has a large following. After the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, Noir appeared in a video chiding “all the kids from Parkland getting ready to use your First Amendment to attack everyone else’s Second Amendment.” \n\nLoesch and Noir have become the primary public faces of the N.R.A.; at events, enormous banners feature their images alongside those of LaPierre and Chris Cox, the organization’s top lobbyist. But Loesch and Noir are not technically employed by the N.R.A. Instead, they are paid by Ackerman McQueen, a public-relations firm based in Oklahoma. In at least one year, Loesch earned close to a million dollars, according to a source who has seen her contract.\n\nFor more than three decades, Ackerman has shaped the N.R.A.’s public identity, helping to build it from a niche activist organization into a ubiquitous presence in American popular culture. Ackerman produces the N.R.A. magazine *America’s 1st Freedom* and has devised its most successful ad campaigns, including one called “I’m the N.R.A.,” for which it recruited gun owners, including the actor Tom Selleck and the basketball star Karl Malone, to pose with their weapons. More recently, Ackerman produced a series called “Freedom’s Safest Place,” in which conservative icons inveigh against liberals and terrorists. In a segment from 2016, the country-music star Charlie Daniels warns the “ayatollahs of Iran” that they may be acquainted with “our fresh-faced flower-child President,” but they “haven’t met the heartland—or the people who will defend this nation with their bloody, calloused bare hands.” \n\n\n----------\n\n*This story was published in partnership with [The Trace](https://www.thetrace.org/features/nra-financial-misconduct-ackerman-mcqueen/), a nonprofit news organization covering guns in America.*\n\n\n----------\n\n\n+++\n\nThe N.R.A. and Ackerman have become so intertwined that it is difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins. Top officials and staff move freely between the two organizations; Oliver North, the former Iran-Contra operative, who now serves as the N.R.A.’s president, is paid roughly a million dollars a year through Ackerman, according to two N.R.A. sources. But this relationship, which in many ways has built the contemporary N.R.A., seems also to be largely responsible for the N.R.A.’s dire financial state. According to interviews and to documents that I obtained—federal tax forms, charity records, contracts, corporate filings, and internal communications—a small group of N.R.A. executives, contractors, and venders has extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the nonprofit’s budget, through gratuitous payments, sweetheart deals, and opaque financial arrangements. Memos created by a senior N.R.A. employee describe a workplace distinguished by secrecy, self-dealing, and greed, whose leaders have encouraged disastrous business ventures and questionable partnerships, and have marginalized those who object. “Management has subordinated its judgment to the vendors,” the documents allege. “Trust in the top has eroded.”\n\nIn response to a description of my reporting, Bill Brewer, a lawyer who represents the N.R.A., said that the organization “has serious concerns about the accuracy of this reporting and *The New Yorker*’s sources. Of course, we cannot comment on privileged communications or personnel matters.”\n\nMarc Owens, who served for ten years as the head of the Internal Revenue Service division that oversees tax-exempt enterprises, recently reviewed these records. “The litany of red flags is just extraordinary,” he said. “The materials reflect one of the broadest arrays of likely transgressions that I’ve ever seen. There is a tremendous range of what appears to be the misuse of assets for the benefit of certain venders and people in control.” Owens added, “Those facts, if confirmed, could lead to the revocation of the N.R.A.’s tax-exempt status”—without which the organization could likely not survive.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn its early days, the N.R.A. was more interested in shooting than in politics. It was founded by two former Union Army officers, who returned from the Civil War dismayed at having been outshot by their Confederate counterparts and hoping to inspire a culture of marksmanship in the North. For more than a century, the N.R.A.’s primary concerns were hunting, firearms education, and gun safety. Then, in 1977, a decade after the Federal Gun Control Act restricted firearms sales, activist board members seized control of the group and transformed it into an advocacy organization for gun owners’ rights. Officials knew that this new mission would require a more sophisticated approach to public relations. An N.R.A. executive suggested hiring Ackerman McQueen, which was run by a personal friend. \n\nLater that year, Wayne LaPierre began working for the N.R.A., as a lobbyist. LaPierre, a former Democratic legislative aide with little experience handling guns, was not obviously suited to a role as a firebrand. People who have spent time around him describe him as “mild,” “reserved,” “awkward,” and even “meek.” Still, he rose through the organization, and he built a close relationship with Ackerman. In a deposition concerning a federal-election case, the firm’s then C.E.O., Angus McQueen, said, “I speak to Wayne almost every day. There are exceptions, because I take vacations and he takes vacations. Although he has no reluctance to interrupt mine.” \n\nIn 1991, LaPierre became executive vice-president, the N.R.A.’s top position. He is, by many accounts, reticent about public appearances. According to a story that circulates among staffers, he was once dispatched to appear on a Sunday news show after a school shooting. When a producer entered the greenroom to bring him on set, LaPierre, fretting over talking points, was hiding behind a curtain, with only his wingtips visible. Nonetheless, he appears in videos and makes speeches, often choreographed by Ackerman, that present him as a ferocious critic of the political left. At the N.R.A.’s annual meetings, he disparages “élites” who “long to turn America into some European-style socialist state.” Last year, he told the crowd, “We’re standing at the edge of fear, staring into the abyss of the demise of our country and its freedom we care about most.” He added, “This coming election is a guarantee of our worst nightmares if we don’t win.” A former N.R.A. staffer told me,  “The agency created the Wayne cult of personality.”\n\nEstablished in the early seventies, Ackerman McQueen is a family business. It has about two hundred and twenty-five employees, and offices in Oklahoma City, Dallas, Alexandria, and Colorado Springs. In the past, the company has worked with other national clients, such as the Six Flags amusement parks, but now its roster seems to consist mainly of the N.R.A. and a modest set of regional accounts, including some Oklahoma-based casinos and the Chickasaw Nation. “Most of the agency’s efforts go toward servicing the N.R.A.,” a former senior employee at Ackerman told me. Tax filings for 2017, the most recent year for which records are available, show that the N.R.A. paid Ackerman McQueen and its affiliates more than forty million dollars that year. (Bill Powers, Ackerman’s executive vice-president for public relations, broadly disputed the facts of this article, saying, “It’s like an old Soviet disinformation campaign—you take a little bit of truth and wrap it around a bunch of that things aren’t true.” He declined to point to specific inaccuracies.)\n\nAckerman McQueen provides the N.R.A. with public-relations work, marketing, branding, corporate communications, event planning, Web design, social-media engagement, and digital-content production. It wields great influence over the N.R.A.’s initiatives and is involved with nearly all of the group’s divisions, with the exception of its lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, where, according to former employees, Ackerman’s messaging sometimes undermines the group’s efforts. In 2012, after a gunman murdered twenty children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, LaPierre argued that the best way to prevent such atrocities was to install armed police officers in schools. When President Barack Obama criticized this reasoning, Ackerman responded with an ad noting that Obama’s children received Secret Service protection. An ominous voice-over asked, “Are the President’s kids more important than yours?” At the time, N.R.A. lobbyists were negotiating with federal lawmakers over potential regulations. The organization maintained friendly relations with several Democratic legislators, including Mary Landrieu, a senator from Louisiana. According to a former staffer, the ad caused Landrieu and others to “freak out,” nearly ending those relationships. “Ackerman never cleared that ad with us,” the former staffer recalled. “We had no oversight over Ackerman McQueen.” (Landrieu could not be reached for comment.)\n\nMany N.R.A. employees have long suspected Ackerman of inflating the cost of the services it provides, but its relationships with executives remain strong. For instance, the company has worked closely with LaPierre’s wife, Susan, who maintains an Ackerman e-mail address and was briefly employed there, in the mid-nineties. She now volunteers as a co-chair of the N.R.A.’s Women’s Leadership Forum. Every year, she hosts a luxurious retreat for women who make sizable donations, at which they go on shooting expeditions and mingle with conservative celebrities such as Carly Fiorina and Dick and Liz Cheney. At the N.R.A.’s annual convention, she hosts a W.L.F. lunch and auction. In 2017, she interviewed Trump’s senior adviser Kellyanne Conway onstage, embracing her and calling her “my friend.” Ackerman arranges speakers for these events and provides marketing materials, including glossy brochures that feature photographs of Susan on nearly every page. A former N.R.A. staffer told me that Ackerman “made Susan the face of the W.L.F. project. It pulled Wayne even closer to the firm.” \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn December, 1996, the N.R.A. board’s finance committee gathered at a Hyatt hotel near the Dallas–Fort Worth airport. According to minutes of the meeting, members discussed the fact that “the NRA has been technically insolvent for several years” and “has incurred substantial debt.” The minutes note “improvements in cost containment” but say that the exception was LaPierre, who “directed public relations expenditures, which were significantly over budget ($2,022,900) through the third quarter.” The committee agreed that “in our financial condition the NRA could no longer afford to spend large sums of money on Public Relations . . . nor can it afford to continue [to] allow the EVP to fail to follow the simplest of business procedures—having written agreements with vendors.” \n\nLaPierre promised reforms. As a board member named Weldon Clark recalled, in an affidavit filed with the Federal Election Commission, LaPierre said that he would replace Ackerman with the Mercury Group, a communications firm in Washington, D.C. According to the affidavit, though, an inquiry by board members “revealed that Mercury Group, Inc. was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ackerman McQueen.”\n\nNeal Knox, an influential board member, also urged LaPierre to fire Ackerman, and he agreed. But half a year went by with no apparent action, and Knox warned LaPierre that he planned to have him removed from his post. The following spring, Knox stood for election as an officer, a higher tier of board member. According to the affidavit, Tony Makris, the president of Mercury Group, enlisted the actor Charlton Heston to challenge Knox for the position. Heston, the star of “The Ten Commandments” and “Planet of the Apes,” won by four votes; a year later, he became the N.R.A.’s president. (In the N.R.A.’s version of these events, “In a hotly contested battle, Wayne LaPierre emerged victorious over the dissident board members.”)\n\nAs the relationship between the N.R.A. and Ackerman strengthened, some employees became disgruntled. “Most staffers think that Ackerman is too expensive,” Aaron Davis, who spent a decade working in the N.R.A.’s fund-raising department, told me. “They think they’re just using the N.R.A. to make a massive profit.” Davis, a former special-education teacher from rural South Carolina, started at the N.R.A. in 2005, drawn by the organization’s mission. The staff was underpaid but devoted, with what Davis described as a “rah-rah” attitude. Fund-raising was difficult. Often, Davis told me, potential donors were put off by the N.R.A.’s divisive politics and concerned about what their neighbors would think. He and his colleagues tended to do best with small donors; often, their most successful pitch was persuading people to include donations in their wills. \n\nIn 2010, Tyler Schropp, a former executive at the Mercury Group, was brought in to lead the N.R.A.’s advancement team, a fund-raising group that targets wealthy members. As Schropp reshaped the department, he steered more business toward Ackerman McQueen; Davis recalled that the relationship “skyrocketed.” \n\nSchropp oversaw the production of a magazine, *Ring of Freedom*, which Ackerman had devised to feature wealthy donors. “It was a beautiful magazine,” Davis said. “Rather than do your typical N.R.A. language, which is more hard-hitting, this was meant to tell the stories, the life styles of the donor. So if someone had an airplane, or a collection of Ferraris, we would put that in the magazine.”\n\nN.R.A. employees found the magazines startlingly expensive to produce. “Typically, you’d print around twenty-five hundred copies,” Davis said. “Most of those copies wouldn’t even get used.” At one point, a fund-raising guru came in to give a daylong seminar. “He holds up one of our marketing materials that Ackerman had produced,” Davis said. “He goes, ‘This actually will hurt you. Donors don’t want to see that you’re spending so much money when they give a large gift.’ ”\n\nThe N.R.A.’s tax filings suggest that the advancement team generates only a small portion of revenues, with the “vast majority” of contributions coming instead from “millions of small individual donors.” Still, Schropp’s department spends lavishly; his annual compensation has grown to more than six hundred and twenty thousand dollars. “I was doing fund-raising dinners where wine was pouring freely, and going to dinners with other N.R.A. executives where the bill would be a thousand dollars—just to go out to dinner!” Davis said. He estimated that “at least eighty per cent” of his colleagues brought in less money than they were paid. “I just thought, If the typical N.R.A. member knew that this is how the organization really works, then there’s no way they would give money.” But Davis felt that the culture of the organization discouraged complaints. “If you’re in a war and your commanders are doing something you disagree with, you don’t just go up and question them,” he said. \n\nThe advancement team—roughly thirty staff members—increasingly relied on Ackerman employees. Davis was impressed by their work. “They were topnotch,” he told me. “They did beautiful graphic design, great writing, and we started to lean on them. Over time, we ended up giving almost all of our P.R. projects to Ackerman McQueen.” As the firm’s employees visited the office more frequently, the staff began noticing Lexuses in the parking lot, alongside their own beat-up cars. “I mean, they had a lot going on for them, but they weren’t your folks who were interested in Second Amendment politics,” Davis said. They were “your typical New York or Austin types that are excited about doing really big projects and creative projects. N.R.A. being kind of propaganda gave them the opportunity to do marketing in a way they couldn’t do for any other organization.” He suggested that Ackerman’s approach was impossible to reconcile with the ideals that had drawn him to the N.R.A. “They’re a for-profit organization, trying to do things that would bring more money to them,” he said. “They have completely different intentions than a nonprofit should have, which is for the common good.”\n\nBoard members, particularly those who had served for a long time, grew uncomfortable. Once, Davis recalled, he took a board member to lunch to request a donation: “He just looks at me, and he goes, ‘You know, I like you, but I hate your department.’ I said, ‘Why?’ He says, ‘Because N.R.A. is not fancy Italian shoes with thousand-dollar suits. N.R.A. is the backbone of this country, wearing bluejeans and boots. And your division is taking us to a whole ’nother place.’ ”\n\nIn 2014, Angus McQueen’s son, Revan, got married, in Colorado Springs, in an opulent affair that brought together the most prominent beneficiaries of Ackerman’s work with the N.R.A. Revan had graduated from New York University only five years earlier, but he was being trained to work as the co-C.E.O. of Ackerman McQueen. During the wedding weekend, Revan and his guests, who included Colion Noir and several college classmates, went to a shooting range to practice tactical movements and fire semi-automatic rifles. The ceremony was held at a resort called the Broadmoor, a cluster of Italian Renaissance buildings set on five thousand acres at the foot of Cheyenne Mountain. McQueen sat at a table alongside Tony Makris, of the Mercury Group, and LaPierre. Bill Brewer, the N.R.A. lawyer, who is also McQueen’s son-in-law, sat nearby. The groomsmen, in black tie, toasted one another with twenty-three-year-old Pappy Van Winkle bourbon, which can sell for three thousand dollars a bottle. During the ceremony, the Colorado Springs Philharmonic played on the terrace.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn 2017, visitors to the N.R.A.’s annual meeting, at a convention center in Atlanta, noted a huge banner that ran nearly the full length of the building. It was there to promote a newly launched program called Carry Guard, for members who wanted to protect themselves with firearms. The program offered military-style training, overseen by former Special Forces members, and liability insurance to cover policyholders who had shot people in self-defense. The banner featured an image of Dana Loesch, holding an insurance card and announcing, “I will never carry a gun without carrying this.” On the showroom floor was a Carry Guard virtual-reality exhibit, where participants, equipped with electronic handguns and V.R. goggles, were encouraged to fire away at an armed robber. \n\nAckerman had been deeply involved in developing Carry Guard, and it marketed the insurance aggressively, through e-mail campaigns and an NRATV program called “Carry Guard Daily.” The promotional literature included a guide called “Surviving the Aftermath of a Self-Defense Shooting,” which advised prospective buyers that it was important to “establish for police that you were in fear for your life and did what you felt was necessary.”\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the N.R.A.’s business decisions, Carry Guard was intended to secure the organization’s long-term prosperity. The N.R.A. had spent more than fifty million dollars on the 2016 elections, mostly in support of Donald Trump, and it badly needed revenue. Brian Mittendorf, the chair of the accounting department at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, has analyzed eleven years’ worth of the organization’s public financial statements, starting in 2007\\. In seven of those years, he told me, “the N.R.A. owed more money to others than it had at its discretion to spend.” A financial audit from 2017 revealed that it had nearly reached the limit of a twenty-five-million-dollar line of credit. Additionally, it had been forced to liquidate more than two million dollars from an investment fund, borrow almost four million from its officers’ life-insurance policies, and tap another five million from its affiliated charitable foundation. \n\nCarry Guard inspired controversy from the start. Gun-control activists disparaged it as “murder insurance.” Staff members questioned the value of the program, but, according to the memos I obtained, there was “intimidation of ppl who disagreed.” After the Parkland shooting, in early 2018, the New York State Department of Financial Services advised financial institutions to carefully assess the risks “that may arise from their dealings with the N.R.A. or similar gun promotion organizations.” At the time, the D.F.S. was concluding a long investigation into Carry Guard, which found that the program violated regulations that prevent unlicensed entities from marketing insurance and prohibit insuring a criminal act. In May, 2018, the department said Carry Guard could no longer be sold in the state.\n\nOn May 11th, the N.R.A. sued the D.F.S. and the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, claiming that the department’s actions had caused “tens of millions of dollars in damages.” The group’s lawyers—led by Bill Brewer, McQueen’s son-in-law—framed the dispute as a First Amendment issue, arguing that Cuomo and the D.F.S. had conspired “to deprive the N.R.A. and its constituents” of the “right to speak freely about gun-related issues.” In an amended complaint, the N.R.A. alleged that it had “encountered serious difficulties obtaining corporate insurance coverage, media liability coverage, and basic banking services.” Without such necessities, it said, it would “be unable to exist as a not-for-profit.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nOn the morning of July 30th, the N.R.A.’s audit committee gathered in a windowless conference room at the organization’s headquarters, in Fairfax, Virginia. They were there for an emergency meeting, requested by Brewer. A copy of the day’s agenda notes that the committee discussed “whistleblowing reports.” It also addressed the N.R.A.’s 2017 tax filings, which were due in November. According to two people familiar with the meeting, Emily Cummins, who for twelve years had been the N.R.A.’s managing director of tax and risk management, told the board members that the filings would make unprecedented disclosures about Ackerman McQueen, and briefed them on a series of problematic vender arrangements, each of which had cost the N.R.A. at least a million dollars in the previous year. \n\nCummins declined to comment for the record, but memos that she wrote in the weeks before the meeting give a sense of the issues. One was addressed to Rick Tedrick, the managing director of finance, and titled “List of Top Concerns for Audit Committee.” The memo, written by hand, lists seven areas of primary concern. “N.R.A. pays overbilled, deceptive, vague invoices to ‘preferred’ vendors and contractors,” one entry says. Another notes that “decisions are made in the best interests of vendors,” especially, the memos make clear, those of Ackerman McQueen. A nonprofit’s board is charged with scrutinizing business arrangements and providing fiscal oversight. Yet, according to the memos, the “board hasn’t been told of what’s embarrassing.” \n\nThe 2017 tax filings, prepared at Cummins’s direction, gave the first full accounting of how much the N.R.A. was paying Ackerman McQueen and its affiliates: $40\\.9 million, or about twelve per cent of total expenses that year. Federal regulations require very limited disclosure of how much nonprofit organizations pay their venders, so in previous years the N.R.A.’s filings had not disclosed payments to Ackerman’s affiliates, or any payments that were meant to reimburse expenses. These omissions were probably substantial. The 2017 filing acknowledged a payment of $5.6 million to the Mercury Group, which, despite years of close association with the N.R.A., hadn’t been mentioned in any previous filings.\n\nCummins explained to the board that Ackerman and other venders were generating enormous expenses and getting paid through multiple entities, in a way that obscured payments. One such arrangement involved a company called Membership Marketing Partners, which provides direct-mail fund-raising. In 2017, the N.R.A. paid M.M.P. nearly twelve million dollars. At the same time, it directed almost eight hundred thousand dollars to a firm called Allegiance Creative Group, for “fundraising counsel.” Allegiance doesn’t have a Web site, but, according to state filings, at least ten of its fifteen employees also work at M.M.P. The president and C.E.O. of both companies is Gurney Sloan, who previously worked as a senior vice-president at Ackerman McQueen. This kind of arrangement is not illegal, but, as the former I.R.S. manager Marc Owens told me, “Multiple names for the same entity suggest an effort to disguise the extent of contact. Most organizations have centralized accounting so they can track how much is owed.”\n\nAfter Cummins’s presentation ended, Brewer took over to discuss what the agenda from the meeting refers to as “related party transactions”— arrangements that could improperly enrich N.R.A. leaders or their associates. Before he spoke, most of the staff members were asked to leave the room. But the memos suggest some of the concerns. They assert that about a quarter of the organization’s staff is “now managed by former employees” of Ackerman who have been hired by the N.R.A., creating “financial conflicts of interest.” As an example, the documents note $2\\.6 million paid to a corporate entity called Under Wild Skies, whose annual reports list Tony Makris as president, the same position he holds with the Mercury Group. “Under Wild Skies” is also the name of a TV show, broadcast on the Outdoor Channel, that features Makris and his guests, including Revan McQueen, tracking big game in such far-flung locales as Botswana’s Okavango Delta. (“Under Wild Skies” used to appear on mainstream TV, but NBC Sports ended its run after Makris, on camera, shot an elephant in the face.) According to a recent article in the *Times*, the N.R.A. has paid Under Wild Skies some eighteen million dollars since 2010\\. Until recently, Tyler Schropp, who runs the N.R.A.’s advancement team, the large-donor program, also served as the treasurer of Under Wild Skies. Brewer, the lawyer, told the *Times* that Schropp had “a minuscule interest” in the company, and that he had relinquished his stake. But N.R.A. officials were evidently concerned; in documents filed soon after the audit committee met in July, Schropp’s name was listed among the officers of Under Wild Skies, but had been crossed out by hand. \n\nOne of the memos alleges that “protecting the N.R.A. now means protecting and enriching the officers and Tyler”—a reference to Schropp. His advancement team, despite having dozens of full-time staff members, has paid consultants millions of dollars for “identifying prospective high net worth individuals” and “providing advice and support.” \n\nOne of these venders is Wayne Sheets, who retired from the N.R.A. in 2008 but continued to serve as a fund-raising consultant. According to state filings, Sheets’s contract stipulated a “base monthly consulting fee” of thirty thousand dollars, to be paid “regardless of the number of consulting hours provided by Consultant.” Federal tax records show that, in 2017, the N.R.A. paid Sheets seven hundred and ten thousand dollars. The memos note that he received an additional two hundred and forty thousand dollars in “expense reimbursements.” Cummins wrote that Sheets’s case was “just one illustration” of N.R.A. staff “being told to process payments w/o documentation.” His contract was recently extended through 2023\\. \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe memos frequently note a lack of transparency around questionable payments to individuals. Mike Marcellin worked at the N.R.A. for almost twenty-three years. As a senior employee, he oversaw the organization’s relationship with Lockton Affinity, an insurance administrator that worked on Carry Guard and other N.R.A.-branded insurance products. In 2016, Marcellin retired from the N.R.A. and started a private consultancy. Although he had worked only the first few weeks of January, the organization paid him a full year’s salary—nearly six hundred and thirty thousand dollars, according to tax filings, mostly in the form of a bonus. During the same year, the memos reveal, Lockton paid him about four hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The memos assert that “no one was aware” that Marcellin was receiving income from both organizations—a situation that should have been disclosed on the N.R.A.’s 2016 tax filings. (The payment from Lockton was mentioned on the following year’s filing, with a note that it had been “inadvertently excluded” in 2016\\.) \n\nState records reveal several arrangements that Marc Owens described as “extraordinary.” One involves LaPierre. The records say that his contract “provides for consulting services and personal appearances upon the end of his employment, at an annual rate that starts at his currently contracted final base salary and is later reduced.” LaPierre earns more than a million dollars a year. “I’ve never seen anything like that before,” Owens said. \n\nAnother deal involves Kyle Weaver, the N.R.A.’s former executive director of general operations, who was fired in the fall of 2016\\. That year, he had been paid seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars. According to state filings, he received a hundred and fifty thousand dollars upon his exit, continued to be paid through 2018, and received “a final lump sum” this past January.\n\nWeaver was replaced by Josh Powell, an outdoorsman in his mid-forties. Powell came to the N.R.A. after running two clothing catalogues that catered to men who enjoy adventure, venison, and fine wine. Businesses that had worked with Powell sued him on at least twenty occasions, for unpaid bills amounting to more than four hundred thousand dollars. \n\nPowell has a close relationship with Makris, dating back to at least 2011\\. That year, the two men travelled together to Patagonia, for a photo shoot for one of Powell’s catalogues, in which they are pictured smoking cigars and gazing at the sunset. The accompanying text describes an idyllic two-week fishing and hunting trip: “Bags of Cubans, bottles of Scotch, enough red meat to appease any man, and certainly enough fresh air to make you wonder why you settle for the norm to begin with.” \n\nA recent article in the *Wall Street Journal* revealed that, in late 2017, Powell’s wife, Colleen Gallagher, took a job with one of the N.R.A.’s top fund-raising venders, McKenna & Associates, as a “senior advisor.” Powell told the *Journal* that his wife “works on some N.R.A. business,” and that he had disclosed her employment to the audit committee. But Cummins’s memo to the committee, written half a year after Gallagher was hired, suggests that the board had not been informed. The first item on the page reads, “Josh Powell’s financial conflicts of interest: wife paid by top vendor.” (In a statement, Andrew Arulanandam, an N.R.A. spokesperson, said, “The NRA has a conflict of interest policy, and arrangements are evaluated to ensure they work in the best interest of the organization.”)\n\nNot long after Powell started at the N.R.A., his father began photographing shooting competitions for its publications. In addition, Powell tried to arrange a job at the N.R.A. for a woman with whom he’d had a sexual relationship. Powell admitted to the relationship when he was deposed by a lawyer representing one of his unpaid venders. Ultimately, the woman was not hired.\n\nAccording to filings, the N.R.A. paid Powell nearly eight hundred thousand dollars in 2017\\. In December, 2018, he was moved out of the job of executive director of general operations. According to a company-wide e-mail, he was given a “promotion” to the N.R.A.’s legal team, which he assists as a “senior strategist.” Powell is not an attorney.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nLast August, the N.R.A., in desperate need of funds, raised its dues for the second time in two years. To cut costs, it has eliminated free coffee and water coolers at its headquarters and has frozen its employees’ pension plan. Carry Guard, which was meant to save the organization, has proved disastrous. According to the memos, in 2017, the year that Carry Guard was introduced, Ackerman McQueen received some six million dollars for its work on the product, which included the creation of a Web site and media productions featuring celebrity firearms trainers. The lawsuit against New York State has created an additional burden. Sources familiar with the N.R.A.’s financial commitments say that it is paying Brewer’s firm an average of a million and a half dollars a month. \n\nAn official assessment performed by Cummins last summer dryly describes the N.R.A.’s decision-making during the previous year as “management’s shift in risk appetite.” The document analyzes the organization’s executive-liability exposures and discusses insurance policies that “protect NRA directors and officers from claims by third parties that they have breached their duties, such as by mismanagement of association assets.” From 2018 to 2019, it says, insurance costs increased by three hundred and forty-one per cent. “To say this is a major increase would be an understatement,” Peter Kochenburger, the deputy director of the Insurance Law Center at the University of Connecticut, told me. “This seems to be pretty direct evidence that the N.R.A.’s problems are not due to New York but rather to how the organization conducts itself.”\n\nThe memos urged the audit committee to “step up + fulfill its duties!,” but it’s not clear what the board has done to root out malfeasance. James Fishman, a co-author of “New York Nonprofit Law and Practice: With Tax Analysis,” a leading text on nonprofit law, told me, “There is no such thing as a director who doesn’t direct. You’re responsible to make yourself aware of what’s going on. If the board doesn’t know, they’ve breached their duty of care, which is against the law in New York,” where the N.R.A. is chartered. According to Owens, the former I.R.S. official, New York State “could sanction board members, remove board members, disband the board, or close down the organization entirely.” \n\nSince the emergency meeting in July, sources familiar with the board’s decisions say, the audit committee has retroactively signed off on at least some of the N.R.A.’s problematic transactions. “That does legitimize them,” Owens said, “but a regulator would want to know why the process was unfolding this way, especially if it’s part of a larger pattern.” Last fall, the N.R.A. made its 2017 tax filings public, revealing its payments to Ackerman McQueen and its affiliates. I asked the N.R.A., at the time, why it had made these disclosures, and a spokesperson told me that it was “in an effort to offer greater visibility into the dealings of the Association and foundation.” On April 12th, the N.R.A. embarked on another lawsuit—against Ackerman McQueen. The suit alleges that Ackerman has denied the N.R.A. access to basic business records, including the terms of Oliver North’s contract, and blames the firm for throwing it into an existential crisis. Ackerman’s general lack of transparency, the complaint says, “threatens to imminently and irreparably harm” the N.R.A.’s status as a nonprofit organization. (In response, the marketing firm issued a statement saying it “has served the NRA and its members with great pride and dedication for the last 38 years. The NRA’s action is frivolous, inaccurate and intended to cause harm to the reputation of our company and the future of that 38-year relationship.”)\n\nBut the N.R.A.’s leaders also remain focussed on threats from outside. On March 2nd, LaPierre delivered his annual speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. He told the crowd, “In real time right before your very eyes, we, the National Rifle Association, on behalf of all Americans, are fighting perhaps the most important piece of First Amendment constitutional advocacy in the history of our country.” The suit against New York State, he said, “will decide whether or not government can be weaponized against you if your opinion differs from theirs.” The N.R.A. now has a Web page devoted to soliciting donations to support the suit. “Please give as generously as you can,” the text urges, “and help win this life-or-death legal battle for the survival of the N.R.A. and freedom.”\n\n*This piece has been updated to include a response from Ackerman McQueen and to correct a misspelling of the board member Neal Knox’s name.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1da341c92e2c9b85db63","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"N.R.A.","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"nra"},{"id":"5c2e1eb8b75f002c8941e678","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Wayne LaPierre","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"wayne-lapierre"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a6656c4c222f03a82d63","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/mike-spies","email":"","name":"Mike Spies","socialMedia":[],"title":"Mike Spies is a staff writer at The Trace and a 2017 Livingston Awards finalist."}]},"dek":"The organization’s leadership is focussed on external threats, but the real crisis may be internal.","hed":"Secrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2019-04-19T18:55:00.639Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5cb5f9ebfc1f8c3868bc2389","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"2:1":{"width":1836,"height":918,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":310,"y":125,"height":918,"width":1836}},"duration":null},"2:2":{"width":1044,"height":1044,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":694,"y":137,"height":1044,"width":1044}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":2400,"height":1350,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":1350,"width":2400}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":2083,"height":1562,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":158,"y":0,"height":1562,"width":2083}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":2400,"height":2400,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":2400,"width":2400,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2019/04/16/5cb5f9ebfc1f8c3868bc2388_Spies-nra.jpg","width":2400,"height":2400,"duration":null}},"altText":"Eagle flying over guns dropping money","credit":"Illustration by Ben Wiseman","filename":"Spies-nra.jpg","revision":1,"tags":[],"title":"","variants":{}}]},"promoDek":"The organization’s leadership is focussed on external threats, but the real crisis may be internal.","promoHed":"Secrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.","pubDate":"2019-04-17T23:10:00.000Z","related":[],"rubric":"","seoDescription":"Mike Spies reports on internal memos from the N.R.A. detailing the organization’s relationship with the public-relations firm Ackerman McQueen.","seoTitle":"Secrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.","socialDescription":"The organization’s leadership is focussed on external threats, but the real crisis may be internal.","socialTitle":"Secrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.","subChannel":"News Desk","tags":["N.R.A.","Wayne LaPierre"],"template":"standard","url":"/news/news-desk/secrecy-self-dealing-and-greed-at-the-nra","videos":{}},{"id":"5cccce213e22812e9dda3feb","modelName":"article","collection":"articles","body":"-=-=-=-\n\nIn July of 2018, as the National Rifle Association was in the throes of a financial crisis, a half-dozen of the organization’s accountants produced a document detailing what they believed to be the most egregious issues that needed to be addressed by its audit committee—a small group of N.R.A. board members tasked with conducting fiscal oversight. \n\nThe accountants’ one-and-a-half-page memo, titled “List of Top Concerns for the Audit Committee,” details a range of questionable transactions and business arrangements involving several top N.R.A. venders and executives. It offers new details on the financial mismanagement occurring inside the organization, which had been laid out in an earlier, handwritten memo, dated to July 12th and compiled by Emily Cummins, who was then the N.R.A.’s managing director of tax and risk management. \n\nLast month, The Trace and *The New Yorker* [reported](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/secrecy-self-dealing-and-greed-at-the-nra) on the July 12th memo’s damaging contents, along with a broad array of other revelations culled from public and internal records. Since then, Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, where the N.R.A. is chartered, has opened an investigation into the organization’s tax-exempt status.\n\nAs the depths of the gun group’s fiscal problems have become public, its leadership has attempted to blame Democratic politicians and overzealous regulators for throwing it into a dire financial state. Last month, the N.R.A. also blamed Ackerman McQueen, a public-relations firm that, for almost four decades, has meticulously crafted the organization’s identity and  placed the N.R.A. at the vanguard of the culture wars. The N.R.A. filed a lawsuit accusing Ackerman—historically the gun group’s most expensive vender—of engaging in deceptive business practices. (Ackerman has disputed the lawsuit’s allegations, contending that it was transparent in providing the N.R.A. with “every single piece of information” that the organization requested.)\n\n----------\n\n*This story was published in partnership with [The Trace](https://www.thetrace.org/2019/05/nra-accountants-memo-unexplained-spending/), a nonprofit news organization covering guns in America.*\n\n\n----------\n\n\nThe N.R.A.’s relationship with Ackerman seems to be the most prominent example of an organizational culture that is marked by secrecy, self-dealing, and greed, and has cost the N.R.A. hundreds of millions of dollars through bloated payments, lavish deals, and opaque financial arrangements. The memo to the audit committee appears to show that the N.R.A.’s troubles stretch beyond its dealings with Ackerman. It suggests new examples of unexplained spending, weak oversight, mismanagement, and conflicts of interest among members of the N.R.A.’s senior management. \n\n“As previously stated, the N.R.A. has serious concerns about the accuracy of this reporting and *The New Yorker’s* sources,” William A. Brewer III, a lawyer who represents the N.R.A., wrote. “Of course, we cannot comment on privileged communications or personnel matters—especially in response to out-of-context assertions.” He added, “This ‘report’ is obsolete and misleading. The N.R.A. has a conflict-of-interest policy, and the audit committee reviews all related-party transactions, when appropriate.” The organization, he said, “strives to comply with all applicable regulations.”\n\nOne of the senior N.R.A. executives mentioned in the audit-committee memo is Woody Phillips, who served as the organization’s treasurer and chief financial officer for twenty-six years before retiring, in 2018\\. The document states, without explanation, that the N.R.A. had made “payments” to Phillips’s “significant other.” Brewer challenged the accuracy of the assertion. “Payments were not made to any ‘significant other’ of the N.R.A.’s former C.F.O.,” Brewer wrote. “The N.R.A. hired an I.T. consulting firm with links to a social friend of Mr. Phillips. That firm was interviewed and vetted by the N.R.\nA.’s I.T. department, and its engagement was reviewed and approved by the audit committee.”\n\nThe accountants described invoices submitted by several venders and paid by the N.R.A. as “vague and deceptive.” One questionable arrangement involved Associated Television International, a television-production company. From 1998 to 2014, A.T.I. produced a crime-reënactment show called “Crime Strike,” which featured the N.R.A.’s executive vice-president and C.E.O., Wayne LaPierre. According to the accountants, the N.R.A. paid A.T.I. “$1\\.8M for rental of a house” belonging to David McKenzie, A.T.I.’s president. The accountants do not say who rented the home, why the N.R.A. covered the rental at such an enormous cost, nor what, if anything, was “deceptive” about the bill. \n\nMichael Donaldson, A.T.I.’s outside counsel, confirmed that the company sent the N.R.A. “seven invoices” concerning the house, which added up to “almost $1\\.8 million.” He went on, “The invoices in question were all for refurbishing episodes after completion of the original episodes of ‘Crime Strike,’ ” adding, “the invoiced amounts include not only the house but also various production-related items such as lights, props, and some crew.” Donaldson told me that A.T.I. has “stopped rendering services for the N.R.A. for some time.” “In fact,” he said, “they are now focussed on working on an independent documentary called ‘Inside the N.R.A.’ ”\n\nBrewer, the lawyer representing the N.R.A., said that the audit committee is “addressing those issues” and that the N.R.A.’s “long relationship with A.T.I.” has “resulted in significant benefits for the Association and its members.” Brewer added, “As is true of all such relationships, it is a subject of ongoing review by the N.R.A.”\n\nOther payments questioned in the memo involved Membership Marketing Partners, a fund-raising contractor. In 2017, the N.R.A. paid  the firm nearly twelve million dollars. The Trace and *The New Yorker* previously reported that, in the same year, the N.R.A. paid almost eight hundred thousand dollars for “fundraising counsel” to a firm called Allegiance Creative Group. According to North Carolina state filings, at least ten of Allegiance’s fifteen employees and executives also work at Membership Marketing Partners; one such executive is Gurney Sloan, who serves as the president and C.E.O. of both companies. According to the accounting memo, “MMP bills violate contract stipulations,” though it does not specify which stipulations. \n\nIn addition, the memo drew attention to “senior management override of internal controls,” which led to violations of “accounts payable procedures” and “HR policy,”  including “hiring of staff without HR knowledge.” It names four executives who, at the time, were receiving “reimbursement of expenses relating to apartments and living expenses beyond HR Policy Manual stipulations and on a permanent basis.” The N.R.A.’s accountants added that there was “no contract to support the reimbursement request,” which the four individuals continued to claim as a “relocation expense.” The executives named include Doug Hamlin, the N.R.A.’s executive director of publications; Eric Frohardt, the director of education and training; Joe DeBergalis, the executive director of general operations; and Josh Powell, LaPierre’s chief of staff. \n\nAndrew Arulanandam, the N.R.A.’s managing director of public affairs, said that the organization “has, at times, made such accommodations for employees who travel extensively for their jobs.” He added, “The practice of providing such accommodations is approved by N.R.A. leadership and is not uncommon for an organization the size of the N.R.A.”\n\nJames Fishman, an expert on nonprofit law and a co-author of “New York Nonprofit Law and Practice: With Tax Analysis,” said that the housing payments, along with the other arrangements described in the memo, suggested “that senior people at the N.R.A. are using the organization for their own private benefit.” He said, “That is against the law. The nonprofit is supposed to serve a public purpose, not a private purpose.”\n\nThe N.R.A. hired Powell in 2016, after he ran two high-end clothing catalogues that catered to wealthy outdoorsmen. Businesses that had worked with Powell [sued him](https://www.thetrace.org/2018/10/nra-josh-powell/) on at least twenty occasions, alleging unpaid bills totalling more than four hundred thousand dollars. Powell served as the N.R.A.’s executive director of general operations for roughly two years, until this past December. The organization’s 2017 tax filings revealed that Powell had racked up more than a hundred thousand dollars in personal expenses—including a housing allowance—paid by the N.R.A. In December, 2018, Powell, who is not an attorney, was promoted to “senior strategist” on the N.R.A. legal team that sued Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York Department of Financial Services that spring. \n\nThe memo to the audit committee cites Powell’s multiple conflicts of interest, including N.R.A. payments to his father, a photographer, and the fact that, in late 2017, his wife, Colleen Gallagher, was hired by one of the N.R.A.’s top fund-raising venders, McKenna & Associates. \n\nArulanandam, the N.R.A. spokesperson, said that the audit committee was “aware of the relationship and approved the consulting arrangement with McKenna.” The company, he said, “has for years been a trusted advisor to the association in the area of business consulting, development, and strategic planning.” Toby Merchant, a lawyer representing McKenna, told me that Gallagher was “actively recruited by McKenna” and that she was “hired on the merits of her skills and talents.”\n\nThe memo alleges that McKenna provided “vague project names,” failed to “attach support” for invoices, and operated with “no contract for current work.” Brewer, the N.R.A. lawyer, said there was nothing unusual about shrouding work in secrecy: “As is customary in finance, consulting, and other industries, N.R.A. vendors have occasionally used code names for transactions or projects. This does not mean the N.R.A. lacked knowledge regarding the services rendered. For example, work performed by McKenna & Associates was reviewed, vetted, and approved.” \n\nMerchant, McKenna’s attorney, said that “Senior leadership and the audit committee were well aware of the services and deliverables being provided by McKenna & Associates.” He added that the N.R.A.’s “accounting department” would “not have had access to the confidential details of the McKenna & Associates engagement.” He said that McKenna’s work for the N.R.A. was neither ‘vague’ nor ‘unsupported.’” Any assertion to the contrary, he asserted, “is demonstrably false.” \n\nThough it’s not mentioned in the memo, around the time that Powell became LaPierre’s chief of staff, the organization brought in Dan Winders, the chief operating officer of one of Powell’s catalogues. Winders told me, in a text message, that the N.R.A. had given him a “one-day consultation with their promotional-products team to evaluate their business processes and inventory management.” \n\nThe N.R.A.’s accountants completed their memo in mid-July. Around this period, the N.R.A.’s new C.F.O., Craig Spray, had to temporarily step away from his role at the organization to deal with a health matter. Someone would need to take his place as the organization’s chief manager of financial activities. According to an internal N.R.A. communication, in July, 2018, Powell was appointed acting C.F.O. for about three weeks, placing him in charge of the accountants who documented his conflicts of interest.\n\n“This is norm-breaking across the lines—deeply problematic and definitely not best practices,” Philip Hackney, who worked for five years as an attorney in the Internal Revenue Service’s chief counsel’s office, said. “If all of these allegations are true, you’re talking about nonprofit governance gone bad, with choices resulting in possible theft, which is not in anyone’s interest.”\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b2396212cbb9fc997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guns","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guns"},{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274660","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"National Rifle Association","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"national-rifle-association"},{"id":"5c2e1eb8b75f002c8941e678","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Wayne LaPierre","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"wayne-lapierre"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c2710c62d10815412","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Business","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"business"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a6656c4c222f03a82d63","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/mike-spies","email":"","name":"Mike Spies","socialMedia":[],"title":"Mike Spies is a staff writer at The Trace and a 2017 Livingston Awards finalist."}]},"dek":"","hed":"An Internal Memo Raises New Questions About Self-Dealing at the N.R.A.","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2019-05-08T18:54:47.893Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5cd090ec7bf70b38e5de744e","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"2:1":{"width":2559,"height":1279,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":573,"height":1279,"width":2559}},"duration":null},"2:2":{"width":1160,"height":1160,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":699,"y":692,"height":1160,"width":1160}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":2031,"height":1142,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":264,"y":710,"height":1142,"width":2031}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":2239,"height":1679,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":160,"y":171,"height":1679,"width":2239}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":1658,"height":1658,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":450,"y":194,"height":1658,"width":1658}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2019/05/06/5cd090ec7bf70b38e5de744d_Spies-NRAFollowUp.jpg","width":2560,"height":1853,"duration":null}},"caption":"An internal memo from 2018 suggests new examples of unexplained spending, weak oversight, mismanagement, and conflicts of interest among the N.R.A.’s senior management.

Officials at the Department of Homeland Security began holding a series of briefings to educate Kushner on current policies, and a small staff was detailed from the federal bureaucracy to advise him on specifics. One person with knowledge of the meetings told me that Kushner “didn’t seem to know anything” about the legal and political challenges of comprehensive immigration reform, which has eluded Presidents for close to three decades. The prevailing wisdom on Capitol Hill has been that reform is only possible in pieces—for instance, aggressive border security (a priority for Republicans) could be paired with a legalization program for Dreamers (a priority for Democrats). Yet, during the past two years, even incrementalist dealmaking has failed, as the President has walked away from one bipartisan agreement after another. Kushner, who once told reporters that he didn’t come to Washington to work on immigration policy, agreed to take a break from his work on the [Middle East peace process](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/22/the-trump-netanyahu-alliance) to fill the void at home. \n\nThis past week, when Kushner met with Senate Republicans to unveil the broad strokes of his proposal, an Administration official told the Washington *Post* that the purpose of the presentation was to generate a “political document” that congressional Republicans could “rally behind.” At the meeting, however, Kushner struggled to answer even the most basic questions—about the fate of the [Dreamers](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/dreamers), for example—and confused a number of senators with vague, sometimes contradictory language. The thrust of the plan, in theory, was to revamp the country’s legal-immigration system by redistributing annual visas to immigrants based on their employment skills rather than on their family ties. But, at one point, Kushner vowed that the reform would help “unify families.” Moderate Republicans were put off by the plan’s haziness, and influential members of the restrictionist wing of the Party felt that Kushner hadn’t gone far enough to retool legal immigration. (The plan, which no one actually saw, was said to include additional funds for a border wall, along with measures to restrict asylum and increase family detention.) An Administration official who had worked on Trump’s Presidential campaign told me that Kushner was a “lefty squish from New York.” \n\nOn Thursday, despite the failure of Kushner’s proposal to gain traction with members of the President’s own party, Trump announced that it was the basis of his new immigration policy. Those expecting the White House to offer specifics of an actual plan were either disappointed or relieved: by the end of the day, no further information was released beyond what the President described in broad generalities in a speech delivered in the Rose Garden. At times, it sounded as though substantive proposals were not yet drafted, and the President made reference to portions that were still being conceived and written. According to Trump, the aim of the over-all plan was both to “stop illegal immigration and fully secure the border” and to overhaul the legal-immigration system to “attract the best and brightest from all around the world.” \n\nA million people receive visas in the U.S. each year; twelve per cent of them currently qualify based on their skills (such as language proficiency and level of education), and more than half do so because of existing family relationships. (A spouse or parent, say, already has legal status.) The White House wants to flip the distribution, without lowering the over-all number of visas granted annually. The policy debate over how the U.S. confers legal status on immigrants—whether the country should stick to its family-based model or move to something more “merit-based”—is fraught. The visa system, which has failed to keep pace with changes in the U.S. and global economy, hasn’t been meaningfully changed since 1990. The reason for that is mostly political, and the Trump Administration has done nothing in the past two years to inspire confidence that it might have an answer. \n\nMeanwhile, the asylum crisis at the southern border, which both parties recognize as urgent, has nothing to do with a merit-based legal-immigration system. The President’s speech on Thursday had a familiar structure, in which the first, and more passionate, half consisted of his usual litany about MS-13, immigrant crime, and “open borders.” By the time Trump got to the legal-immigration component, at the end, he looked bored. \n\nA few hours before the President’s speech at the White House, I asked a former Republican aide with years of experience on immigration issues in Congress what the political rationale could be for introducing a plan that only seemed to reveal the current disarray of the Republican caucus. “One hundred per cent hubris,” the former aide said, adding that Kushner and Trump “think that the rest of us are idiots, that we don’t understand the art of the deal.” In 2007, in a previous comprehensive immigration-reform effort, Republicans advanced a proposal to modify the legal-immigration system by introducing a points system for determining who was eligible to receive visas. “It didn’t work because it was too fucking complicated!” the aide told me. Trump had already failed multiple times in the past two years to negotiate much more limited immigration proposals. “They were close to a deal on a lot of this stuff”—a *DACA*{:.small} fix, for one—“and the President walked away because [Stephen Miller](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-stephen-miller-single-handedly-got-the-us-to-accept-fewer-refugees) convinced him he could do better.” When I asked the aide if Republican congressmen might even resent the President’s latest gambit, the aide replied, “I think to really annoy them, they would have had to take this whole Kushner proposal seriously.”\n\nIn the Senate, the Democrats have just reintroduced an immigration proposal of their own, which was tailored more narrowly to the current crisis at the border. It had four broad components: increasing aid to Central America; creating additional ways for asylum seekers to seek relief without having to make the dangerous overland trip to the border; addressing the backlog of asylum cases in immigration courts; and toughening penalties for child smugglers on both sides of the border. The proposals are commonsensical and technocratic, and the first two would, in some fashion, reinstate policies that the Trump Administration has tried to end. \n\nEarlier this week, Senate Minority Leader [Chuck Schumer](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/chuck-schumer) told journalists at the Capitol about a conversation he’d recently had with the President, who had apparently called him to ask what they could agree to do on immigration. “I said, ‘Mr. President, look at comprehensive immigration reform,’ and I sent him the bill,” Schumer said, in reference to legislation from 2013 that passed the Senate but died in the House, where the Republican Speaker, John Boehner, refused to bring it to a floor vote. The 2013 bill addressed everything from border security and legalization of undocumented immigrants to changes in the legal-immigration system. It also proposed a shift toward a merit-based system and the elimination of certain categories of family-based migration. These changes were palatable to Democrats because other measures were included as inducements. Kushner’s proposal, by comparison, was both less coherent and much less ambitious. \n\nOne thing Thursday’s announcement made clear was how difficult, if not impossible, it has become to get back to the terms of the 2013 bill and the hard-fought consensus it represented. Sitting in the front row on the White House lawn as Trump gave his address was Senator [Lindsey Graham](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/lindsey-graham), Republican of South Carolina, who helped write the comprehensive immigration-reform bill in 2013. He was also an architect of a bipartisan plan crafted in February, 2018, to protect Dreamers from deportation after the President had cancelled *DACA*{:.small} the previous year. (Trump rejected that deal on the spot when Graham brought it to the White House.) On Thursday, Trump called out to Graham from the dais to thank him for his support. Now one of Trump’s most ardent defenders, Graham is working on a bill to change the asylum process at the border. He hasn’t finished drafting the actual bill, but this week, on the floor of the Senate, he proposed a system in which Central Americans are not allowed to seek asylum at the U.S. border at all. It’s an obvious breach of national and international law—in other words, exactly what the President wants. “We need something very quickly, and if you can get it done, that would be fantastic,” Trump said. Graham flashed him the thumbs-up.

Cissna, the director of Citizenship and Immigration Services (U.S.C.I.S.), announced that he was changing the agency’s mission statement. It would no longer make reference to “America’s promise as a nation of immigrants,” Cissna said. Instead, it would emphasize the agency’s charge to preserve “the nation’s lawful immigration system.” U.S.C.I.S., which is generally overshadowed by *ICE*{:.small} and Border Patrol, its counterpart agencies at the Department of Homeland Security, processes applications for visas, citizenship, legal residency, and asylum, and has authority over a vast network of regulations and federal rules that affect the lives of tens of millions of immigrants in the United States. Cissna has been the head of U.S.C.I.S for nearly two years, and during that time he has reshaped the legal immigration system in ways that are often too technical to capture mainstream attention: he has created a denaturalization task force to strip people of their citizenship, restricted work authorizations, blocked paths for immigrants to obtain legal status, and imposed [rules to penalize](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/trumps-public-charge-rule-is-a-one-two-punch-against-immigrants-and-public-assistance) immigrants for their use of public services. He has also been a vocal critic of the country’s family-based legal-immigration system, which he, like the President, has long wanted to overhaul. A profile in [Politico](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/09/20/uscis-director-lee-francis-cissna-profile-220141) called Cissna “the man behind Trump’s invisible wall.” \n\nOne thing Cissna has always made clear is that his actions are a matter of law, not ideology. The distinction has been a point of pride for him. “Cissna is an immigration nerd,” one of his former U.S.C.I.S. colleagues told me. Any time Cissna testifies in front of Congress or leads internal agency meetings, he carries a soft-bound volume of the Immigration and Naturalization Act—as if he were the embodiment of the by-the-book bureaucrat. The appearance of such fastidiousness is part of his power; his policy positions, however extreme, are shrouded in legal rationales. His denaturalization task force, for instance, was about “denaturalizing people who should not have been naturalized in the first place,” he said. “We finally have a process in place to get to the bottom of all these bad cases.” Family separation at the border came down to the fact that there needed to be “consequences” when someone crossed the border illegally. “I just feel a strong commitment to the law, and to the rule of law,” he said. “None of the things we’re doing . . . are guided by any kind of malevolent intent.” \n\nThe Trump Administration has enacted the harshest immigration policies in a century, but it has also reached the outer limits of what any government can legally do to stem immigration. The courts have blocked a number of the President’s signature initiatives, from his family-separation policy to a Presidential proclamation banning asylum. In response, the Administration has planned more aggressive enforcement measures, but none of them has changed regional migration flows. Last month, nearly a hundred thousand Central Americans were apprehended at the southern border, and the number of families seeking asylum has reached the highest level in at least a decade. [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) has since vowed to [cut all aid](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-cycle-of-self-sabotage-at-the-us-border) to the region, which will only worsen the conditions on the ground in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. And, at the instigation of his senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, he has begun to purge the upper echelons of D.H.S. Last week, Trump [fired](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/kirstjen-nielsens-inevitable-resignation-from-the-department-of-homeland-security) his Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, and was also preparing to oust Cissna, who has repeatedly clashed with Miller. \n\nThe main sources of contention in the Trump White House are the laws and regulations that dictate how the government must treat asylum seekers at the border. By law, migrants are given an initial screening, known as a credible-fear interview, to determine whether they are in danger in their home countries; if they pass, which a majority of asylum seekers do, border authorities allow them into the country pending a full hearing before an immigration judge. At one D.H.S. meeting last year, Miller accused department officials of sympathizing with asylum seekers, because so many migrants were passing these screenings. “You need to tighten up,” he said, according to the [*Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/us/politics/trump-immigration-stephen-miller.html). Cissna told Miller to “stand down.”\n\nA D.H.S. official told me, “Credible-fear hearings are the potential choke point. Most people make it through that initial round, and U.S.C.I.S. does not choke them off there.” The official added, “The credible-fear interview is the ‘asylum loophole.’&nbsp;” Closing it, however, would require changes to asylum law, and the Trump Administration is unwilling to go to Congress. Instead, the White House has directed the department to take radical action and deal with the consequences later. In the general counsel’s office at D.H.S., the official told me, “there’s a view now that we should be pushing the legal limits,” because “we’re going to win at the Supreme Court.” \n\nLate last week, I spoke to one Administration official who had worked on the President’s 2016 campaign and continued to describe himself as a committed Trumpist. “There’s just been an atmosphere where people are not trying to implement the President’s agenda,” he told me. “A court would say, ‘You’re enjoined’&nbsp;”—legally required to stop—“and that would be the end of the discussion from the lawyers, almost like they were relieved they didn’t have to deal with it anymore.” Cissna, the official told me, “wasn’t moving fast enough, the regulations weren’t moving fast enough.” It wasn’t clear what this meant, exactly, short of Cissna rewriting asylum law in contravention of Congress. When I asked a former White House official whether such criticisms of Cissna were fair, the former official replied, “He acts like an establishment bean counter,” adding that “he is not big-think enough.” \n\nOn Tuesday, the Attorney General, William Barr, issued an order that could force tens of thousands of asylum seekers to remain in jail indefinitely while they wait for an immigration judge to rule on their claims. There is a current backlog of approximately a million cases in the country’s immigration courts, and it can take several months, if not years, for asylum seekers to get a full hearing before a judge. Trump wants his Administration to detain as many asylum seekers as it can, rather than release them with a future court date. Barr’s order relies on an [obscure authority](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/jeff-sessions-is-out-but-his-dark-vision-for-immigration-policy-lives-on) to refer immigration cases to himself for review, but it will not affect unaccompanied children or families, who remain exempt because of existing legal protections, even though they currently make up more than half of all asylum seekers at the border. “This decision might actually be the most Barr can do related to the President’s immediate concerns at the southern border,” Sarah Pierce, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told me. “The President wants to be able to deport unaccompanied children and detain families. His inability to do either of these things is so well spelled-out in statute and litigation that I cannot imagine a way for the Administration to get around those using referral and review.” \n\nCissna, for the time being, has retained his post. Influential anti-immigration groups protested his potential firing, and Republican hard-liners in Congress came to his defense. Chuck Grassley, who once worked with Cissna on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that the President was “pulling the rug out from the very people that are trying to help him accomplish his goal.” Cissna’s immediate boss, the new acting head of D.H.S., Kevin McAleenan, is widely seen as a relative moderate with solid credentials. He replaced Nielsen because she did not have a deputy to assume the position in her absence, but, as the official who worked on Trump’s campaign told me, “It’s well known that McAleenan is an anti-Trumper.” \n\nAmid the staffing shakeup last week, D.H.S. officials scrambled to make preparations for a new set of rules requested by the White House, concerning immigrants who overstay their visas after entering the United States. Countries with high rates of immigrant overstays, as they’re known, would be penalized; the U.S. government would restrict visas to their citizens unless the overstay numbers declined. Then the plans were delayed. “It was a fire drill,” the D.H.S. official told me. “Chaos is at a new and higher level.” The countries at issue were African nations, such as Nigeria, Chad, and Liberia. “This has literally nothing to do with what’s going on at the border,” the official said. “The people around the President are just looking for something to do.” ","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d7141c92e2c9b85db25","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Stephen Miller","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"stephen-miller"},{"id":"5c2e1dcfb75f002c8941e5d9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration Law","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration-law"},{"id":"5c2e1c934a08312cd3aa6c5d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Department of Homeland Security","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"department-of-homeland-security"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e41e4c73c088d7762","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Kirstjen Nielsen","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"kirstjen-nielsen"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

At the time, the number of Central American migrants arriving at the U.S. border was rising, with fifty thousand people being arrested each month, and the President was blaming her personally. “Why don’t you have solutions?” he demanded at the meeting. “How is this still happening?” Influential figures in the White House, led by Stephen Miller, the President’s senior policy adviser, had long been suspicious of Nielsen’s [establishment credentials](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-dhs-secretary-kirstjen-nielsen-became-one-of-president-trumps-fiercest-loyalists), and Trump, who personally disliked her, had always resented the fact that her mentor, John Kelly, who was then the White House chief of staff, had forced her nomination on him. More than anything else, though, it was the timing of her confirmation, in December, 2017, that made Nielsen particularly vulnerable; it coincided with an uptick in regional migration, which enabled her detractors within the Administration to [portray](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-trump-is-so-angry-at-his-homeland-security-secretary) her to the President as ineffectual and insufficiently loyal to his agenda. Nielsen managed to stay in her post only because there was no obvious way for Trump to remove her. “The Administration can’t get rid of Nielsen,” a D.H.S. official told me that spring. “She doesn’t even have a deputy right now to fill in for her if she leaves.”  \n\nOn Sunday evening, Nielsen still did not have a confirmed deputy to succeed her when, under pressure from the President, she announced her resignation. In March, after months of [steady increases](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trumps-failure-to-address-the-real-crisis-at-the-border) in the number of immigrants arriving at the southern border, U.S. authorities arrested nearly a hundred thousand people. It was the highest rate of monthly apprehensions in more than a decade, and the Department’s enforcement agencies have had to release hundreds of families into the country because the government no longer has the capacity to hold them all. Trump has responded by declaring a national emergency, moving to [cut all aid](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-cycle-of-self-sabotage-at-the-us-border) to Central America and threatening to close ports of entry along the southern border. Publicly, Nielsen supported the President, but privately, one Administration official [told](https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1115021905524854784) CNN, she felt that the situation was “untenable” and Trump was “becoming increasingly unhinged&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and making unreasonable and even impossible requests.” At 5 *P.M.*{: .small} on Sunday, Nielsen travelled to the White House to discuss border policy with the President; when she emerged, the President announced her departure.     \n\nWhat’s most striking about Nielsen’s exit isn’t that she left at a moment of political upheaval, or even that she managed to hang on to her post for as long as she did. In the past year, even as Nielsen pursued the most aggressive enforcement strategy of any secretary in the history of the department, Trump saw her as too weak to be trusted. The Administration’s most controversial immigration policies—from [family separation](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/will-anyone-in-the-trump-administration-ever-be-held-accountable-for-the-zero-tolerance-policy) to the recent overhaul of asylum practices known as [Remain in Mexico](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-radical-gambit-of-trumps-remain-in-mexico-deal)—all happened on Nielsen’s watch. She defended these policies to the press and to Congress and frequently lied in the process. Nielsen continues to claim, for instance, that the Trump Administration never had a policy of separating families at the border. “She was willing to toe the Trump line in ways that were dishonest,” one Administration official told me. “The worst part about her time at D.H.S. is that she hasn’t been an honest broker.” The greatest irony of Nielsen’s tenure may be that, in an Administration full of anti-immigration stalwarts, she was not an ideologue but an opportunist. While she was never a true believer, like Stephen Miller, she became nearly as notorious, having weaponized immigration policy in the battle for her own political survival. \n\nThree days before Nielsen’s resignation, the White House had rejected another immigration official for a top job in the Administration. The President withdrew the nomination of Ronald Vitiello as the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, because Trump wanted to go in a “tougher direction.” Vitiello was a career immigration agent with decades of experience, and both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate signalled their support for his eventual confirmation. The move was so unexpected that officials at D.H.S. initially thought there’d been a clerical error. I spoke to one senior Department official the following day who told me, “We learned the news at the same time you did.” \n\nAlthough Vitiello had few opponents, they were influential. Chris Crane, the militant head of *ICE*{:.small}’s union, and Stephen Miller, at the White House, believed Vitiello was too moderate on enforcement and were able to successfully lobby the President. Trump also faulted Vitiello for something outside of his control—in this case, the fact that *ICE*{:.small} could not legally detain immigrant families indefinitely. *ICE*{:.small} is currently detaining fifty thousand immigrants, a twenty-five-per-cent increase from last year and a record in agency history. But the agency has also been forced to release families near the border, and Trump has complained that it is reverting to “catch and release,” which he associates with the Obama Administration. “Based on the evidence, what else does Vitiello need to do in order to demonstrate his toughness?” John Amaya, the deputy chief of staff at *ICE*{:.small} from 2015 to 2017, said. “Given the politics, laws, regulations, litigation, and operational constraints, what more could the agency accomplish under someone else’s leadership? It must be a wonderful world to live in where you are willfully and blissfully ignorant to the realities of law enforcement and still have your seat in the Oval Office.” \n\nTrump has made immigration enforcement the rallying cry of his Presidency. But his politicization of D.H.S.—and especially of *ICE*{:.small}, its interior enforcement arm—has repeatedly backfired. More than two years into his term, Trump still does not have a confirmed head of the agency. Vitiello’s predecessor, an enforcement veteran named Tom Homan, who came out of retirement to lead *ICE*{:.small}, had [embraced](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/in-calling-for-politicians-arrest-an-ice-official-embraces-his-new-extremist-image) the President’s aggressive rhetoric. Trump praised him for looking “very nasty” and “very mean,” but his close identification with the President also made him politically toxic, and Homan resigned last year, after a tumultuous tenure in which the Senate never confirmed him. “It was a matter of time before Tom would leave,” a former D.H.S. official who knew Homan told me at the time. “It’s a dead-end job. He’s been on TV non-stop talking about what they are doing and defending the Administration’s policies at every turn. Yet, when it came down to legislation and working with members of Congress, he was cut out.” The official added that Homan was “tired of being sent on these missions by the White House to scorch the earth.” Vitiello, who appeared to learn the lesson of Homan’s demise, was careful to tell the President what he needed to hear while also keeping a lower public profile. Trump punished him anyway. \n\nNielsen’s successor as acting head of D.H.S. will be Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (C.B.P.). Current and former department officials have told me that McAleenan is “smart,” “fact-driven,” “intellectual,” and “thoughtful.” A lawyer by training, with a degree from the University of Chicago, he first joined D.H.S. in 2006, as a customs agent in Los Angeles, and later rose to become the deputy commissioner of C.B.P. under President Obama; in March of 2018, the Senate confirmed him as head of the agency. \n\nThe biggest question surrounding McAleenan, who, unlike Nielsen, is seen by both Republicans and Democrats as a credible choice to lead the government’s third-largest federal department, is how quickly Trump will sour on him. McAleenan has already taken public positions that are at odds with the extremist views of the White House. Last December, he praised a new plan at the State Department to increase aid to Central American countries to help improve conditions in the region, and he has continued to speak forcefully about the need for the U.S. to address the root causes of emigration. As head of C.B.P., an agency tasked with policing the border, McAleenan has had limited sway over foreign policy. Now that he’s in a position to play a bigger role in those discussions, he runs the risk of upsetting the President. \n\nAnother concern, typical for anyone in the Administration, is whether it’s even possible for a career public servant like McAleenan to operate effectively, and with integrity, in the face of constant pressure from the White House. “That’s what makes me nervous,” one Administration official told me. “I’m not sure how he can finesse things with this Administration.” McAleenan did not think up the Administration’s family-separation policy, for example, but he did play a role in implementing it. In April of 2018, his name was at the top of a document signed by three agency heads at D.H.S.—including Tom Homan, at *ICE*{:.small}, and Francis Cissna, at Citizen and Immigration Services—arguing that family separation would deter other immigrant families, according to someone who saw the document. In December, as the Trump Administration tightened restrictions at ports of entry and migrants crossed in increasingly remote areas of the desert, two Guatemalan children died in the custody of Border Patrol. “McAleenan is a career civil servant, and I believe he wants to see his job through to the end, regardless of the Administration,” the official told me. In the Trump Era, doing so comes at a high cost.\n\nFor all of McAleenan’s credentials, his new title may be a sign of someone else’s promotion. In a single week, Stephen Miller has successfully torpedoed the careers of two D.H.S. officials and has shown his ever-expanding influence within the Administration. In a recent Oval Office meeting, according to the Washington *Post*, Trump told Miller that he would be in charge of “all immigration and border matters.” There’s been talk of creating a new government post known as Trump’s “immigration tsar,” with ranging responsibilities to implement Miller’s agenda; the names reportedly under consideration—including the former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli and the former secretary of state of Kansas Kris Kobach—are notorious for their partisan and ideological bona fides. Miller appears to hold even greater sway over immigration policy than he did a year ago, and the President, who’s reportedly [championing](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-has-months-been-urging-administration-reinstate-child-separation-policy-n992021) a new policy to separate families at the border, is as receptive as ever. On Sunday, I asked the Administration official whether McAleenan stood a chance of leading the Department under these circumstances. “If Trump wants a negotiator, someone who has a lot of credibility,” the official said, “he has that in McAleenan.” The official then went on to outline a list of policy priorities for addressing the crisis at the border that might achieve some measure of consensus in Washington. “So far,” he added, “there hasn’t been any serious effort to give those a chance.” ","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7e41e4c73c088d7762","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Kirstjen Nielsen","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"kirstjen-nielsen"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c934a08312cd3aa6c5d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Department of Homeland Security","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"department-of-homeland-security"},{"id":"5c2e1c882396212cbb9fc9b0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E.)","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration-and-customs-enforcement-ice"},{"id":"5c2e1dd822d4972cd5b833fa","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Customs and Border Protection","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"customs-and-border-protection"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

You can read the previous installments [here](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-climate-change-is-fuelling-the-us-border-crisis) and [here](http://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-epidemic-of-debt-plaguing-central-american-migrants).*\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn a parking lot next to a mortuary, in the Guatemalan city of San Cristóbal Totonicapán, a small construction business called Ferrocasa has posted a sign decorated with images of columns, moldings, and windows, bearing the slogan “We Will Help You Construct the House of Your Dreams.” The owner, María Ileana Ixcoy, and her sister, who is an architect, paid for their college degrees with money from remittances their father had sent home from the United States. Now the two collaborate on designing and constructing *casas de remesa*, or remittance houses, which have become ubiquitous in the country’s western highlands as a way for immigrants to invest their earnings while living abroad. The process, Ixcoy said, is almost always the same: customers living in the U.S. take photos of houses they like and send them to family members in Guatemala, who then bring the image to a local builder or a firm like Ferrocasa. Ixcoy has never been to the U.S., but she works with a team of designers to re-create the American styles that her customers request. *Casas de remesa*, she said, “have their own architectural aesthetic,” with  multiple bedrooms, shingled roofs, drop ceilings, terraces, and various shades of colored glass.  “Five years ago, the houses were fairly basic,” Ixcoy told me. “Four walls, a simple division of rooms&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  It’s gotten much more elaborate.”\n\n\n\n+++feature-medium\n\n[#image: /photos/5ca7652ce457ec299f1091b3]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\nAs emigration from Guatemala has reached historic levels, a fractious political debate has unfolded in the U.S. over how to stop thousands of people from travelling north each month. The causes of migration are often complex but identifiable: rampant gang violence in urban areas and extreme poverty in the countryside, exacerbated by [climate change](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-climate-change-is-fuelling-the-us-border-crisis). Another, less obvious factor is psychological. With increasing numbers of people leaving, it’s become harder for others to justify staying behind. “There’s a point at which people start to lose hope,” Joy Olson, a human-rights advocate with deep experience in the region, told me. “That’s the most difficult-to-measure problem. If people don’t see a future where they are, and they see it somewhere else, they’re going to go for it.” The *casas de remesa* dotting the landscape in the western highlands are a daily reminder to the residents who remain that opportunity lies elsewhere. “Migration generates more migration,” Lizbeth Gramajo Bauer, a Guatemalan anthropologist at the Rafael Landívar University, told me recently. In 2017, she published a paper with the sociologist José Luis Rocha Gómez about their immigration research in the western highlands. “Remittances and the investments that stem from them create a sense of privation among those who don’t receive them,” they wrote. People who live in areas of high migration in the western highlands, the two concluded, are more likely to emigrate themselves. \n\n+++inset-right\n----------\n\n_This piece was supported by the Pulitzer Center._\n\n----------\n+++\n\n\nOne afternoon, in the city of Quetzaltenango, I had lunch with Willy Barreno, a forty-six-year-old who lived in the U.S. for fourteen years before he returned to Guatemala, in 2010\\.  Barreno is a chef by trade and had worked in the prepared-foods section of Whole Foods, first in New Mexico and later in Texas, Wisconsin, and Illinois. In Quetzaltenango, he runs a group called *DESGUA*{:.small}, which helps deportees from the U.S. acclimate to life in Guatemala after many years away. “The problem is that so many people see all these signs of success in the U.S.,” he said. “Only the signs of success get communicated back to Guatemala, never the hardships of being an undocumented immigrant in America.” He pulled out his phone to show me the Facebook profile of someone he knew who’d moved to the U.S. from Guatemala. We scrolled to a photo of the man smiling broadly, with designer jeans and gelled hair, standing in front of a shiny red car. “I don’t know if that car is even his,” Barreno said. “A lot of people on Facebook pose in front of property that isn’t theirs, just to show that they’re doing well, that their whole trip to the U.S. was worth it. These photos are what Guatemalans end up seeing.” A sense of shame keeps migrants from talking about their struggles, he added.“What people here don’t know is that the immigrant experience in the U.S. is solitary. You deal with racism, and constant work.”\n\n+++feature-large\n\n[#image: /photos/5ca688394e27f13cb67f6e8b]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\nAt the same time, nearly every aspect of life in Guatemala depends on money coming from the United States. Last year, nine billion dollars were sent back to the country in the form of remittances—an amount that is roughly double the total from a decade ago and accounted for more than eleven per cent of Guatemala’s gross domestic product. Donald Trump has announced that he will be cutting all aid to Central America, complaining that the U.S. gives these countries “tremendous amounts of money”; in 2017, the total sum of money the U.S. sent to the region in annual aid amounted to roughly five hundred million dollars, or less than three per cent of the money received in the form of remittances. “People can afford milk and eggs because of the remittances they receive,” Irma Alicia Velásquez Nimatuj, a social anthropologist from Quetzaltenango, told me. “They can build houses. Their children can get an education. And people can start small businesses. The only way poor indigenous women can afford their traditional dress is because of remittance money.” \n\n\n+++feature-medium\n\n[#image: /photos/5ca688c1e71ea219f083726a]||||||\n\n+++\n\nWithout this source of support, Velásquez said, levels of violence would be higher, spending would drop, and poverty would be more extreme. In effect, the stability of village economies has become a function of whether a critical mass  of its citizens can make it to the U.S. When someone wants or needs something—a house, more land to farm, a car, seed money to open a store—the most common way to get it is to leave. “There is no law that’s going to change how many people come to the U.S.,” Velásquez said. “When there’s this level of poverty and inequality in Guatemala, people will always go. They see the example of their families and their neighbors who have gone, and they see how they’ve been able to advance as a result. An average worker in Guatemala doesn’t earn enough to cover his basic living expenses.”\n\n\nEach remittance house in the western highlands tells its own story. Some of the houses are occupied by the wives, children, or parents of men working in the U.S. Others are finished but uninhabited, because their owners decided to stay in the U.S. rather than return home as planned; the sunk cost of an unused home in Guatemala—about thirty thousand dollars—is still not worth more than steady wages in the U.S. Even so, not all of the houses showed signs of success. Many of them remain half built, in some stage of halting progress or abandonment. The owner may have been deported before he could finish paying for the construction, or, as one person told me, “*Cayó en el vicio*”—he succumbed to an addiction, or grew reckless with his money. In a small town on the outskirts of Todos Santos Cuchumatán, in the department of Huehuetenango, several remittance houses had American flags painted onto their outer walls or incorporated in tidy patterns along façades and cornices. I was told the image was both a status symbol and a statement of gratitude to the U.S. as a place of opportunity. But it also seemed to remark on the immediate surroundings, the atmosphere of scarcity that drove people away in the first place. \n\n+++feature-large\n\n[#image: /photos/5ca689092f2cb551dc387799]||||||\n\n+++\n\nOn a Saturday afternoon in February, Israel Vaíl, a forty-eight-year-old father of two, was cleaning up a construction site in his yard, on the outskirts of a town called Cajolá. He is tall and rangy, and wore a blue hard hat. “In the United States, construction workers clean up after they’re finished for the day,” he said. “But here it’s the head of the project who does that.” Vaíl has two sons in the U.S.—a twenty-seven-year-old and a twenty-four-year-old, both in Morristown, New Jersey—and he was overseeing the construction of his younger son’s house. Piles of wood, cinder blocks, and rubble ringed the yard, and chickens wandered around a giant stone oven, where his wife was boiling soup in a small hut covered with a slab of rusted metal.\n\n\n\nThree days a week, Vaíl and his son speak by phone to talk about the project. Vaíl sends him photos and status reports on Facebook, and his son makes requests for modifications. “Here, it’s not always what the designer wants but what the builder is capable of doing,” Vaíl said. “The problem here is that most of the builders have left. Those who didn’t already migrate are going north, to Huehuetenango, where there’s even more construction going on.” His son wanted a large living room in the new house, but it was too expensive and complicated to build. He insisted on having a bathroom in the master bedroom, and Vaíl coördinated with a team of five builders to make it happen. “He wanted it in the American style,” Vaíl said. \n\n\n+++feature-medium\n\n[#image: /photos/5ca6899178f242425e95825c]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\nVaíl also used to live in Morristown, where he worked as a cook for about a decade before returning home, in 2009\\. “The recession made work too hard to find in the U.S.,” he said. Five years later, his children decided to leave. “There was nothing here, so they had no choice,” he told me. His older son’s house, which is next door to the construction site, is already finished; his wife and five-year-old daughter, whom he’s never met, live there, and so do Vaíl, his wife, and Vaíl’s own parents. Vaíl estimated that a quarter of Cajolá’s population had emigrated to the U.S. When I asked why, he pointed to a hundred-pound bag of maize. “That’s Mexican maize,” he said. Since the mid-nineties, large industrial producers in Mexico and the U.S. have been flooding the Guatemalan market with cheap maize; families like Vaíl’s, who used to sell and eat their own, could not compete. “More people living in the U.S. are now sending their money back for houses because of Trump,” he continued. “They want to protect themselves in case they get deported. They need to have a house to come back to.”   \n\nVaíl has been working on his younger son’s house for the past year, and the construction is a few months from being finished. We walked up a flight of stairs, onto the roof. Wood scaffolding rested on a ledge covered in small stone columns, and cinder block walls standing about six feet high left the top floor open to the sky. Metal rods marked where the rooms would eventually be. From this vantage, we had a view of the dirt streets and sloping hills of Cajolá. In every direction, there were clusters of houses being built, in various stages of completion. “All of these houses weren’t here three years ago,” Vaíl said. “Now look at it. There are more houses than people.”\n\n+++feature-large\n\n[#image: /photos/5ca66e54c219612e9d595e76]||||||\n\n+++\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1f9caef5062c9d94aba0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guatemala","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guatemala"},{"id":"5c2e1d4441c92e2c9b85daf0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Construction","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"construction"}],"sections":[{"id":"5a8c99f952e589162b850cbc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Dispatch","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"dispatch"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

couple of years ago, a woman from Mobile, Alabama, who asked that I refer to her only as Jane, owing to “the hostile environment that exists down here,” found out that she was pregnant. She was twenty-one, working her way through school and living with her parents. “My partner and I had only been together for about six months at the time,” she said. (They are still together.) They didn’t want kids—not yet, certainly. She knew that she wanted to get an abortion. But, she told me, “No one had even ever told me that they knew someone who had an abortion, period, in my life. I never heard that before. So I had to figure it out myself.” There had been no anguish for her in the decision, she said. “The difficult parts came when I realized that the options around me were so limited.”\n\nJane learned that Alabama had a mandatory waiting period, which required that women first consult with a counsellor—about not only the procedure but also alternative options—and then wait two days before getting an abortion. Jane also learned that, though Mobile has a Planned Parenthood health center that is licensed to perform abortions, “There hasn’t been a provider on staff for a very long time, because it’s difficult to get someone who wants to commit to working as an abortion provider down here.” Her best in-state option was in Tuscaloosa, about four hours away, a trip that she couldn’t make, given her obligations at school and at work.\n\nOptions for Jane were limited, but they existed. On Tuesday, in Montgomery, the state senate voted on legislation that would make getting a legal abortion in Alabama essentially impossible unless the mother’s health is clearly endangered by her pregnancy. The bill passed 25–6\\. According to numbers collected in 2015 by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the majority of [women who obtain legal abortions](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/state-indicator/abortions-by-race/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) in Alabama are black; every state senator who voted for the bill was a white Republican man. (In the Alabama house, six Republican women voted for the legislation; Democrats walked out of the final vote, which was 74–3 in favor.) On Wednesday evening, the Republican governor, Kay Ivey, signed the bill. When it becomes law, in January, it will make performing an abortion in the state, even in cases of rape or incest, a felony punishable by up to ninety-nine years in prison. (As many people have noted, if a woman were to be raped and get a subsequent abortion, the potential punishment for the person who performed the abortion could exceed that of the person who raped her.) The measure deliberately sets up a Supreme Court showdown over Roe v. Wade. “Until now, [there was no prospect of reversing Roe](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/abortion-law-alabama.html),” Eric Johnston, the president of the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition, who drafted the bill, told the *Times*. Like other anti-abortion activists, Johnston believes that the appointment of [Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brett-kavanaugh) to the Supreme Court has opened the door to that possibility.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cdc779953abc400d2bb9c4d]||||||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n“Lawmakers are using women as pawns,” Barbara Ann Luttrell, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood operations in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi, told me on Wednesday. Last week, Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp, signed a so-called heartbeat bill, which bans abortion in that state at around six weeks, before many women are aware that they are pregnant. So far this year, legislatures in sixteen states, many of them in the South, have either already passed or are considering such laws. Georgia Republicans, too, hope that their law, which will also go into effect in January, could lead to an [overturning of Roe v. Wade](https://www.ajc.com/news/local/could-georgia-abortion-law-challenge-roe-wade/WiipMbWRW8DC6lrl8qzksJ/). Its sponsor, the Republican state representative Ed Setzler, said that it is “[fundamentally different](https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-anti-abortion-heartbeat-bill-heads-governor-desk/V8MsSqg8GJllCz1ByhZKyK/)” from similar laws passed in other states, because it gives “personhood status” to a fetus. In Georgia, someone who “causes the death of another human being irrespective of malice,” in the commission of cruelty to children, can be found guilty of second-degree murder. Legally speaking, then, a woman who has a miscarriage in Georgia could be [investigated for that crime](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/upshot/miscarriages-politics-georgia-law.html).\n\nLuttrell told me that, after the Georgia law passed, Planned Parenthood was “bombarded by hundreds of calls from frightened people across the Southeast.” She added, “These callers don’t understand that it’s still safe, legal, and available in those states.” Following Kemp’s signature, the organization set up a special hotline for women in the region who are unsure of what their choices are.\n\nAs Governor Kemp prepared to go on a three-day “[bill-signing tour](https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2019/05/09/gov-kemp-on-bill-signing-tour-of-south-georgia.html)” of South Georgia, I spoke with a longtime health-care provider who works in that part of the state. She asked me not to identify her, out of concern for possible retribution. “Do we really want to make women and their doctors criminals over something that’s completely legal under federal law, just for some cheap political gain, so the governor can say he’s done this? It’s just not right,” she said. Over the years, she told me, she has referred some forty women to abortion providers in Georgia. The closest abortion clinic for those living in and around her county is roughly ninety minutes away by car, and many of her patients’ primary mode of transportation is their own feet. “There are many people who are just unable to afford it and end up having unwanted children,” she said. Even prior to this new legislation, she added, “it’s been very difficult for a lot of them to get the care they need.”\n\n“I’m sure no one around here is even aware of this bill,” the health-care provider added. The county where she works is rural, and the news is not always easy to find. “Some will find out too late,” the provider said. “I’m sure it will send more people to less safe methods of termination.” Georgia currently has the [highest maternal-mortality rate](https://www.wabe.org/maternal-mortality-georgia/) in the country; black women in Georgia die in childbirth at a rate [three times](https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-african-american-mothers-suffer-higher-death-rates-during-birth/article_d583f5e2-4011-11e9-8176-a321aa1810a6.html) that of the national average. “Race, poverty, and geography intersect down here,” the provider said. “Minority pregnant women are usually poor, and it’s difficult for them to get to prenatal care, which is sixty miles away.” Both Alabama and Georgia have infant-mortality rates that are [among the highest](https://www.statista.com/statistics/252064/us-infant-mortality-rate-by-ethnicity-2011/) in the United States. \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nFor now, the situation in the Southeast is much the same as it was for Jane, two years ago. “I did some research, and there was actually a clinic in Pensacola, which is about an hour drive from where I live,” she told me. They offered same-day appointments, because Florida does not have a waiting-period law. She made an appointment for the next day and left with her boyfriend at four-forty-five in the morning. Protesters stood outside the clinic when they arrived. “A man yelled at me, ‘This place is evil,’&nbsp;” she recalled. Once they got through the security guards, her boyfriend was told that he couldn’t sit inside the waiting room, which was full. The physician whom Jane saw had flown in from another state. “The security is so high, they don’t even hire local people,” Jane said. “The nurses were telling us in the recovery room that, the last time they had a physician who was local, she got harassed. The protesters found her address and started showing up at her house.” Jane added, “So even though, legislatively, Florida is a little bit more relaxed, the culture’s still pretty hostile.”\n\nStill, Jane counts herself lucky. “We had the funds, because my partner had just gotten his student-loan-refund check back,” she said. “We had the luxury of not having to, like, ask anyone else for help. I had a car, so I knew that I could go wherever I needed to.” Jane said that she had not gone more public with her story because “there are inevitably people here who would see it and literally send letters to my home and break the news to my parents before I got the chance to.” She has not yet told them herself.\n\nAfter the bill passed in Alabama, on Tuesday, Jane texted me. “I’m not surprised, but I am embarrassed to be represented by politicians who would waste time and energy passing a bill they know is unconstitutional,” she wrote. “I worry that this will only make it harder for Alabamians who have had abortions to speak openly about it, because it makes it feel like your own state, your own people, are against you. I happen to know that Alabama is actually filled with wonderful, kind, open-minded people who don’t try to force their personal beliefs on others, but for some reason those voices are not represented in Montgomery.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e29430534ce2cb4c56195","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e29430534ce2cb4c56195","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Abortions","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"abortions"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Abortions","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"abortions"},{"id":"5c2e1ed841c92e2c9b85dc20","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ed841c92e2c9b85dc20","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Abortion

Kendrick, a Democrat, who has acknowledged that the legislation was tongue in cheek, later said, “If you’re going to regulate women’s bodies, why not do the same type of regulation on men’s bodies?” Her bill was a response to the [Living Infants Fairness and Equality (*LIFE*{: .small}) Act](http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/Display/20192020/HB/481), which Georgia’s Republican-controlled state legislature passed in late March, adding Georgia to a growing list of states that are attempting to tighten restrictions on abortion. If signed by the governor, the *LIFE*{: .small} Act will effectively ban the procedure after six weeks, when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, and before many women know they are pregnant.\n\n[Stacey Abrams](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/stacey-abrams) has called the *LIFE*{: .small} Act—which passed by one vote—“scientifically unsupportable” and “evil.” The A.C.L.U. of Georgia plans to fight it in court. Earlier this month, some three dozen protesters wearing black held a mock funeral on the third floor of the state capitol, for the seats of lawmakers who supported it. “We were carrying funerary flowers and clipboards identifying each district we’ll work to recall,” Brittany Eames, a twenty-nine-year-old health-nonprofit worker, said.\n\nA few days later, local reproductive-justice activists held an “abortion-positive skate party” at a skating rink in southwest Atlanta. According to Eshe Shukura, who works for the group Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equality (*URGE*{: .small}), which sponsored it, “We really needed this.” Shukura, who is twenty-seven, wore a tight, brightly colored outfit—“a racetrack onesie” for “moving fast and looking cute!”—and sported braids wound into balls. “I’m from Atlanta,” Shukura said. “I remember, when I was young, going to Cascade,” where the party was held, “and teen clubs at Golden Glide and Skate Towne.” Shukura continued, “I’ve lost the ability to skate, somehow, but I knew this was the big event we had to do after a rough legislative session.”\n\nShukura stood in skates behind a table stocked with free items: rainbow-colored koozies, condoms, and magnets that said “*ABORTION: NOT JUST A CISSUE*{: .small}.” On the walls, signs read “*ABORTION, YOU DO YOU*{: .small}” and “*ABORTION: NO SHAME*{: .small}.” “Abortion is a hard thing to talk about for some people,” Shukura went on. “But when you say, ‘Do you think people should have access to health care they need?,’ people usually say, ‘Oh, yeah, that makes sense.’ ”\n\nA mother with five young kids entered the rink. She appeared confused by the condoms at the door. “Hey, we’re having a skate party about abortion positivity—it’s totally free,” Shukura said to her. “Are you down with people having access to health care?”\n\n“Yeah,” the mother said, moving quickly past. The kids went scurrying to get skates. Shukura smiled.\n\nMegan Gordon-Kane sat on a nearby bench watching skaters roll by—youngsters using skate assistants, adults attempting dance moves—as DJ Craig played Mary J. Blige. A twenty-eight-year-old from Atlanta who works at the Feminist Women’s Health Center, Gordon-Kane wore a white T-shirt that read “Support Your Local Girl Gang.” She explained, “My sister got this for my bachelorette party. She’s really extra and wanted to get everyone matching pajamas, but decided that matching feminist T-shirts were way more on brand for me.” Some of the skaters had flashing pacifiers in their mouths. They were for sale in a room nearby.\n\n“This work is hard,” Gordon-Kane said. “The only way we’re going to get through this and come out the other end joyful, happy people, and not let this work burn us out, is to have fun together.” A rink attendant skated by backward, as the d.j. spun Lil Jon. “Georgia has so many problems,” she continued. “But it’s my home and I love it, and I’ll fight anyone who comes down here trash-talking the South. It has so much potential—I can see it. We’re so close to having a state that takes care of its people and maybe isn’t bottom of the barrel in almost every single measure of human welfare.” She added, “I don’t want the tide to turn after I leave—so I’m not going anywhere.”\n\nIt was a weeknight. As the party wound down, a security guard picked up a condom from the table by the door.\n\n“I don’t need one of those,” he said. “I’ve got a baby on the way.”\n\n“Maybe you need a few,” an *URGE*{: .small} representative replied.\n\n“God said be fruitful,” the security guard said, returning to his post. Soulja Boy came on the speakers, and the last of the skaters picked up their pace. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5aff792afd96b760b45cd4e4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Georgia Postcard","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"georgia-postcard"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8b1dd6207318b5db98d","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Charles Bethea has been contributing to *The New Yorker* since 2008 and became a staff writer in 2018.

By then, the *C-J*, as it’s known, was nearly a century old. It was founded in 1868, when two Louisville papers, one that had been opposed to slavery and one that had been in favor of it, merged. (A decade earlier, the papers’ editors had squared off in a duel. Both survived.) For a white-owned, Southern newspaper, the young *C-J* was relatively enlightened on issues of race, supporting improved schooling for blacks—though racial slurs and racist cartoons appeared in its pages. In its early days, news reporting wasn’t the paper’s strong suit. That began to change after it was bought, in 1918, by Robert Worth Bingham, a progressive judge who had married into an oil fortune and saw civic value in good journalism. After the Second World War, the *C-J* moved into a new Art Deco building downtown, and a quote from Bingham was engraved above the elevators in the lobby: “I have always regarded the newspapers owned by me as a public trust and have endeavored to conduct them as to render the greatest public service.” The paper has won ten Pulitzer Prizes, including the Public Service award, in 1967, for its “successful campaign to control the Kentucky strip mining industry, a notable advance in the national effort for the conservation of natural resources.”\n\nJames Bruggers kept a reprint of those 1967 stories on his desk at the office. “I just kept it there all the time because it was inspiration for me,” he told me recently. Bruggers, a gray-haired, ruddy-cheeked man in his early sixties, was the *C-J’s* environmental-beat reporter for nearly two decades. He wrote about mining, air quality, water quality, and environmental job hazards around Louisville and in rural parts of Kentucky. In 2015, he published a series of stories on a massive rural landfill that was fed by “trash trains” full of sewage sludge brought in from out of state; after his reporting, the practice was curtailed. The following year, he wrote about the hauling of radioactive fracking waste to a Kentucky landfill, prompting the approval of new regulations. \n\nIn his years at the paper, Bruggers saw the newsroom and the newspaper grow smaller and smaller. The *C-J* now has a weekday print circulation of around sixty thousand, down from more than two hundred thousand in 2006\\. (Kentucky has about four and a half million residents; three-quarters of a million people live in Louisville.) Last May, Bruggers left the *C-J*, to take a job at the Web site InsideClimate News. He was not replaced.\n\nJudy Petersen, the former executive director of the Kentucky Waterways Alliance, was in frequent contact with Bruggers over the years. “We trusted Jim, and he trusted us for background,” she told me, adding, “We often got good coverage on critical issues.” She pointed to the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (*ORSANCO*{:.small}), which, she said, has periodically looked at “loosening the bacteria standards for safely re-creating on the Ohio River,” which absorbs bacteria-rich overflow from more than a thousand sewers during heavy storms. Bruggers went to Louisville’s poorer west side and talked to people who fish along the riverbank to feed their families. “He asked, ‘Do you know about the mercury in the river that’s in the fish you’re taking home?’&nbsp;” Petersen recalled. They didn’t. “Jim was able to connect all these dots and tell the story of how we have to make sure we adhere to laws and keep protections in place,” Petersen said. “He really blew the story up.” *ORSANCO*{:.small} dropped a proposal to loosen bacteria standards, in 2006, and Bruggers, Petersen said, was “a big part” of the reason. “He demonstrated how important local newspaper reporting is,” she said.\n\nInsideClimate News won a Pulitzer for national reporting, in 2013, and has been a finalist in the Public Service category. But it reports on the country as a whole and does not, in Petersen’s view, have nearly the same impact as the *C-J* in Kentucky. Even in its diminished state, the paper has a particular power where it’s published, Petersen said. “When you get a story above the fold in a major newspaper like the *Courier-Journal*, it typically has a big result,” she told me. “It gets picked up by other media outlets; governors notice it; *ORSANCO*{:.small} commissioners notice it. People start asking questions. People turn out for public hearings.” She added, “When you just have a story on a Web platform, like the one Jim works for now, the reach isn’t the same at all.” \n\nI asked Tom FitzGerald, the director of an influential nonprofit environmental-advocacy group called the Kentucky Resources Council, if he’d noticed any gaps lately in environmental reporting. “We no longer hear anything about environmental issues out west concerning the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant and the [massive contamination](https://www.portsmouth-dailytimes.com/top-stories/32997/doe-waste-facility-at-a-plant-fight-continues) there,” he said, referring to a former uranium-enrichment facility. “In the east, we’ve stopped seeing any coverage of mountaintop removal, and of the squashing of the health-impacts study on mining that the Department of the Interior had authorized and that [this Administration cancelled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/06/13/interior-had-little-basis-for-halting-mountaintop-removal-study-probe-finds/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.e623694458a2). More and more, local news of import is being drowned out by generic *USA Today* coverage—the idea that anything that is more than three paragraphs long is too much for people—and by the fact that, you know, you can basically hold up the entire newspaper and see right through it some days.”\n\n*USA Today* is the flagship publication of the Gannett Company, which bought the *C-J* from the Bingham family, in 1986\\. At the time of the sale, the *C-J* newsroom had grown to more than three hundred employees. It now has around sixty. Gannett [owns more than a hundred](https://www.cjr.org/resources/?c=gannett) publications; as measured by the total circulation of its properties, it is one of the largest newspaper publishers in the country. Most of its media properties are struggling, and a New York hedge fund, Alden Global Capital, has been angling to purchase many of them. (Alden currently owns a seven-and-a-half-per-cent stake in Gannett.) Gannett’s profits sank by nearly two-thirds, from more than two hundred and eighty million dollars to [ninety-seven million dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/business/dealbook/gannett-takeover-offer-mng.html), between 2014 and 2017\\. Last week, [its stock jumped](https://nypost.com/2019/03/20/gannett-shares-jump-on-hedge-funds-confidence-in-takeover-deal/), after another hedge fund expressed confidence that Alden could pull off a hostile takeover of the company. (Gannett disputed the claim.) Alden’s strategy in purchasing Gannett, according to a recent report in the [Washington *Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-hedge-funds-mercenary-strategy-buy-newspapers-slash-jobs-sell-the-buildings/2019/02/11/f2c0c78a-1f59-11e9-8e21-59a09ff1e2a1_story.html?utm_term=.8b9d2b93c9d0), involves “efficiently buying, selling, leasing and redeveloping newspapers’ offices and printing plants.” The company has been called “[a destroyer of newspapers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/business/dealbook/gannett-takeover-offer-mng.html).” Since Alden took over the Denver *Post*, in 2010, that paper has lost nearly half of its staff.\n\nAccording to an Associated Press analysis of data compiled by the University of North Carolina, some [fourteen hundred American cities and towns have lost a newspaper](https://apnews.com/0c59cf4a09114238af55fe18e32bc454) during the past fifteen years. There are now more than a thousand communities in the United States that have no local news source whatsoever; recently, Facebook, which has sucked up much of the advertising money that once went to newspapers, acknowledged that it was [struggling to find the local news](http://www.niemanlab.org/2019/03/facebook-enters-the-news-desert-battle-trying-to-find-enough-local-news-for-its-today-in-feature/) that its users want to read, because, in many places, nobody is reporting that news. A recent study concluded that areas where local papers have disappeared are [more likely to be politically polarized](https://www.apnews.com/ecf440606c824f9d9671f2fb22a2ffce). In 2017, fellows at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism conducted a detailed study of attitudes toward the media in [two Kentucky communities](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/polarization-public-sphere-lessons-from-bowling-green-ohio-county-kentucky.php). They found that residents were more likely to trust local reporting than national reporting and less inclined to see it as politically motivated. \n\nA month after Bruggers left the *C-J*, the paper got its third editor in four years: Richard A. Green, who also oversees smaller *USA Today* publications in the Midwest. I asked Green whether he planned to hire anyone to fill Bruggers’s shoes. He told me that he had recently hired an investigative reporter from another Gannett paper, and that the new hire’s responsibilities would “include environmental coverage,” with a focus on the coal industry, the Ohio River, and climate change. Maybe a quarter of the new reporter’s time would be devoted to environmental stories, Green said, “though we haven’t talked specifics much.” (“We’re going after our eleventh Pulitzer,” he added.) No one will cover the environmental beat full time.  \n\nA former *C-J* reporter, who spoke to me on background, lamented the recent changes at the paper. “The *C-J* used to have bureaus all over the state and in southern Indiana,” she said. “But they’ve retreated and pretty much cover only metro Louisville now. That leaves huge swaths of one of the poorest states in the country without the might of a major metro.” She went on, “That includes the coalfields in eastern Kentucky, some of the poorest places in America, with a long history of being exploited by coal companies who exported their wealth. They are still, and will always be, dealing with the environmental aftermath of mining, and there are fewer local reporters there paying attention.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nFor now, the closest thing that the state of Kentucky has to a newspaper staffer on the environmental beat might be Bill Estep, a general-assignment reporter at the Lexington *Herald-Leader*, the second-largest paper in the state, which has a daily circulation of about fifty thousand. The paper once had a half-dozen bureaus around the state but now has just one, in Frankfort. Estep covers southern and eastern Kentucky and occasionally reports environmental stories. He’s written about the reforesting of areas devastated by coal mining, the perils of oil and gas extraction, and flooding from local lakes. “But I only spend about ten per cent of my time on those,” Estep said recently. “I wish I could do more.”\n\nI visited Estep, a fit man in his late fifties, with a graying goatee, at a tiny office he keeps in the *Herald-Leader’s* one-man Somerset “bureau,” a three-hundred-and-fifty-dollar-a-month room with a flickering fluorescent light, a thirty-five-year-old TV, and stained ceiling tiles. An empty entry room contains a single vacant desk. “When the circulation manager died of a heart attack about ten years ago, they didn’t replace him,” Estep said. “That’s where he sat.”\n\nEstep had just published a piece on a school superintendent accused of having an inappropriate relationship with an employee. “It’s just catch-as-catch-can—if it pops up on your beat or if it’s in your area,” he said, of filing stories like that one. Estep often writes two stories a day in his attempt to cover an eighteen-county area. With the superintendent piece behind him, he turned his attention to a new report on coal-ash pollution in eastern Kentucky. “Here’s an environmental story I have time to do,” he said.\n\nEstep has been at the *Herald-Leader* for thirty-four years, always as a reporter. “They’ve approached me a couple times about being an editor, but that’s not what’s fun,” he said. “Out here is what’s fun.” He grew up near Somerset, in Pulaski County, population sixty-six thousand, in the southern part of the state that was established toward the end of the eighteenth century. “There’s no real claim to fame for Somerset,” Estep said. “People who were coming to Nashville from eastern Kentucky just got tired of walking and stopped here, I guess.” The walls of his office are covered in maps of Kentucky, drawings by his kids, and mug shots of local criminals whose misbegotten careers he likes to follow. “It’s kind of a perverse thing,” he said, pointing at one of the mug shots. “This poor guy, I’ve seen him in three or four different ones, and he looks progressively worse every time.”\n\nLike most overworked reporters, Estep doesn’t have much time to dwell on the bigger problems plaguing journalism as an industry. “You’re probably missing some stories,” he said, when I asked him about the consequences of a state lacking reporters on the environmental beat. Pressed further, he said, “If I were doing only environmental coverage, I’d focus on more big-picture stuff. Like, with the coal industry contracting, what does that mean in terms of the cleanup of old mining sites in eastern Kentucky? Is the money there to do those types of things? No one is covering that. But it would take, you know, digging through a lot of records. Doing a lot of interviews. And things are constantly popping up, which makes it hard to develop these stories.”\n\nWhat else might Estep cover with more time? “I’ve been contacted by some people who say that there’s been a pretty significant increase in logging over the last few years in eastern Kentucky,” he said.\n\nKentucky is a conservative state—nearly twice as many people there voted for Donald Trump as for Hillary Clinton. The Republican Party has a supermajority in the state legislature, which was long controlled by Democrats, and the state has a Republican governor, as well. According to a compilation of state and local polls, only [sixty-two per cent of Kentuckians](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/?est=happening&type=value&geo=state) believe that “global warming is happening,” a number eight points below the national average.\n\nI asked Estep whether locals trust him or see him as just another peddler of “fake news.” “People here understand that I’m, you know, an objective reporter—or attempt to be,” Estep said. “And that what I do is not ‘fake.’ I think where I see more pushback is, you know, against the national media. People are either watching Fox News or MSNBC or CNN, and, I mean, they’re divided by those camps, just like a lot of the rest of the nation. But, with me, I’m just Bill, a guy they see around. It’s useful to be around.”\n\nEstep’s e-mail dinged in the other room. His attention shifted. “If I owned the newspaper here, I’d have two environmental reporters, at least,” he said. “I’d have one really focussing on the coal industry and the outlying areas, and then one in the city of Lexington, because they have a lot of urban environmental issues there. But I don’t own a newspaper.”\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/5c9149fe6c34f42c640ebb32]||||||\n\n+++\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nBarry Bingham, Jr., owned a paper. He was the last of the Bingham-family publishers of the *C-J*. When he died, in 2006, [his obituary ran in the *C-J*](https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/180369377/); in it, he was quoted expressing dismay about the shrinking size and influence of the paper that his family had sold twenty years before. “The Courier Journal is not what it used to be, but on the other hand, journalism in America is not what it used to be,” he said. Bruggers showed me an e-mail that Bingham sent him in 2003, complimenting his stories about air pollution, which he kept taped to his desk. “I have followed the pollution story here for over 40 years but I have never seen such a clear explanation before of the problems the city faces,” Bingham wrote.\n\nDuring his tenure at the *C-J*, Bruggers watched the newsroom’s staff dwindle by some seventy-five per cent. Work spaces were vacated, then entire rooms. The room once occupied by a business department—several reporters and a couple of editors—became the home of a Ping-Pong table and some whiteboards, where staff would hold “meetings or brainstorm sessions,” Bruggers recalled. “Sometimes discussions about pending layoffs,” he added. “What was once the sports department became a work space for Gannett page designers who were helping to assemble other newspapers across the region.” As the paper did less, readers stopped relying on it as much. “We had a statewide mission and the staff that could handle it,” Bruggers told me, of his early years. “People would call from way out in the state and say, you know, ‘My neighbor just put up these chicken barns and the flies are terrible.’ They’d call with some sort of environmental complaint like that. We had the bandwidth to look into those. Then the staff got smaller and smaller, the bandwidth shrinks, and, eventually, the people stop calling, because you can’t help them. You didn’t help them the last time.”\n\nThough Bruggers’s decision to leave the paper was his own—InsideClimate News was “just, like, too bright of a light bulb for me to not go towards,” he said—there was “some stress” about whether he would have been kept around at the *C-J*, he told me. “I’d like to think that, if I’d stayed, I would still be there,” he said. “But, you know, when you have that kind of a drop in staffing, one never knows at what point you get caught up in a buyout or you get laid off or something.”\n\nThe Society of Environmental Journalists, North America’s largest membership association for journalists who cover energy and the environment, has kept track of the employment status of its members since it was founded, in 1990\\. The number who identify as “working for newspapers” has declined to a hundred and seventy, about half of what it was thirty years ago, Meaghan Parker, the S.E.J.’s executive director, told me. Freelancers have picked up some of the slack—total S.E.J .membership is now a little over fourteen hundred, more than twice its original number. But, in Parker’s view, some important things are lost in the transfer of reporting from newspaper staffers to freelance journalists. “A staff reporter focussed on the environment will have the ability to really dig into longer-term issues and develop their own reporting in a way that a freelancer—who is scrambling to get stories and assignments—may not be able to,” Parker told me. What really hurts, she added, “is the loss of coverage of what’s happening locally.”\n\n“The *C-J’s* absence on the coal beat has showed lately,” Al Cross told me. Cross left the paper in 2004, after more than twenty-five years as a staff reporter, to become director of the Institute for Rural Journalism & Community Issues, in Lexington. He is also a professor at the University of Kentucky’s School of Journalism and Media. Cross detailed highlights from the *C-J’s* years of reporting on the coal industry, from the Scotia mine disasters, in 1976, to a series from the late nineties on mine safety which, Cross said, “should have gotten some action out of the Clinton Administration but didn’t.” Then he described to me recent “revelations that black-lung disease in central Appalachia is increasing, apparently caused by the mining of thinner seams that require the cutting of more sandstone, putting silica dust into miners’ lungs.” Those revelations were published, in December, by the PBS investigative series Frontline, after a multiyear investigation by the journalist Howard Berkes, formerly of NPR. (Berkes has since retired.) According to the piece, federal regulators ignored data pointing to [an outbreak of the disease](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/18/675253856/an-epidemic-is-killing-thousands-of-coal-miners-regulators-could-have-stopped-it), which, as a pulmonologist who spoke to Berkes put it, feels like “suffocating while alive.” Health experts say the failed federal response cost lives. Last week, the Associated Press reported that “a tax on coal that helps pay for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was cut sharply Jan. 1 and never restored, potentially saving coal operators hundreds of millions of dollars a year.” The story noted that both President [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) and Senate Majority Leader [Mitch McConnell](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mitch-mcconnell), of Kentucky, have received [large financial contributions from the coal industry](https://apnews.com/07c68ddd6a304e7ca6b020c2b9deb052).\n\nCross now follows Bruggers’s work at InsideClimate News, and he pointed to a series on the lobbying power of the Farm Bureau as “something that the *C-J* probably would have done in the last fifteen years if its Frankfort bureau had not been largely destroyed.”\n\nOther outlets are trying to fill the gaps. Estep noted the arrival of Will Wright, a young *Herald-Leader* general-assignment reporter based in eastern Kentucky who is partially funded by the public-service program Report for America, which works to place early-career journalists with local news organizations. (In January, Facebook announced that it was donating two million dollars to the program.) Tom FitzGerald pointed to increasingly strong local radio coverage of environmental stories—a Whitesburg radio station, WMMT, puts out a weekly “[coal report](https://www.wmmt.org/public-affairs/coal-report/)” and recently did a piece called “[Widows of Miners with Black Lung](https://www.wmmt.org/mtn-talk-widows-of-miners-with-black-lung/).” But, he added, “Nobody is able to do the in-depth work that used to be done.”\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n\n[#image: /photos/5c9149fe1c20e62d0082b494]||||||\n\n+++\n\nAs for what other big environmental stories are being missed, folks in Kentucky often couldn’t say. “It’s hard to know what you don’t know,” FitzGerald said.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nRecently, as Lee Mueller slept in his family home, in Martin County, among the coalfields of far eastern Kentucky, there was, as he put it, a “tremendous rainstorm.” Mueller is a seventy-seven-year-old retired *Herald-Leader* reporter who worked at the paper from 1980 to 2007\\. He had a number of beats; he once interviewed the humorist P. G. Wodehouse on Long Island. (Even though he’d gone to see him in person, Mueller recalled, Wodehouse “still insisted I type my questions and allow him to type his responses.”) He often wrote about environmental issues.\n\nMueller found the rainstorm startling. “This thing came through in the night and caused the damnedest flash flood we’ve had and just about washed my bridge out,” he said, referring to a seventy-foot, four-inch-thick concrete bridge that the Mueller family built on their property. “It swept across the creek bottoms and hollows where my grandfather used to work his sons like slaves, hauling coal with mules,” he said.\n\nIn all the years they’ve been there, as far as Mueller can recall, no weather event ever caused a real change in the topography or features of the land. “But this rain the other night, it nearly took out my bridge and my eighty-three-year-old log barn that my uncles built,” he said. “It filled up the branch with rocks and debris, to a point where it’s almost level with my yard.” The cause, he went on, was a significant increase in local logging. “Since the decline of the coal market, logging has been booming here,” Mueller explained. “There’s more logging trucks than cars out here on the roads. They’ve pretty much clear-cut the hillsides six miles up this creek drainage. All this brush and logs and scrap debris from the logging operation came roaring down the creek and did this damage,” he said. “And who’s writing about it?”\n\nIt wasn’t just logging that concerned him. Mueller mentioned the area’s poor water quality, which he compared to Flint, Michigan’s, and noted the misuse of coal-related tax dollars. “The future looks really bleak for the kids growing up here, and the papers aren’t on top of it,” he said. A few days later, Mueller told me, he’d be attending a going-away party for “eight of our better and best” at the *Herald-Leader*. They are taking buyouts and leaving, he said.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c842396212cbb9fc9a8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Journalism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"journalism"},{"id":"5c2e1c847e716b454591adbb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Reporting","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"reporting"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a397f5b30646d05ec","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Environmentalism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"environmentalism"},{"id":"5c2e1c89397f5b30646d0605","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Coal","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"coal"},{"id":"5c2e1cd1e56e652c902746e6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Newspapers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"newspapers"}],"sections":[{"id":"5a8c99f952e589162b850cbc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Dispatch","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"dispatch"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8b1dd6207318b5db98d","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Charles Bethea has been contributing to *The New Yorker* since 2008 and became a staff writer in 2018.

Many had come from villages in parts of the rain forest that have no roads—journeying by canoe and small plane. They were celebrating a new court ruling, which held that the Ecuadorian government could not, as it had planned, auction off their land for oil exploration without their consent. Nemonte Nenquimo, a Waorani leader, told me that they had come to Puyo to reclaim their right to self-governance and that the verdict had made them feel safer. “The court recognized that the government violated our right to live free, and make our own decisions about our territory and self determination,” she said, over WhatsApp. “Our territory is our decision, and now, since we are owners, we are not going to let oil enter and destroy our natural surroundings and kill our culture.”\n\nIn February, the Waorani, together with Ecuador’s Ombudsman, a parliament-appointed official who serves as a public advocate, had filed a lawsuit against the Ecuadorian government for not properly consulting with them before opening up their territory to potential oil exploration. In recent years, Ecuador has divided much of its portion of the Amazon into blocks to lease the mineral rights in an international auction. One of the blocks included Waorani land. In 2018, the government removed Waorani territory from the auction but said that the region [could still be subject to future drilling](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/indigenous-waorani-sue-ecuadorian-government-land-rights-190411210110279.html). \n\nThe path to the verdict had not been certain. In March, a group of Waorani women [shut down a hearing](https://www.amazonfrontlines.org/chronicles/suspended-waorani-lawsuit/) with song, protesting the conditions under which the case was being tried; they objected to it being held in Puyo, far from the Waorani villages, and to the absence of a court-certified translator. Many of the Waorani representatives wore traditional dress in court and had red bars painted across their cheekbones and brows. Singing a song about their traditional role as protectors of the forest, they drowned out the judge and lawyers until the judge finally suspended the hearing, which was rescheduled for April.\n\nThe crux of the lawsuit was the Waorani’s claim that the government had not properly consulted their community about the oil auction. Nenquimo told me that representatives from the Ministry of Energy and Non-renewable Resources came to her village in 2012, seeking community members’ consent for the auction, but she and her family were out on a hunting trip and didn’t meet with them. Mitch Anderson, the founder of Amazon Frontlines, a non-governmental organization (N.G.O.) that works with the Waorani and other indigenous groups on sovereignty and environmental issues, said that the consultations were treated as a box that needed to be checked off, rather than as a serious  discussion with the community about the impact of introducing oil extraction into the forest lands and rivers where they hunt and fish. Anderson said that language barriers and short visits made the process even more opaque. \n\nOn April 26th, a three-judge panel ruled in the Waorani’s favor, finding that the process did not afford the Waorani free, prior, and informed consent, and that their territory could not be included in an oil auction. The ruling could impact other indigenous groups whose lands are also up for oil exploration. One of the Waorani’s lawyers, Maria Espinosa, said [in a press release](https://www.amazonfrontlines.org/chronicles/waorani-victory/) that the judgment should also be interpreted to mean that “the State cannot auction off the territories of the six other indigenous nations in the southern Ecuadorian Amazon, which were subject to the government’s same flawed and unconstitutional prior consultation process.”\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cdaf8e47bf70b38e5de7dcd]||||||\n+++\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nJust days before the Waorani victory, a coalition of Latin-American journalists unveiled a new reporting project, “[Tierra de Resistentes](https://colombiacheck.com/especiales/tierra-resistentes/es-co/)” (“Land of Resistants”), focussed on the dangers that face environmental activists. Their reporting showed that advocates from ethnic minorities—particularly indigenous people—face a high risk of violent attack from supporters of mining, logging, and other industries. The project, which is supported by Deutsche Welle Akademie, the Pulitzer Center, and others, opens by declaring, “Defending the jungles, mountains, forests and rivers of Latin America has never been this dangerous.” One aspect of the project is a database, compiled by thirty journalists, from Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Guatemala, which documents more than thirteen hundred attacks on environmentalists that took place in these seven countries during a ten-year period, and the project includes in-depth stories about sixteen individual cases.\n\nAndrés Bermúdez-Liévano, a Colombian journalist and the project’s editor, told me over the phone that, as the reporters compiled their stories, certain patterns emerged. Attacks often took place in remote regions, where the government and law enforcement had scant presence, if any. Bermúdez-Liévano told me that [a 2016 report to the U.N.](https://www.protecting-defenders.org/sites/protecting-defenders.org/files/environmentaldefenders_0.pdf) by Michel Forst, the special rapporteur on the situation of human-rights defenders, confirmed a global increase in attacks on environmental groups. Forst’s report said that, in the year 2015, worldwide, more than three environmental advocates were killed every week, often in conflicts related to  expanding mining, logging, damming, or agriculture. Forst found that the people who oppose these activities are often portrayed as “anti-development” or “unpatriotic” and are subject to violent attacks. \n+++inline-recirc\n+++\nIn the stories published by “Tierra de Resistentes,” the physical threats take several different forms. An indigenous community in Ecuador was driven from its village by mining operators. In Peru, a community near the Colombian border was coerced into growing coca. Bermúdez-Liévano said that, although the reporters did not fear for their own safety while in the field, they did take special measures to protect their sources. They often brought people to outside locations to conduct interviews, “away from dangerous eyes,” so that they would not be seen talking to reporters. \n\nBermúdez-Liévano said that the group’s database—which draws on reports from N.G.O.s and governmental officials—is incomplete, but he called it a starting point for documenting an ongoing crisis. It shows how ethnic minorities are being targeted, by oil companies, illegal loggers and miners, and drug cartels.\n\nIn the weeks since the project was published, the violence has continued. In Coloradas de la Virgen, a community in northern Mexico that has been protesting illegal logging and drug trafficking, two activists were killed; both were relatives of a local leader names Julian Carrillo, who was killed in 2018 and whose story is documented by “Tierra de Resistentes.”  In Colombia, one of the leaders profiled in the project, Francia Márquez, was physically assaulted. Bermúdez-Liévano said that the stories revealed a chilling duality: “Latin America has incredible biodiversity and natural beauty. But we also see such a large number of violent attacks on the people who are taking care of these resources.” \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Waorani victory in court stands out. Nenquimo told me that, the night before the verdict, she dreamed about the case and woke up feeling confident that they would win. She carried her spear to the courthouse, as a symbol. “In my blood, I felt my grandfather, and my other ancestors, who protected their territory at the tip of the spear,” she said. When the verdict came down, she was overwhelmed with happiness. She told me, “We have shown the government to respect us, and the other indigenous people of the world, that we are guardians of the jungle, and we’re never going to sell our territory.” \n\nThe following day, Ecuador’s Ministry of Energy and Non-renewable Resources announced, [on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/RecNaturalesEC/status/1122216051633197056/photo/1), a plan to appeal the decision. After the verdict, though, the mood of the Waoranis gathered in the courthouse was celebratory. I spoke with Anderson and Nenquimo on a video call as they began their celebratory march through Puyo. The sun was bright as the group walked away from  the courthouse. Nenquimo was singing and had tears in her eyes. Their cell-phone battery was running low and they quickly signed off. Nenquimo waved into the camera and kept marching. \n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ee32bfcc72cd92d0746","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ee32bfcc72cd92d0746","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ecuador","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ecuador"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Ecuador","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"ecuador"},{"id":"5c2e1f962bc86f2c9a244c58","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1f962bc86f2c9a244c58","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Indigenous People","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"indigenous-people"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Indigenous People","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"indigenous-people"},{"id":"5c2e1fe9d534212cdfecc58e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1fe9d534212cdfecc58e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Oil (Petroleum)","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"oil-petroleum"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Oil (Petroleum)","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"oil-petroleum"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5910a7d92e2e17730741c744","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/rachel-riederer","email":"","name":"Rachel Riederer","socialMedia":[],"title":"Rachel Riederer is a member of The New Yorker’s editorial staff.

Nation became the richest people per capita in the world, after oil was discovered under their reservation, in Oklahoma. Then they began to be mysteriously murdered off. In 1923, after the death toll reached more than two dozen, the case was taken up by the Bureau of Investigation, then an obscure branch of the Justice Department, which was later renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The case was among the F.B.I.’s first major homicide investigations. After J. Edgar Hoover was appointed the bureau's director, in 1924, he sent a team of undercover operatives, including a Native American agent, to the Osage reservation._\n\n\n\n_David Grann, a staff writer at the magazine, has spent nearly half a decade researching this submerged and sinister history. In his new book,_ “_[Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the F.B.I.](https://www.amazon.com/Killers-Flower-Moon-Osage-Murders-ebook/dp/B01CWZFBZ4)_,” _which is being published by Doubleday, in April, he shows that the breadth of the killings was far greater than the Bureau ever exposed. This exclusive excerpt, the book's first chapter, introduces the Osage woman and her family who became prime targets of the conspiracy._\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn April, millions of tiny flowers spread over the blackjack hills and vast prairies in the Osage territory of Oklahoma. There are Johnny-jump-ups and spring beauties and little bluets. The Osage writer John Joseph Mathews observed that the galaxy of petals makes it look as if the “gods had left confetti.” In May, when coyotes howl beneath an unnervingly large moon, taller plants, such as spiderworts and black-eyed Susans, begin to creep over the tinier blooms, stealing their light and water. The necks of the smaller flowers break and their petals flutter away, and before long they are buried underground. This is why the Osage Indians refer to May as the time of the flower-killing moon.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn May 24, 1921, Mollie Burkhart, a resident of the Osage settlement town of Gray Horse, Oklahoma, began to fear that something had happened to one of her three sisters, Anna Brown. Thirty-four, and less than a year older than Mollie, Anna had disappeared three days earlier. She had often gone on “sprees,” as her family disparagingly called them: dancing and drinking with friends until dawn. But this time one night had passed, and then another, and Anna had not shown up on Mollie’s front stoop as she usually did, with her long black hair slightly frayed and her dark eyes shining like glass. When Anna came inside, she liked to slip off her shoes, and Mollie missed the comforting sound of her moving, unhurried, through the house. Instead, there was a silence as still as the plains.\n\n\n\nMollie had already lost her sister Minnie nearly three years earlier. Her death had come with shocking speed, and though doctors had attributed it to a “peculiar wasting illness,” Mollie harbored doubts: Minnie had been only twenty-seven and had always been in perfect health.\n\n\n\nLike their parents, Mollie and her sisters had their names inscribed on the Osage Roll, which meant that they were among the registered members of the tribe. It also meant that they possessed a fortune. In the early eighteen-seventies, the Osage had been driven from their lands in Kansas onto a rocky, presumably worthless reservation in northeastern Oklahoma, only to discover, decades later, that this land was sitting above some of the largest oil deposits in the United States. To obtain that oil, prospectors had to pay the Osage in the form of leases and royalties. In the early twentieth century, each person on the tribal roll began receiving a quarterly check. The amount was initially for only a few dollars, but over time, as more oil was tapped, the dividends grew into the hundreds, then the thousands of dollars. And virtually every year the payments increased, like the prairie creeks that joined to form the wide, muddy Cimarron, until the tribe members had collectively accumulated millions and millions of dollars. (In 1923 alone, the tribe took in more than thirty million dollars, the equivalent today of more than four hundred million dollars.) The Osage were considered the wealthiest people per capita in the world. “Lo and behold!” the New York weekly _Outlook__ _exclaimed. “The Indian, instead of starving to death . . . enjoys a steady income that turns bankers green with envy.”\n\n\n\nThe public had become transfixed by the tribe’s prosperity, which belied the images of American Indians that could be traced back to the brutal first contact with whites—the original sin from which the country was born. Reporters tantalized their readers with stories about the “plutocratic Osage” and the “red millionaires,” with their brick-and-terra-cotta mansions and chandeliers, and with their diamond rings, fur coats, and chauffeured cars. One writer marvelled at Osage girls who attended the best boarding schools and wore sumptuous French clothing, as if “_une très jolie demoiselle__ _of the Paris boulevards had inadvertently strayed into this little reservation town.”\n\n\n\nAt the same time, reporters seized upon any signs of the traditional Osage way of life, which seemed to stir in the public’s mind visions of “wild” Indians. One article noted a “circle of expensive automobiles surrounding an open campfire, where the bronzed and brightly blanketed owners are cooking meat in the primitive style.” Another documented a party of Osage arriving at a ceremony for their dances in a private airplane—a scene that “outrivals the ability of the fictionist to portray.” Summing up the public’s attitude toward the Osage, the Washington _Star__ _said, “That lament, ‘Lo the poor Indian,’ might appropriately be revised to, ‘Ho, the rich red-skin.’ ”\n\n\n\nGray Horse was one of the reservation’s older settlements. These outposts—including Fairfax, a larger, neighboring town of nearly fifteen hundred people, and Pawhuska, the Osage capital, with a population of more than six thousand—seemed like fevered visions. The streets clamored with cowboys, fortune seekers, bootleggers, soothsayers, medicine men, outlaws, U.S. marshals, New York financiers, and oil magnates. Automobiles sped along paved horse trails, the smell of fuel overwhelming the scent of the prairies. Juries of crows peered down from telephone wires. There were restaurants, advertised as cafés, as well as opera houses and polo grounds.\n\n\n\nAlthough Mollie didn’t spend as lavishly as some of her neighbors did, she had built a beautiful, rambling wooden house in Gray Horse near her family’s old lodge of lashed poles, woven mats, and bark. She owned several cars and had a staff of servants—the Indians’ pot-lickers, as many settlers derided these migrant workers. The servants were often black or Mexican, and in the early nineteen-twenties a visitor to the reservation expressed contempt at the sight of “even whites” performing “all the menial tasks about the house to which no Osage will stoop.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nMollie was one of the last people to see Anna before she vanished. That day, May 21st, Mollie had risen close to dawn, a habit ingrained from when her father used to pray every morning to the sun. She was accustomed to the chorus of meadowlarks and sandpipers and prairie chickens, now overlaid with the _pock-pocking__ _of drills pounding the earth. Unlike many of her friends, who shunned Osage clothing, Mollie wrapped an Indian blanket around her shoulders. She also didn’t style her hair in a flapper bob but, instead, let her long, black hair flow over her back, revealing her striking face, with its high cheekbones and big brown eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/59097e8a2179605b11ad94fa]|||\n\nMollie Burkhart.\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nHer husband, Ernest Burkhart, rose with her. A twenty-eight-year-old white man, he had the stock handsomeness of an extra in a Western picture show: short brown hair, slate-blue eyes, square chin. Only his nose disturbed the portrait; it looked as if it had taken a barroom punch or two. Growing up in Texas, the son of a poor cotton farmer, he’d been enchanted by tales of the Osage Hills—that vestige of the American frontier where cowboys and Indians were said to still roam. In 1912, at the age of nineteen, he’d packed a bag, like Huck Finn lighting out for the Territory, and went to live with his uncle, a domineering cattleman named William K. Hale, in Fairfax. “He was not the kind of a man to ask you to do something—he told you,” Ernest once said of Hale, who became his surrogate father. Though Ernest mostly ran errands for Hale, he sometimes worked as a livery driver, which is how he met Mollie, chauffeuring her around town.\n\n\n\nErnest had a tendency to drink moonshine and play Indian stud poker with men of ill repute, but beneath his roughness there seemed to be tenderness and a trace of insecurity, and Mollie fell in love with him. Born a speaker of Osage, Mollie had learned some English in school; nevertheless, Ernest studied her native language until he could talk with her in it. She suffered from diabetes, and he cared for her when her joints ached and her stomach burned with hunger. After he heard that another man had affections for her, he muttered that he couldn’t live without her.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: /photos/59097e891c7a8e33fb3907ce]|||\n\nErnest Burkhart.\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t easy for them to marry. Ernest’s roughneck friends ridiculed him for being a “squaw man.” And though Mollie’s three sisters had wed white men, she felt a responsibility to have an arranged Osage marriage, the way her parents had. Still, Mollie, whose family practiced a mixture of Osage and Catholic beliefs, couldn’t understand why God would let her find love, only to then take it away from her. So, in 1917, she and Ernest exchanged rings, vowing to love each other till eternity.\n\n\n\nBy 1921, they had a daughter, Elizabeth, who was two years old, and a son, James, who was eight months old and nicknamed Cowboy. Mollie also tended to her aging mother, Lizzie, who had moved in to the house after Mollie’s father passed away. Because of Mollie’s diabetes, Lizzie once feared that she would die young, and beseeched her other children to take care of her. In truth, Mollie was the one who looked after all of them.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nMay 21st was supposed to be a delightful day for Mollie. She liked to entertain guests and was hosting a small luncheon. After getting dressed, she fed the children. Cowboy often had terrible earaches, and she’d blow in his ears until he stopped crying. Mollie kept her home in meticulous order, and she issued instructions to her servants as the house stirred, everyone bustling about—except Lizzie, who’d fallen ill and stayed in bed. Mollie asked Ernest to ring Anna and see if she’d come over to help tend to Lizzie for a change. Anna, as the oldest child in the family, held a special status in their mother’s eyes, and even though Mollie took care of Lizzie, Anna, in spite of her tempestuousness, was the one her mother spoiled.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Ernest told Anna that her mama needed her, she promised to take a taxi straight there, and she arrived shortly afterward, dressed in bright red shoes, a skirt, and a matching Indian blanket; in her hand was an alligator purse. Before entering, she’d hastily combed her windblown hair and powdered her face. Mollie noticed, however, that her gait was unsteady, her words slurred. Anna was drunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#image: /photos/59097e8bebe912338a378cbe]|||\n\nMollie (right) with her sisters Anna (center) and Minnie.\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nMollie couldn’t hide her displeasure. Some of the guests had already arrived. Among them were two of Ernest’s brothers, Bryan and Horace Burkhart, who, lured by black gold, had moved to Osage County, often assisting Hale on his ranch. One of Ernest’s aunts, who spewed racist notions about Indians, was also visiting, and the last thing Mollie needed was for Anna to stir up the old goat.\n\n\n\nAnna slipped off her shoes and began to make a scene. She took a flask from her bag and opened it, releasing the pungent smell of bootleg whiskey. Insisting that she needed to drain the flask before the authorities caught her—it was a year into nationwide Prohibition—she offered the guests a swig of what she called the best white mule.\n\n\n\nMollie knew that Anna had been very troubled of late. She’d recently divorced her husband, a settler named Oda Brown, who owned a livery business. Since then, she’d spent more and more time in the reservation’s tumultuous boomtowns, which had sprung up to house and entertain oil workers—towns like Whizbang, where, it was said, people whizzed all day and banged all night. “All the forces of dissipation and evil are here found,” a U.S. government official reported. “Gambling, drinking, adultery, lying, thieving, murdering.” Anna had become entranced by the places at the dark ends of the streets: the establishments that seemed proper on the exterior but contained hidden rooms filled with glittering bottles of moonshine. One of Anna’s servants later told the authorities that Anna was someone who drank a lot of whiskey and had “very loose morals with white men.”\n\n\n\nAt Mollie’s house, Anna began to flirt with Ernest’s younger brother, Bryan, whom she’d sometimes dated. He was more brooding than Ernest and had inscrutable yellow-flecked eyes and thinning hair that he wore slicked back. A lawman who knew him described him as a little roustabout. When Bryan asked one of the servants at the luncheon if she’d go to a dance with him that night, Anna said that if he fooled around with another woman, she’d kill him.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ernest’s aunt was muttering, loud enough for all to hear, about how mortified she was that her nephew had married a redskin. It was easy for Mollie to subtly strike back because one of the servants attending to the aunt was white—a blunt reminder of the town’s social order.\n\n\n\nAnna continued raising Cain. She fought with the guests, fought with her mother, fought with Mollie. “She was drinking and quarrelling,” a servant later told authorities. “I couldn’t understand her language, but they were quarrelling.” The servant added, “They had an awful time with Anna, and I was afraid.”\n\n\n\nThat evening, Mollie planned to look after her mother, while Ernest took the guests into Fairfax, five miles to the northwest, to meet Hale and see “Bringing Up Father,”_ _a touring musical about a poor Irish immigrant who wins a million-dollar sweepstakes and struggles to assimilate into high society. Bryan, who’d put on a cowboy hat, his catlike eyes peering out from under the brim, offered to drop Anna off at her house.\n\n\n\nBefore they left, Mollie washed Anna’s clothes, gave her some food to eat, and made sure that she’d sobered up enough that Mollie could glimpse her sister as her usual self, bright and charming. They lingered together, sharing a moment of calm and reconciliation. Then Anna said goodbye, a gold filling flashing through her smile.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nWith each passing night, Mollie grew more anxious. Bryan insisted that he’d taken Anna straight home and dropped her off before heading to the show. After the third night, Mollie, in her quiet but forceful way, pressed everyone into action. She dispatched Ernest to check on Anna’s house. Ernest jiggled the knob to her front door—it was locked. From the window, the rooms inside appeared dark and deserted.\n\n\n\n\n\nErnest stood there alone in the heat. A few days earlier, a cool rain shower had dusted the earth, but afterward the sun’s rays beat down mercilessly through the blackjack trees. This time of year, heat blurred the prairies and made the tall grass creak underfoot. In the distance, through the shimmering light, one could see the skeletal frames of derricks.\n\n\n\nAnna’s head servant, who lived next door, came out, and Ernest asked her, “Do you know where Anna is?”\n\n\n\nBefore the shower, the servant said, she’d stopped by Anna’s house to close any open windows. “I thought the rain would blow in,” she explained. But the door was locked, and there was no sign of Anna. She was gone.\n\n\n\nNews of her absence coursed through the boomtowns, travelling from porch to porch, from store to store. Fuelling the unease were reports that another Osage, Charles Whitehorn, had vanished a week before Anna had. Genial and witty, the thirty-year-old Whitehorn was married to a woman who was part white, part Cheyenne. A local newspaper noted that he was “popular among both the whites and the members of his own tribe.” On May 14th, he’d left his home, in the southwestern part of the reservation, for Pawhuska. He never returned.\n\n\n\nStill, there was reason for Mollie not to panic. It was conceivable that Anna had slipped out after Bryan had dropped her off and headed to Oklahoma City or across the border to incandescent Kansas City. Perhaps she was dancing in one of those jazz clubs she liked to visit, oblivious of the chaos she’d left trailing in her wake. And even if Anna had run into trouble, she knew how to protect herself: she often carried a small pistol in her alligator purse. She’ll be back home soon, Ernest reassured Mollie.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nA week after Anna disappeared, an oil worker was on a hill a mile north of downtown Pawhuska when he noticed something poking out of the brush near the base of a derrick. The worker came closer. It was a rotting corpse; between the eyes were two bullet holes. The victim had been shot, execution-style.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was hot and wet and loud on the hillside. Drills shook the earth as they bore through the limestone sediment; derricks swung their large clawing arms back and forth. Other people gathered around the body, which was so badly decomposed that it was impossible to identify. One of the pockets held a letter. Someone pulled it out, straightening the paper, and read it. The letter was addressed to Whitehorn, and that’s how they first knew it was him.\n\n\n\nAround the same time, a man was squirrel hunting by Three Mile Creek, near Fairfax, with his teen-age son and a friend. While the two men were getting a drink of water from a creek, the boy spotted a squirrel and pulled the trigger. There was a burst of heat and light, and the boy watched as the squirrel was hit and began to tumble lifelessly over the edge of a ravine. He chased after it, making his way down a steep wooded slope and into a gulch where the air was thicker and where he could hear the murmuring of the creek. He found the squirrel and picked it up. Then he screamed, “Oh, Papa!” By the time his father reached him, the boy had crawled onto a rock. He gestured toward the mossy edge of the creek and said, “A dead person.”\n\n\n\nThere was the bloated and decomposing body of what appeared to be an American Indian woman: she was on her back, with her hair twisted in the mud and her vacant eyes facing the sky. Worms were eating at the corpse.\n\n\n\nThe men and the boy hurried out of the ravine and raced on their horse-drawn wagon through the prairie, dust swirling around them. When they reached Fairfax’s main street, they couldn’t find any lawmen, so they stopped at the Big Hill Trading Company, a large general store that had an undertaking business as well. They told the proprietor, Scott Mathis, what had happened, and he alerted his undertaker, who went with several men to the creek. There they rolled the body onto a wagon seat and, with a rope, dragged it to the top of the ravine, then laid it inside a wooden box, in the shade of a blackjack tree. When the undertaker covered the bloated corpse with salt and ice, it began to shrink as if the last bit of life were leaking out. The undertaker tried to determine if the woman was Anna Brown, whom he’d known. “The body was decomposed and swollen almost to the point of bursting and very malodorous,” he later recalled, adding, “It was as black as a nigger.” He and the other men couldn’t make an identification. But Mathis, who managed Anna’s financial affairs, contacted Mollie, and she led a grim procession toward the creek that included Ernest, Bryan, Mollie’s sister Rita, and Rita’s husband, Bill Smith. Many who knew Anna followed them, along with the morbidly curious. Kelsie Morrison, one of the county’s most notorious bootleggers and dope peddlers, came with his Osage wife.\n\n\n\nMollie and Rita arrived and stepped close to the body. The stench was overwhelming. Vultures circled obscenely in the sky. It was hard for Mollie and Rita to discern if the face was Anna’s—there was virtually nothing left of it—but they recognized her Indian blanket and the clothes that Mollie had washed for her. Then Rita’s husband, Bill, took a stick and pried open her mouth, and they could see Anna’s gold fillings. “That is sure enough Anna,” Bill said.\n\n\n\nRita began to weep, and her husband led her away. Eventually, Mollie mouthed the word “yes”—it was Anna. Mollie was the one in the family who always maintained her composure, and she now retreated from the creek with Ernest, leaving behind the first hint of the darkness that threatened to destroy not only her family but her tribe.","canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-marked-woman","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d632bfcc72cd92d061e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Murder","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"murder"},{"id":"5c2e1c9b41c92e2c9b85da53","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Native Americans","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"native-americans"},{"id":"5c2e1c8bee7fe02cbd16334e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"oil","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"oil"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907eefc98449f3364193d6d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Page-Turner","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"page-turner"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a89c2e2e17730741c79f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"David Grann has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 2003\\.

That far northeast, the state is all water-edged hills and long stretches of humanless, single-lane roads, and it was in full autumnal splendor. Outside the reservation’s tribal office, in a field that was steps away from a shimmering lake, a few hundred Passamaquoddy people gathered to celebrate in pan-Indian powwow style. Donald Soctomah, the tribe’s soft-spoken historic-preservation officer, whom I’d been in touch with by phone, welcomed me to Indian Township. I knew him as the tireless steward of all things Passamaquoddy: he’s a photographer, archivist, museum curator, writer of books, designer of curricula, birch-bark-canoe builder, and former (non-voting) tribal representative to the state legislature. When I met him in person, after hearing his surname mentioned throughout the reservation, I learned that he’s also a father of thirteen. “I’m doing my part to keep the tribe going,” he said, with a rare chuckle.\n\nThe one thing that Soctomah doesn’t do is dance, so we stood at a remove from the drum circle, he in a windbreaker and baseball cap, as other festivalgoers moved clockwise around the yard. They danced in the subtle manner of Passamaquoddys: rod-straight backs; short, light steps; offbeat lifts of the abdomen. There was a solemn moment, too, as the names of those who’d died of illness, addiction, and old age in the previous year were called. In the afternoon, the yard was cleared for the traditional Passamaquoddy hunter’s dance. The fifty-three-year-old Dwayne Tomah, who was wearing a fringed nubuck tunic and a tall feather hat and carrying a small tomahawk, walked to the middle of the field. A hand drum, amplified from the sidelines, projected a gentle beat. Tomah squatted, knees low to the ground, as if he were stalking prey. Then, as the music crescendoed, he leaped, suddenly, into the air.\n\nPassamaquoddy music and rituals have been studied by academics for more than a century, but the tribe, whose name means “people who spear pollock,” has had little say over the use of its cultural property. In 1890, just months before the murder of some hundred and fifty Lakota Indians at Wounded Knee, a mustachioed anthropologist named Jesse Walter Fewkes dragged a state-of-the-art Edison phonograph to Passamaquoddy country. This was during the height of “salvage anthropology,” an attempt to document the many tribes that were being massacred into extinction, and Fewkes had received funding to study the Hopi and Zuni people, in the American Southwest. Before journeying there, he decided to practice recording on the “remnants of the Passamaquoddy.” The wife of the local Indian agent, who served as a liaison with the U.S. government, recruited members of the tribe to sing and speak at Fewkes’s request. For several days, they projected their voices into the giant metal cone of what Fewkes called Mister Phonograph. They told folk stories and performed songs and chants. They watched as a crank-powered needle inscribed thirty-six brown wax cylinders with the sounds.\n\nThe recordings were historic: the first sounds ever captured in the field. But, for the next century, they were held by Harvard’s Peabody Museum, and lost to the tribe. At least one wax cylinder included portions of a funeral ceremony that was intended to be heard only within the community but was made available to the public. Others registered facts about Passamaquoddy commerce and geography that might have been helpful to the tribal government. All of the wax cylinders contained precious audio of people’s grandmothers and grandfathers, in a language that was becoming more endangered with each passing year. In 1980, the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, which had obtained custody of Fewkes’s catalogue, sent cassette-tape transfers of the recordings to the tribe. These tapes arrived at a fateful time. For decades, tribal members had suffered extreme poverty, seen their language banned by the Catholic priests and nuns who oversaw the reservations, and lost their kids to the child-welfare system. But the Passamaquoddy and a sister nation, the Penobscot, propelled by the radicalism of the American Indian Movement, had just won federal recognition and [litigated an unprecedented case](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1982/10/11/restitution-2) against the State of Maine for its seizure of Native territory; the settlement included tens of millions of dollars to purchase a hundred and fifty thousand acres of land. Far-flung members of the tribe were drawn back to the reservations, where their children could learn Passamaquoddy in school and sing traditional songs. The wax-cylinder copies were staticky and difficult to make out, but a few elders recognized sounds from their childhood.\n\nToday, a renewed spirit of indigenous activism, exemplified by the Standing Rock protests, in 2016, coincides with yet another homecoming for the Passamaquoddy wax cylinders. Audio engineers at the Library of Congress are using [new technologies](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/a-voice-from-the-past) to convert all thirty-one surviving recordings into a much cleaner digital format, and, in a Native-first approach to archival work, the library is giving the tribe curatorial control. Soctomah is part of a team that is translating the audio and deciding which songs and stories the Library of Congress should make available to the public; whatever is sacred or private will be kept out of view. Tribal members, on the other hand, will have full online access, thanks to a content-management system designed for the community. According to the Library of Congress, this is the federal government’s most ambitious attempt at a practice known as digital repatriation.\n\n[#iframe: https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/thenewyorker/#file=https://downloads.newyorker.com/mp3/190128-kim-repatriation-audio/kim-1.mp3](100%x60)|||\n*__Audio:__* Peter Selmore, a member of the Passamaquoddy, sings “Esunomawotultine” (which translates to “let’s trade”), more commonly referred to as “Trading Song,” for the anthropologist Jesse Walter Fewkes, 1890, Calais, Maine. This is a digital copy of the original wax-cylinder recording, restored in 2016 by the Library of Congress. (Uploaded with the permission of the Passamaquoddy nation, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University, and the Library of Congress.)\n|||\n\nThe day after Tomah performed the hunter’s dance, I visited him at his secluded barn-style house, in the town of Perry. He lives with his wife, Erica, whom he got to know while working at a clothing factory that was once co-owned by the tribe, and their eight-year-old daughter, Lilliana. Tomah, who’s among the youngest people fluent in Passamaquoddy, described himself as “one of the last language speakers, fighting against time.” In the past year, he has joined Soctomah in the task of transcribing the wax-cylinder recordings. Their process is to listen to one digital file at a time, second by second, mining it for phrases, musical elements, and cultural context. Each file is just two or three minutes long but can demand weeks, even months, of attention.\n\nA handful of the recordings have been analyzed to date; the most musically striking of these is what used to be generically known as “Trading Song.” Today, at both the Library of Congress and on the tribe’s new Web site, PassamaquoddyPeople.com, it’s called “Esunomawotultine” (“Let’s Trade”) and is described as the song of a prospective buyer announcing his presence at a seller’s wigwam. The song begins with a chant (“yonnee yonnee yo”) and—because of its easygoing beat and buoyant melody, and a catchy triplet figure—tends to get stuck in my head. (The ethnomusicologist Ann Morrison Spinney notes that Passamaquoddy singers often “extemporize lyrics” on top of musical “building blocks.”) Taina MarcAurele Mendez, a Passamaquoddy who grew up in Connecticut but spent summers on the Pleasant Point Reservation, told me that she learned a version of “Esunomawotultine” in her youth. “My father sang to me in bed, and my grandfather was in the Passamaquoddy band,” she said. Tomah’s rendition is much slower than Mendez’s. He had taught Lilliana the song from the recording, and, in the family’s living room, asked her to sing along. She was too shy to do so in front of a stranger, but she played the hand drum in synch with her father.\n\n[#iframe: https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/thenewyorker/#file=https://downloads.newyorker.com/mp3/190128-kim-repatriation-audio/kim-2.mp3](100%x60)|||\n*__Audio:__* Taina MarcAurele Mendez, a Passamaquoddy citizen who lives in Connecticut, sings and drums the version of “Esunomawotultine” that she learned in her youth, September, 2018, Pleasant Point Reservation.

In 1978, the Standing Rock Sioux writer Vine Deloria, Jr., criticized this system, arguing that Native people had a “right to know” their past and take charge of their heritage. His vision was partially fulfilled in 1990, through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which required museums and libraries receiving U.S. federal funds to return Native art, human remains, and religious and funerary objects to indigenous communities. Yet the law made no provision for other objects, including photographs, maps, oral histories, films, and audio recordings.\n\nIn 2006, a group of nineteen archivists, librarians, curators, historians, and anthropologists gathered in Arizona to draft a set of best practices for dealing with such materials—an effort to repair what one researcher described to me as our “colonial collecting endeavor.” The resulting guidelines, known as the Protocols for Native American Archival Materials, encouraged holding institutions to open a dialogue with indigenous representatives, to eliminate “outdated, inaccurate, derogatory, or Eurocentric language” in catalogues, and, most controversially, to seek “clearance from Native American communities before accessing sensitive materials.” When the drafters sought an endorsement from the Society of American Archivists (S.A.A.), a battle ensued. Many S.A.A. members thought that it was wrong to prioritize the needs of a small group: If Native communities were given veto power, wouldn’t other minorities demand the same? One librarian called the Protocols “incompatible with our basic professional tenets of open and equitable access to information.”\n\nJennifer O’Neal, a historian and archivist at the University of Oregon and a member of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, who helped draft the Protocols, was disappointed but undeterred by the opposition. She became an evangelist for repatriation, urging her peers to review their holdings. In the past decade, and particularly in the wake of the Standing Rock protests, storage rooms and stacks have become sites of quiet rebellion. The Art Gallery of Ontario changed the name of a painting from the generic “Indian Church” to “Church in Yuquot Village”; the San Diego Museum of Man hired a director of decolonizing initiatives to partner with a local tribe in curation; and the ethnomusicology library at the University of Washington repatriated film of a Hopi snake dance that was meant to be seen only within the tribe. Finally, last August, after twelve years of intermittent debate, the S.A.A. voted to officially adopt the Protocols. It also issued an apology, acknowledging that “many of the original criticisms of the Protocols were based in the language of cultural insensitivity and white supremacy.” (An early critic told me that he had gradually changed his mind about the Protocols while collaborating with local tribes.) For O’Neal, the S.A.A. decision was welcome but a bit “anticlimactic.” “The work goes on whether the Protocols are passed or not,” she said.\n\nThe return of the Passamaquoddy archive involves the work of a large interdisciplinary team. There are, in addition to the librarians and engineers at the American Folklife Center, two academics who specialize in digital repatriation: Kim Christen, at Washington State University, and Jane Anderson, at New York University. Christen manages an open-source content-management program called Mukurtu, the word for “dilly bag” in the language of the Warumungu, of central Australia. Since its launch, several years ago, the software has been used by more than six hundred groups, including the Passamaquoddy, to curate their own Web sites and regulate access in accordance with custom. On the Plateau Peoples’ Web Portal, for example, members of eight participating tribes can log in to view materials specific to their community; the Web site of the Warumungu tribe restricts access to certain items according to gender. The tool is not only for First Nations; Terry Baxter, an archivist in Oregon, is helping Don’t Shoot Portland, a civil-rights group that opposes police violence, use Mukurtu to organize everything from children’s drawings to protest announcements.\n\nFor her part, Anderson has developed a complementary tool, Traditional Knowledge Labels, which labels and licenses content. The idea is to correct for a regime in which the intellectual-property rights to, say, the Passamaquoddy wax cylinders belong to Fewkes rather than the tribe. Though Anderson’s system cannot compel a transfer of legal title, it can, for instance, be used by a First Nation to insist that a ceremonial wampum belt be catalogued in a library as “noncommercial,” “culturally sensitive,” and for “community use only.” Anderson said, “We’re reimagining who actually should have the authority.”\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/5c50a1a837d8ec520248dd23]||||||\n\n+++\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe idea of enlightened archival work might seem esoteric in the sobering context of indigenous peoples’ history. Yet the loss of culture is its own form of structural violence. Between 2013 and 2015, the country’s first government-sponsored truth-and-reconciliation commission gathered testimonies from Native people across Maine who were sent to abusive boarding schools or placed in assimilationist foster care between 1960 and 2013. The commissioners found that the separation of families and the attempted erasure of tribal languages and traditions amounted to “evidence of cultural genocide.” Soctomah and other Passamaquoddys told me that, given this history, the process of reclaiming their language, songs, and dances felt defiant.\n\nFor the tribe’s three hundred and fifty or so known members based in Canada—“We never consented to the border,” I was told repeatedly—the music and stories being culled from the wax cylinders may have an additional, practical use. The northerly Passamaquoddy are nearing victory in a prolonged campaign for federal recognition. Part of this process has turned on establishing the group’s history in the region, which, after so much cultural and population decline, can be difficult to do. “They kept telling me, ‘You have to prove that you exist, that you have community in Canada, that you’ve always had continuity in Canada,’&nbsp;” Hugh Akagi, the chief of the tribe’s St. Croix–Schoodic Band, explained. Several years ago, Akagi heard Wayne Newell, a tribal elder from Maine, sing “Qonasqamkuk,” a war song that appears on one of the wax cylinders. The song references Saint Andrews, a sandy protrusion in Canada that has been occupied by the Passamaquoddy for hundreds of generations. Akagi realized that “Qonasqamkuk” could serve as evidence. “Our very history was in that song,” he said. “It’s another one of those things I point to when they say, ‘You don’t exist.’&nbsp;”\n\nOn my last day in Passamaquoddy country, I visited Newell at the one-story brick house he lives in with his wife, on the southwest end of Indian Township. We were joined by Robert Leavitt, a professor emeritus and former director of the Mi’kmaq-Maliseet Institute, at the University of New Brunswick. Newell met Leavitt, a Jewish man from New Jersey, while studying with him, at Harvard, in the early nineteen-seventies, and Newell convinced him to teach on the reservation. Leavitt began to learn Passamaquoddy and fell in love with the tongue. “There are two genders in the language—animate and inanimate,” Leavitt explained, “and roots with entire ideas wrapped in them, such as shape and direction. And humor.” For about forty years, Leavitt and Newell, along with the late tribal leader David A. Francis, have worked together to develop a written system of Passamaquoddy (which was originally an oral language), assemble an English-Passamaquoddy dictionary, create bilingual school curricula, and publish nearly three dozen illustrated storybooks, one of which I spotted in active use at the Indian Township School.\n\nNewell is seventy-six and ailing, but he was how I imagined he would be, based on newspaper clippings and recordings of his music: warm and optimistic, with thick hair and a sonorous baritone. He told me that, though the Passamaquoddy were pushed from their sprawling Northeast territory to the cold, rocky edge of the continent, they had never stopped demanding what they were owed. He recalled his childhood, when the reservations lacked indoor plumbing and were ruled by nuns who punished kids for speaking their own language. Newell helped negotiate the 1980 land-claims settlement, and saw its benefits lure people home. “There was a time I thought, Who will take over all of this?” he said. “It isn’t just language preservation or cultural preservation; it’s people preservation.” Newell felt heartened by the recent ceremonial-days festival, and also by the return of the wax cylinders. “There are songs on there we can relearn, if that’s the right word,” he said. “We can *learn* them and bring them back.”\n\n*This article was supported by the [Economic Hardship Reporting Project](http://economichardship.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to reporting on American financial struggle.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c9b41c92e2c9b85da53","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Native Americans","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"native-americans"},{"id":"5c2e1f214a08312cd3aa6e7b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Repatriation","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"repatriation"},{"id":"5c2e1c9b2bc86f2c9a2449de","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"American History","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"american-history"},{"id":"5c2e1c8d2bc86f2c9a2449c3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Recordings","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"recordings"},{"id":"5c2e1d9041e4c73c088d7898","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Intellectual Property","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"intellectual-property"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef01ebe912338a371720","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture-desk"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0a55c14b3c606c109f7d","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/e-tammy-kim","email":"","name":"E.

Phalen and I had first spoken in November, [shortly before the amendment passed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/as-told-to/what-it-felt-like-for-a-florida-man-with-a-felony-to-regain-his-voting-rights), with sixty-four per cent of the vote. For nearly a hundred and fifty years, Florida enforced one of the most restrictive voting laws in the country, banning anyone who’d been convicted of a felony from ever participating in elections. Amendment 4 allowed citizens to regain the franchise after serving “all terms of their sentence including parole or probation,” restoring the voting rights of more than a million people. It excluded citizens convicted of murder and sexual offenses. Phalen, who is in his mid-thirties, pleaded guilty, in 2005, to setting fire to a bar while under the influence of alcohol and antidepressants. (He committed the crime in Wisconsin, but, when he moved to Florida, several years ago, he became subject to its voting laws.) He was ordered to pay restitution, serve a year of house arrest, and complete twelve years of probation, which concluded in 2017\\.\n\nRecently, Phalen learned that Republicans in the Florida legislature had proposed a new law, Senate Bill 7066, which would require people with felony convictions to pay all fees, fines, and restitution before they can vote. Phalen has paid about ninety thousand dollars in restitution and insurance expenses, he told me, but still owes more than a hundred thousand dollars in civil liens. On April 30th, as the passage of the bill began to seem assured, he texted his wife, “Guess who is no longer eligible to vote in this backward ass state.” The Florida legislature passed the bill on May 3rd. On Tuesday, Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, declared his intention to sign it into law.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people whose voting rights were restored by Amendment 4 are likely to be in the same situation as Phalen. In the mid-two-thousands, the Florida Department of Corrections estimated that twenty per cent of the people under its supervision, and forty per cent of applicants for case-by-case voting-rights restoration, still owed restitution. Florida, like the U.S. as a whole, incarcerates racial minorities at significantly higher rates than whites, and Democrats have denounced S.B. 7066 as a partisan effort to reduce voter turnout in a swing state. Andrew Gillum, who narrowly lost the Florida gubernatorial election to DeSantis, characterized it as a “poll tax” that disenfranchises citizens of color. (Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, made the same argument on Twitter.) The Florida congressman Charlie Crist, who worked to restore voting rights while he was the Republican governor of Florida, and is now a Democrat, issued a statement: “The people of Florida voted to support second chances, and the Florida legislature should have respected that. Governor DeSantis should veto this bill, and if not, the courts should find it unconstitutional.”\n\nBarbara Richards is the founder of a reëntry nonprofit called Project 180, which provides educational services in Florida jails and prisons, and which has surveyed several hundreds of incarcerated people about fees, fines, and restitution. The majority of respondents owed money, Richards told me, and many owed thousands of dollars. In 2010, the Brennan Center for Justice noted that, since 1996, Florida had “added more than 20 new categories of [financial obligations for criminal defendants](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Justice/FloridaF&F.pdf) and, at the same time, eliminated most exemptions for those who cannot pay.” Richards said, “Some people’s voices will never be heard, because their fees are so high. They’re overwhelming.” Like Crist, she believes that S.B. 7066 deliberately flouts the results of November’s vote. “How dare the Legislature subvert the will of the people, who made it very clear what they want,” she said. “The message is, your voice doesn’t matter.”\n\nWhen DeSantis announced his plan to sign the bill, during an event at the University of Miami, he argued that it was not, in fact, in conflict with Amendment 4\\. The text of the amendment, he noted, requires citizens to complete “all terms of their sentence” before voting. “You can be sentenced with a fine,” DeSantis said. “That’s what the constitutional provision said. I think the Legislature just implemented that as it’s written.” (When I sent questions to the governor’s office, a member of his staff directed me to a video of the event on Facebook.) S.B. 7066, according to this interpretation, resolves an argument that Republicans have been making since December, when the outgoing Secretary of State, under the administration of Governor Rick Scott, claimed that there was “confusion” in the text of Amendment 4.\n\nAdvocates for voting rights generally find this argument [specious](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/opinion/2019/04/22/florida-legislature-cannot-alter-intent-amendment-4-opinion/3538155002/). But there are supporters of the movement for voting-rights restoration who believe that Amendment 4 left the door open for such pushback by not going far enough. Paul Wright founded the monthly [*Prison Legal News*](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/), in 1990, while he was incarcerated in Washington. He believes that Amendment 4 campaigners, particularly the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, were themselves responsible for S.B. 7066\\. He pointed to an exchange, from 2017, between a justice on the Florida Supreme Court and Jon Mills, a prominent attorney and former Democratic lawmaker who advocated for Amendment 4\\. The court, which was charged with reviewing the ballot measure, asked Mills about fees and fines, and Mills said that citizens would need to [resolve those debts](https://www.wlrn.org/post/co-author-and-attorney-floridas-amendment-4-helped-create-statewide-fines-and-fees-policy) before they could vote. “Not only were fines and fees discussed, they were part of the plan,” Wright wrote, in an e-mail.\n\nKirk Bailey, the political director at the A.C.L.U. of Florida, disputed this. He said that Mills’s remarks were about only [one category of fees and fines](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5775917-Florida-Simon-Mauer-Memo.html), which must be paid before a person can complete their parole, and not others, [such as civil liens](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-op-court-costs-amendment-4-fact-or-fake-20190322-story.html). As for the language of Amendment 4, Bailey said that the way it was formulated “seemed to be consistent with how Florida approaches criminal-justice issues, and it was part of feedback we were getting at the time.” Desmond Meade, the president of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, also defended the text of Amendment 4, saying that a word limit made it impossible to define every provision. (The summary description of an amendment cannot exceed seventy-five words.) When I asked him about S.B. 7066, he emphasized that most of Amendment 4 remains intact. “It’s not ideal,” he admitted, speaking of the new law. “However, we are a little encouraged, because we were able to work with Republican and Democratic legislators to at least try to improve the bill.” Meade said that his coalition fought successfully to grant judges the power to excuse debts or to convert them into community-service hours.\n\nMany Floridians, including Phalen, didn’t think of fines, fees, and restitution when they decided to support Amendment 4. Kim Lawrance, a self-described independent voter, and the mother of a teen-ager who is incarcerated for robbing another teen’s home, told me, “We thought that they would be able to vote, that it would just be that easy.” Her daughter will become eligible to cast her first ballot when she is thirty-five, after ten years in prison, ten years of probation, plus payments of six hundred dollars in restitution, a thousand dollars in fees and fines, and several thousand dollars to cover the costs, per Florida law, of her own probation.\n\nIn the meantime, after DeSantis signs S.B. 7066, there will almost certainly be a court fight. “Our view is it definitely does conflict with Amendment 4, and it is ripe for some challenges,” Bailey told me.\n\nWright, who now lives in Florida, had his voting rights restored in Washington State, with help from the A.C.L.U. of Washington. But Amendment 4, he pointed out, did nothing for people who were in his situation: his prison sentence was for murder, and so he is among those whom the legislation was designed to exclude. The amendment was always too narrow, in his view: in addition to excluding those convicted of murder and sexual offenses, it left out those who are on parole or probation, and the currently incarcerated. “They could just as easily have written Amendment 4 to include all people over the age of eighteen, all people not in custody,” he wrote to me. “They could not imagine a universe where everyone gets to vote.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b7e716b454591ada9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b7e716b454591ada9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Florida","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"florida"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Florida","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"florida"},{"id":"5c2e1c9c41c92e2c9b85da55","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c9c41c92e2c9b85da55","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Voting Rights","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"voting-rights"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Voting Rights","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"voting-rights"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5910a7a7da97f12ef9160a60","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/daniel-a-gross","email":"","name":"Daniel A.

Amendment 4 needed sixty per cent to pass and won sixty-four, reflecting [bipartisan support](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/midterms-2018-restoring-voting-rights-to-ex-felons-is-a-rare-bipartisan-issue) in a famously divided state. That leaves only two states, Iowa and Kentucky, that place lifelong voting bans on all citizens with felony convictions.\n\nSteve Phalen, who is thirty-six and works at an *HVAC*{:.small} distribution center in Florida, has not voted since he was a college student. In 2005, while under the influence of antidepressants and alcohol, he set fire to an empty bar in Wisconsin. After pleading guilty to first-degree arson and reckless public endangerment in the second degree, he served a year of house arrest and a dozen years of probation. On Tuesday night, when he learned that Amendment 4 had passed, he wrote, in a text message, “I’ve got one of those full, involuntary smiles and a feeling of agency I haven’t felt in nearly 13 years.” \n\nFloridians have been fighting felony disenfranchisement since the early two-thousands, when civil-rights groups sued the state, unsuccessfully. Under the Republican Governor Charlie Crist, who made more people eligible for partial clemency, more than a hundred thousand Floridians [regained their right to vote](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-ed-charlie-crist-restore-felon-rights-in-florida-front-burner-20170613-story.html). (Crist switched parties in 2012, and won reëlection as a House Democrat on Tuesday.) But those numbers fell sharply under Governor Rick Scott, who adopted a case-by-case clemency system that, according to reporting by the Palm Beach *Post*, [exacerbated racial inequality](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20181025/florida-felon-voting-rights-who-got-theirs-back-under-scott).\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5be0c97c6cc2dd2d8635b3d4]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe new amendment takes effect automatically for citizens who have completed all prison terms, probation, and parole. It excludes those convicted of murder or felony sex offenses. Phalen was reached by phone on Tuesday, while the polls were still open. His account has been edited for clarity and condensed.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n“I think it’s important to start with the conviction. I was living with what is called delayed grief. I lost my father at the age of five—not old enough to understand the ramifications of not coping with that loss. Instead of professional psychological help, I sought alcohol and drugs. That’s like putting a Band-Aid on a significant wound.\n\n“Early on the morning of May 6, 2005, I was walking home alone in downtown La Crosse, Wisconsin. I was a college student at the time. I was pretty inebriated that night. I was walking through alleyways, and at this bar in particular, I just happened to see that there was a hole in the door above the doorknob. I was able to reach through and unlock the door. \n\n“I felt like I was on a different planet. Like there would be no consequences. To this day, I can’t quite articulate what was going through my mind. I’m still uncomfortable talking about it. I was apprehended at the scene, because the fire was giving out smoke. Long story short, a lot of structural damage. No one was hurt. I’m still paying restitution.\n\n“In the state of Wisconsin, when you are on supervision or incarcerated, you lose the right to vote until you are discharged. It’s understandable. I personally don’t think it’s out of line that, while on supervision for a criminal offense, some of your rights as a citizen are suspended. However, there is a part of me that is pretty strongly in favor of voting rights, regardless of incarceration status. As long as you’re paying taxes, and you’re contributing financially to our shared social world, you should have a say in what’s going on.\n\n“I learned of Florida’s ban in June of 2015, when I moved out of Wisconsin with my wife. I met with my probation officer, and she said, ‘You know you can’t vote in the state.’ I was, like, ’Absolutely.’ And I ask a clarifying question: ‘This is just until I’m discharged, correct?’ \n\n“She’s, like, ‘No, you can’t vote in the state of Florida, even after you’ve been discharged.’ And I clarified again. ‘Even though the crime occurred in Wisconsin?’ And she’s, like, ‘Correct. Doesn’t matter.’ \n\n“It was terrible, frankly. I feel civic engagement is incredibly important. Not being able to cast a vote is something that feels like my civic identity, my identity as a citizen, is just completely erased. Made irrelevant. It’s, like, you’re never going to fully be a part of this country anymore.\n\n“I think people change over the course of a life. We become different people as we age. We become different people as we get different experiences. It seems incredibly backward, in our current day and age, that this element of my citizenship would hinge on this twenty-three-year-old version of me that made a terrible decision.\n\n“I heard about Amendment 4 last year, in November. My folks came down from Wisconsin, and at a farmers’ market, we saw someone with a petition, collecting signatures. It turned out to be Amendment 4, granting the right to vote to felons, except murder and sex offenses. I put my signature on that. And it’s been exciting. \n\n“There’s a lot of people in my life that don’t necessarily know I have a conviction. When I share that this would allow me to vote, it does change their mind a little bit. My in-laws are dyed-in-the-wool Republicans. I could see my mother-in-law not voting for that. Not because she doesn’t respect me as a person, but she has a strong moral compass. You know, the whole personal-responsibility thing. But she was telling people to vote for Amendment 4\\. She voted for Amendment 4. I smiled quite big when I heard that.\n\n“I have felt, in some ways, civically helpless, especially in the 2016 election. Especially as someone who lives in the state of Florida. I’m big on social rights. I’m big on social justice. Candidates who don’t promote hate, who don’t promote violence, who instead promote compassion, are going to get my vote.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b7e716b454591ada9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Florida","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"florida"},{"id":"5c2e1c8bee7fe02cbd163351","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Voting","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"voting"},{"id":"5c2e1c88e56e652c9027467a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Midterms 2018","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"midterms-2018"},{"id":"5c2e1c882bfcc72cd92d0544","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Criminal-Justice Reform","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"criminal-justice-reform"}],"sections":[{"id":"595424dfab8b144c1b18882b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"As Told To","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"as-told-to"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7a7da97f12ef9160a60","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/daniel-a-gross","email":"","name":"Daniel A.

It’s the cutest and least objectionable visual agitprop: the politician loves the kids—his own, sure, but also yours—enough to teach them a lesson, firsthand, in civic virtue. We viewers, perhaps slow to our polling places, in need of one final motivational push, receive a small thrill of generational duty—a reminder that democracy, at least in its most surface-level, visible form, is still around, and that we get to raise the people who will wield it next. Hope means teaching them our preferences well.\n\nA photo from Tuesday, taken by Mark Peterson for *The New Yorker*, captures Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee in Florida’s gubernatorial race, participating in this ritual. His son and daughter crowd into the the space between his legs and the ledge of the minimally private voting desk where, presumably, Gillum’s ballot rests. Like all self-respecting children, they’re refusing resolutely to pay attention, to the thing that they’ve been summoned to see: nobody but dad is looking at that sheet of paper. The girl is looking warily into the camera’s eye, receding into her father’s body. The boy leans forward and looks off to the side, probably toward the exit, and pulls Gillum’s arm as if to say, “All done here—let’s get going.” \n\nThose opposite expressions, watchful realism and silly, blasé impatience, might stand in for the warring impulses many of us have been managing all day. In the morning, at my polling place, at Brooklyn College, I saw the long lines and competent volunteers and felt like everything might turn out just fine. Then, later, I watched on Twitter as several friends in New York and strangers in Atlanta, Detroit, and elsewhere reported the same long lines, but also many instances of ridiculous dysfunction—broken scanners, spent batteries, not enough machines. I learned, over Instagram, that my least reliable cousin was working at the polls and felt vaguely inspired at the thought of her participation, but also sort of worried for the voting public in the Bronx. Neither apprehension nor excitement on my part would have any effect on the result, I knew, but what else could I do? I tried to concentrate on work, but kept stopping to click around online and oscillate between the emotional poles.\n\nThe more adult thing is just to vote and go, like Gillum in Peterson’s lovely grayscale chiaroscuro. It’s funny to see the candidate flanked by his kids, given his reliance, during his campaign, on folksy zingers attributed to his beloved grandmother. You can imagine him taking time to pass them down, insuring that his clan will live to roast on into the future. Here, though, he’s all sobriety, bending down to do his business, his head invisible behind the booth’s white blinders, stoic and single-minded next to  his children’s more emotional displays.

It offers new details on the financial mismanagement occurring inside the organization, which had been laid out in an earlier, handwritten memo, dated to July 12th and compiled by Emily Cummins, who was then the N.R.A.’s managing director of tax and risk management. \n\nLast month, The Trace and *The New Yorker* [reported](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/secrecy-self-dealing-and-greed-at-the-nra) on the July 12th memo’s damaging contents, along with a broad array of other revelations culled from public and internal records. Since then, Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, where the N.R.A. is chartered, has opened an investigation into the organization’s tax-exempt status.\n\nAs the depths of the gun group’s fiscal problems have become public, its leadership has attempted to blame Democratic politicians and overzealous regulators for throwing it into a dire financial state. Last month, the N.R.A. also blamed Ackerman McQueen, a public-relations firm that, for almost four decades, has meticulously crafted the organization’s identity and  placed the N.R.A. at the vanguard of the culture wars. The N.R.A. filed a lawsuit accusing Ackerman—historically the gun group’s most expensive vender—of engaging in deceptive business practices. (Ackerman has disputed the lawsuit’s allegations, contending that it was transparent in providing the N.R.A. with “every single piece of information” that the organization requested.)\n\n----------\n\n*This story was published in partnership with [The Trace](https://www.thetrace.org/2019/05/nra-accountants-memo-unexplained-spending/), a nonprofit news organization covering guns in America.*\n\n\n----------\n\n\nThe N.R.A.’s relationship with Ackerman seems to be the most prominent example of an organizational culture that is marked by secrecy, self-dealing, and greed, and has cost the N.R.A. hundreds of millions of dollars through bloated payments, lavish deals, and opaque financial arrangements. The memo to the audit committee appears to show that the N.R.A.’s troubles stretch beyond its dealings with Ackerman. It suggests new examples of unexplained spending, weak oversight, mismanagement, and conflicts of interest among members of the N.R.A.’s senior management. \n\n“As previously stated, the N.R.A. has serious concerns about the accuracy of this reporting and *The New Yorker’s* sources,” William A. Brewer III, a lawyer who represents the N.R.A., wrote. “Of course, we cannot comment on privileged communications or personnel matters—especially in response to out-of-context assertions.” He added, “This ‘report’ is obsolete and misleading. The N.R.A. has a conflict-of-interest policy, and the audit committee reviews all related-party transactions, when appropriate.” The organization, he said, “strives to comply with all applicable regulations.”\n\nOne of the senior N.R.A. executives mentioned in the audit-committee memo is Woody Phillips, who served as the organization’s treasurer and chief financial officer for twenty-six years before retiring, in 2018\\. The document states, without explanation, that the N.R.A. had made “payments” to Phillips’s “significant other.” Brewer challenged the accuracy of the assertion. “Payments were not made to any ‘significant other’ of the N.R.A.’s former C.F.O.,” Brewer wrote. “The N.R.A. hired an I.T. consulting firm with links to a social friend of Mr. Phillips. That firm was interviewed and vetted by the N.R.\nA.’s I.T. department, and its engagement was reviewed and approved by the audit committee.”\n\nThe accountants described invoices submitted by several venders and paid by the N.R.A. as “vague and deceptive.” One questionable arrangement involved Associated Television International, a television-production company. From 1998 to 2014, A.T.I. produced a crime-reënactment show called “Crime Strike,” which featured the N.R.A.’s executive vice-president and C.E.O., Wayne LaPierre. According to the accountants, the N.R.A. paid A.T.I. “$1\\.8M for rental of a house” belonging to David McKenzie, A.T.I.’s president. The accountants do not say who rented the home, why the N.R.A. covered the rental at such an enormous cost, nor what, if anything, was “deceptive” about the bill. \n\nMichael Donaldson, A.T.I.’s outside counsel, confirmed that the company sent the N.R.A. “seven invoices” concerning the house, which added up to “almost $1\\.8 million.” He went on, “The invoices in question were all for refurbishing episodes after completion of the original episodes of ‘Crime Strike,’ ” adding, “the invoiced amounts include not only the house but also various production-related items such as lights, props, and some crew.” Donaldson told me that A.T.I. has “stopped rendering services for the N.R.A. for some time.” “In fact,” he said, “they are now focussed on working on an independent documentary called ‘Inside the N.R.A.’ ”\n\nBrewer, the lawyer representing the N.R.A., said that the audit committee is “addressing those issues” and that the N.R.A.’s “long relationship with A.T.I.” has “resulted in significant benefits for the Association and its members.” Brewer added, “As is true of all such relationships, it is a subject of ongoing review by the N.R.A.”\n\nOther payments questioned in the memo involved Membership Marketing Partners, a fund-raising contractor. In 2017, the N.R.A. paid  the firm nearly twelve million dollars. The Trace and *The New Yorker* previously reported that, in the same year, the N.R.A. paid almost eight hundred thousand dollars for “fundraising counsel” to a firm called Allegiance Creative Group. According to North Carolina state filings, at least ten of Allegiance’s fifteen employees and executives also work at Membership Marketing Partners; one such executive is Gurney Sloan, who serves as the president and C.E.O. of both companies. According to the accounting memo, “MMP bills violate contract stipulations,” though it does not specify which stipulations. \n\nIn addition, the memo drew attention to “senior management override of internal controls,” which led to violations of “accounts payable procedures” and “HR policy,”  including “hiring of staff without HR knowledge.” It names four executives who, at the time, were receiving “reimbursement of expenses relating to apartments and living expenses beyond HR Policy Manual stipulations and on a permanent basis.” The N.R.A.’s accountants added that there was “no contract to support the reimbursement request,” which the four individuals continued to claim as a “relocation expense.” The executives named include Doug Hamlin, the N.R.A.’s executive director of publications; Eric Frohardt, the director of education and training; Joe DeBergalis, the executive director of general operations; and Josh Powell, LaPierre’s chief of staff. \n\nAndrew Arulanandam, the N.R.A.’s managing director of public affairs, said that the organization “has, at times, made such accommodations for employees who travel extensively for their jobs.” He added, “The practice of providing such accommodations is approved by N.R.A. leadership and is not uncommon for an organization the size of the N.R.A.”\n\nJames Fishman, an expert on nonprofit law and a co-author of “New York Nonprofit Law and Practice: With Tax Analysis,” said that the housing payments, along with the other arrangements described in the memo, suggested “that senior people at the N.R.A. are using the organization for their own private benefit.” He said, “That is against the law. The nonprofit is supposed to serve a public purpose, not a private purpose.”\n\nThe N.R.A. hired Powell in 2016, after he ran two high-end clothing catalogues that catered to wealthy outdoorsmen. Businesses that had worked with Powell [sued him](https://www.thetrace.org/2018/10/nra-josh-powell/) on at least twenty occasions, alleging unpaid bills totalling more than four hundred thousand dollars. Powell served as the N.R.A.’s executive director of general operations for roughly two years, until this past December. The organization’s 2017 tax filings revealed that Powell had racked up more than a hundred thousand dollars in personal expenses—including a housing allowance—paid by the N.R.A. In December, 2018, Powell, who is not an attorney, was promoted to “senior strategist” on the N.R.A. legal team that sued Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York Department of Financial Services that spring. \n\nThe memo to the audit committee cites Powell’s multiple conflicts of interest, including N.R.A. payments to his father, a photographer, and the fact that, in late 2017, his wife, Colleen Gallagher, was hired by one of the N.R.A.’s top fund-raising venders, McKenna & Associates. \n\nArulanandam, the N.R.A. spokesperson, said that the audit committee was “aware of the relationship and approved the consulting arrangement with McKenna.” The company, he said, “has for years been a trusted advisor to the association in the area of business consulting, development, and strategic planning.” Toby Merchant, a lawyer representing McKenna, told me that Gallagher was “actively recruited by McKenna” and that she was “hired on the merits of her skills and talents.”\n\nThe memo alleges that McKenna provided “vague project names,” failed to “attach support” for invoices, and operated with “no contract for current work.” Brewer, the N.R.A. lawyer, said there was nothing unusual about shrouding work in secrecy: “As is customary in finance, consulting, and other industries, N.R.A. vendors have occasionally used code names for transactions or projects. This does not mean the N.R.A. lacked knowledge regarding the services rendered. For example, work performed by McKenna & Associates was reviewed, vetted, and approved.” \n\nMerchant, McKenna’s attorney, said that “Senior leadership and the audit committee were well aware of the services and deliverables being provided by McKenna & Associates.” He added that the N.R.A.’s “accounting department” would “not have had access to the confidential details of the McKenna & Associates engagement.” He said that McKenna’s work for the N.R.A. was neither ‘vague’ nor ‘unsupported.’” Any assertion to the contrary, he asserted, “is demonstrably false.” \n\nThough it’s not mentioned in the memo, around the time that Powell became LaPierre’s chief of staff, the organization brought in Dan Winders, the chief operating officer of one of Powell’s catalogues. Winders told me, in a text message, that the N.R.A. had given him a “one-day consultation with their promotional-products team to evaluate their business processes and inventory management.” \n\nThe N.R.A.’s accountants completed their memo in mid-July. Around this period, the N.R.A.’s new C.F.O., Craig Spray, had to temporarily step away from his role at the organization to deal with a health matter. Someone would need to take his place as the organization’s chief manager of financial activities. According to an internal N.R.A. communication, in July, 2018, Powell was appointed acting C.F.O. for about three weeks, placing him in charge of the accountants who documented his conflicts of interest.\n\n“This is norm-breaking across the lines—deeply problematic and definitely not best practices,” Philip Hackney, who worked for five years as an attorney in the Internal Revenue Service’s chief counsel’s office, said. “If all of these allegations are true, you’re talking about nonprofit governance gone bad, with choices resulting in possible theft, which is not in anyone’s interest.”\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b2396212cbb9fc997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b2396212cbb9fc997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guns","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guns"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Guns","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"guns"},{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274660","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274660","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"National

In a letter from early March, Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.’s top executive, warned that liberal regulators were threatening to destroy the organization. “We’re facing an attack that’s unprecedented not just in the history of the N.R.A. but in the entire history of our country,” he wrote. “The Second Amendment cannot survive without the N.R.A., and the N.R.A. cannot survive without your help right now.”\n\nLaPierre is right that the N.R.A. is troubled; in recent years, it has run annual deficits of as much as forty million dollars. It is not unusual for nonprofits to ask prospective donors to help forestall disaster. What is unusual is the extent to which such warnings have become the central activity of the N.R.A. Even as the association has reduced spending on its avowed core mission—gun education, safety, and training—to less than ten per cent of its total budget, it has substantially increased its spending on messaging. The N.R.A. is now mainly a media company, promoting a life style built around loving guns and hating anyone who might take them away.\n\nOn NRATV, the organization’s programming network, the popular host Grant Stinchfield might appear in a “Socialist Tears” T-shirt, taking a sledgehammer to a television set cycling through liberal news shows. The platform’s Twitter account circulates videos of the spokesperson Dana Loesch, a former Breitbart News editor who has said that mainstream journalists are “the rat bastards of the earth” and deserve to be “curb-stomped.” Over menacing images of masked rioters, [she asserts](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-nra-manipulates-gun-owners-and-the-media) that the only way to stop the left is to “fight its violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.” A lawyer and activist called Colion Noir, whose real name is Collins Idehen, Jr., also has a large following. After the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, Noir appeared in a video chiding “all the kids from Parkland getting ready to use your First Amendment to attack everyone else’s Second Amendment.” \n\nLoesch and Noir have become the primary public faces of the N.R.A.; at events, enormous banners feature their images alongside those of LaPierre and Chris Cox, the organization’s top lobbyist. But Loesch and Noir are not technically employed by the N.R.A. Instead, they are paid by Ackerman McQueen, a public-relations firm based in Oklahoma. In at least one year, Loesch earned close to a million dollars, according to a source who has seen her contract.\n\nFor more than three decades, Ackerman has shaped the N.R.A.’s public identity, helping to build it from a niche activist organization into a ubiquitous presence in American popular culture. Ackerman produces the N.R.A. magazine *America’s 1st Freedom* and has devised its most successful ad campaigns, including one called “I’m the N.R.A.,” for which it recruited gun owners, including the actor Tom Selleck and the basketball star Karl Malone, to pose with their weapons. More recently, Ackerman produced a series called “Freedom’s Safest Place,” in which conservative icons inveigh against liberals and terrorists. In a segment from 2016, the country-music star Charlie Daniels warns the “ayatollahs of Iran” that they may be acquainted with “our fresh-faced flower-child President,” but they “haven’t met the heartland—or the people who will defend this nation with their bloody, calloused bare hands.” \n\n\n----------\n\n*This story was published in partnership with [The Trace](https://www.thetrace.org/features/nra-financial-misconduct-ackerman-mcqueen/), a nonprofit news organization covering guns in America.*\n\n\n----------\n\n\n+++\n\nThe N.R.A. and Ackerman have become so intertwined that it is difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins. Top officials and staff move freely between the two organizations; Oliver North, the former Iran-Contra operative, who now serves as the N.R.A.’s president, is paid roughly a million dollars a year through Ackerman, according to two N.R.A. sources. But this relationship, which in many ways has built the contemporary N.R.A., seems also to be largely responsible for the N.R.A.’s dire financial state. According to interviews and to documents that I obtained—federal tax forms, charity records, contracts, corporate filings, and internal communications—a small group of N.R.A. executives, contractors, and venders has extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the nonprofit’s budget, through gratuitous payments, sweetheart deals, and opaque financial arrangements. Memos created by a senior N.R.A. employee describe a workplace distinguished by secrecy, self-dealing, and greed, whose leaders have encouraged disastrous business ventures and questionable partnerships, and have marginalized those who object. “Management has subordinated its judgment to the vendors,” the documents allege. “Trust in the top has eroded.”\n\nIn response to a description of my reporting, Bill Brewer, a lawyer who represents the N.R.A., said that the organization “has serious concerns about the accuracy of this reporting and *The New Yorker*’s sources. Of course, we cannot comment on privileged communications or personnel matters.”\n\nMarc Owens, who served for ten years as the head of the Internal Revenue Service division that oversees tax-exempt enterprises, recently reviewed these records. “The litany of red flags is just extraordinary,” he said. “The materials reflect one of the broadest arrays of likely transgressions that I’ve ever seen. There is a tremendous range of what appears to be the misuse of assets for the benefit of certain venders and people in control.” Owens added, “Those facts, if confirmed, could lead to the revocation of the N.R.A.’s tax-exempt status”—without which the organization could likely not survive.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn its early days, the N.R.A. was more interested in shooting than in politics. It was founded by two former Union Army officers, who returned from the Civil War dismayed at having been outshot by their Confederate counterparts and hoping to inspire a culture of marksmanship in the North. For more than a century, the N.R.A.’s primary concerns were hunting, firearms education, and gun safety. Then, in 1977, a decade after the Federal Gun Control Act restricted firearms sales, activist board members seized control of the group and transformed it into an advocacy organization for gun owners’ rights. Officials knew that this new mission would require a more sophisticated approach to public relations. An N.R.A. executive suggested hiring Ackerman McQueen, which was run by a personal friend. \n\nLater that year, Wayne LaPierre began working for the N.R.A., as a lobbyist. LaPierre, a former Democratic legislative aide with little experience handling guns, was not obviously suited to a role as a firebrand. People who have spent time around him describe him as “mild,” “reserved,” “awkward,” and even “meek.” Still, he rose through the organization, and he built a close relationship with Ackerman. In a deposition concerning a federal-election case, the firm’s then C.E.O., Angus McQueen, said, “I speak to Wayne almost every day. There are exceptions, because I take vacations and he takes vacations. Although he has no reluctance to interrupt mine.” \n\nIn 1991, LaPierre became executive vice-president, the N.R.A.’s top position. He is, by many accounts, reticent about public appearances. According to a story that circulates among staffers, he was once dispatched to appear on a Sunday news show after a school shooting. When a producer entered the greenroom to bring him on set, LaPierre, fretting over talking points, was hiding behind a curtain, with only his wingtips visible. Nonetheless, he appears in videos and makes speeches, often choreographed by Ackerman, that present him as a ferocious critic of the political left. At the N.R.A.’s annual meetings, he disparages “élites” who “long to turn America into some European-style socialist state.” Last year, he told the crowd, “We’re standing at the edge of fear, staring into the abyss of the demise of our country and its freedom we care about most.” He added, “This coming election is a guarantee of our worst nightmares if we don’t win.” A former N.R.A. staffer told me,  “The agency created the Wayne cult of personality.”\n\nEstablished in the early seventies, Ackerman McQueen is a family business. It has about two hundred and twenty-five employees, and offices in Oklahoma City, Dallas, Alexandria, and Colorado Springs. In the past, the company has worked with other national clients, such as the Six Flags amusement parks, but now its roster seems to consist mainly of the N.R.A. and a modest set of regional accounts, including some Oklahoma-based casinos and the Chickasaw Nation. “Most of the agency’s efforts go toward servicing the N.R.A.,” a former senior employee at Ackerman told me. Tax filings for 2017, the most recent year for which records are available, show that the N.R.A. paid Ackerman McQueen and its affiliates more than forty million dollars that year. (Bill Powers, Ackerman’s executive vice-president for public relations, broadly disputed the facts of this article, saying, “It’s like an old Soviet disinformation campaign—you take a little bit of truth and wrap it around a bunch of that things aren’t true.” He declined to point to specific inaccuracies.)\n\nAckerman McQueen provides the N.R.A. with public-relations work, marketing, branding, corporate communications, event planning, Web design, social-media engagement, and digital-content production. It wields great influence over the N.R.A.’s initiatives and is involved with nearly all of the group’s divisions, with the exception of its lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, where, according to former employees, Ackerman’s messaging sometimes undermines the group’s efforts. In 2012, after a gunman murdered twenty children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, LaPierre argued that the best way to prevent such atrocities was to install armed police officers in schools. When President Barack Obama criticized this reasoning, Ackerman responded with an ad noting that Obama’s children received Secret Service protection. An ominous voice-over asked, “Are the President’s kids more important than yours?” At the time, N.R.A. lobbyists were negotiating with federal lawmakers over potential regulations. The organization maintained friendly relations with several Democratic legislators, including Mary Landrieu, a senator from Louisiana. According to a former staffer, the ad caused Landrieu and others to “freak out,” nearly ending those relationships. “Ackerman never cleared that ad with us,” the former staffer recalled. “We had no oversight over Ackerman McQueen.” (Landrieu could not be reached for comment.)\n\nMany N.R.A. employees have long suspected Ackerman of inflating the cost of the services it provides, but its relationships with executives remain strong. For instance, the company has worked closely with LaPierre’s wife, Susan, who maintains an Ackerman e-mail address and was briefly employed there, in the mid-nineties. She now volunteers as a co-chair of the N.R.A.’s Women’s Leadership Forum. Every year, she hosts a luxurious retreat for women who make sizable donations, at which they go on shooting expeditions and mingle with conservative celebrities such as Carly Fiorina and Dick and Liz Cheney. At the N.R.A.’s annual convention, she hosts a W.L.F. lunch and auction. In 2017, she interviewed Trump’s senior adviser Kellyanne Conway onstage, embracing her and calling her “my friend.” Ackerman arranges speakers for these events and provides marketing materials, including glossy brochures that feature photographs of Susan on nearly every page. A former N.R.A. staffer told me that Ackerman “made Susan the face of the W.L.F. project. It pulled Wayne even closer to the firm.” \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn December, 1996, the N.R.A. board’s finance committee gathered at a Hyatt hotel near the Dallas–Fort Worth airport. According to minutes of the meeting, members discussed the fact that “the NRA has been technically insolvent for several years” and “has incurred substantial debt.” The minutes note “improvements in cost containment” but say that the exception was LaPierre, who “directed public relations expenditures, which were significantly over budget ($2,022,900) through the third quarter.” The committee agreed that “in our financial condition the NRA could no longer afford to spend large sums of money on Public Relations . . . nor can it afford to continue [to] allow the EVP to fail to follow the simplest of business procedures—having written agreements with vendors.” \n\nLaPierre promised reforms. As a board member named Weldon Clark recalled, in an affidavit filed with the Federal Election Commission, LaPierre said that he would replace Ackerman with the Mercury Group, a communications firm in Washington, D.C. According to the affidavit, though, an inquiry by board members “revealed that Mercury Group, Inc. was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ackerman McQueen.”\n\nNeal Knox, an influential board member, also urged LaPierre to fire Ackerman, and he agreed. But half a year went by with no apparent action, and Knox warned LaPierre that he planned to have him removed from his post. The following spring, Knox stood for election as an officer, a higher tier of board member. According to the affidavit, Tony Makris, the president of Mercury Group, enlisted the actor Charlton Heston to challenge Knox for the position. Heston, the star of “The Ten Commandments” and “Planet of the Apes,” won by four votes; a year later, he became the N.R.A.’s president. (In the N.R.A.’s version of these events, “In a hotly contested battle, Wayne LaPierre emerged victorious over the dissident board members.”)\n\nAs the relationship between the N.R.A. and Ackerman strengthened, some employees became disgruntled. “Most staffers think that Ackerman is too expensive,” Aaron Davis, who spent a decade working in the N.R.A.’s fund-raising department, told me. “They think they’re just using the N.R.A. to make a massive profit.” Davis, a former special-education teacher from rural South Carolina, started at the N.R.A. in 2005, drawn by the organization’s mission. The staff was underpaid but devoted, with what Davis described as a “rah-rah” attitude. Fund-raising was difficult. Often, Davis told me, potential donors were put off by the N.R.A.’s divisive politics and concerned about what their neighbors would think. He and his colleagues tended to do best with small donors; often, their most successful pitch was persuading people to include donations in their wills. \n\nIn 2010, Tyler Schropp, a former executive at the Mercury Group, was brought in to lead the N.R.A.’s advancement team, a fund-raising group that targets wealthy members. As Schropp reshaped the department, he steered more business toward Ackerman McQueen; Davis recalled that the relationship “skyrocketed.” \n\nSchropp oversaw the production of a magazine, *Ring of Freedom*, which Ackerman had devised to feature wealthy donors. “It was a beautiful magazine,” Davis said. “Rather than do your typical N.R.A. language, which is more hard-hitting, this was meant to tell the stories, the life styles of the donor. So if someone had an airplane, or a collection of Ferraris, we would put that in the magazine.”\n\nN.R.A. employees found the magazines startlingly expensive to produce. “Typically, you’d print around twenty-five hundred copies,” Davis said. “Most of those copies wouldn’t even get used.” At one point, a fund-raising guru came in to give a daylong seminar. “He holds up one of our marketing materials that Ackerman had produced,” Davis said. “He goes, ‘This actually will hurt you. Donors don’t want to see that you’re spending so much money when they give a large gift.’ ”\n\nThe N.R.A.’s tax filings suggest that the advancement team generates only a small portion of revenues, with the “vast majority” of contributions coming instead from “millions of small individual donors.” Still, Schropp’s department spends lavishly; his annual compensation has grown to more than six hundred and twenty thousand dollars. “I was doing fund-raising dinners where wine was pouring freely, and going to dinners with other N.R.A. executives where the bill would be a thousand dollars—just to go out to dinner!” Davis said. He estimated that “at least eighty per cent” of his colleagues brought in less money than they were paid. “I just thought, If the typical N.R.A. member knew that this is how the organization really works, then there’s no way they would give money.” But Davis felt that the culture of the organization discouraged complaints. “If you’re in a war and your commanders are doing something you disagree with, you don’t just go up and question them,” he said. \n\nThe advancement team—roughly thirty staff members—increasingly relied on Ackerman employees. Davis was impressed by their work. “They were topnotch,” he told me. “They did beautiful graphic design, great writing, and we started to lean on them. Over time, we ended up giving almost all of our P.R. projects to Ackerman McQueen.” As the firm’s employees visited the office more frequently, the staff began noticing Lexuses in the parking lot, alongside their own beat-up cars. “I mean, they had a lot going on for them, but they weren’t your folks who were interested in Second Amendment politics,” Davis said. They were “your typical New York or Austin types that are excited about doing really big projects and creative projects. N.R.A. being kind of propaganda gave them the opportunity to do marketing in a way they couldn’t do for any other organization.” He suggested that Ackerman’s approach was impossible to reconcile with the ideals that had drawn him to the N.R.A. “They’re a for-profit organization, trying to do things that would bring more money to them,” he said. “They have completely different intentions than a nonprofit should have, which is for the common good.”\n\nBoard members, particularly those who had served for a long time, grew uncomfortable. Once, Davis recalled, he took a board member to lunch to request a donation: “He just looks at me, and he goes, ‘You know, I like you, but I hate your department.’ I said, ‘Why?’ He says, ‘Because N.R.A. is not fancy Italian shoes with thousand-dollar suits. N.R.A. is the backbone of this country, wearing bluejeans and boots. And your division is taking us to a whole ’nother place.’ ”\n\nIn 2014, Angus McQueen’s son, Revan, got married, in Colorado Springs, in an opulent affair that brought together the most prominent beneficiaries of Ackerman’s work with the N.R.A. Revan had graduated from New York University only five years earlier, but he was being trained to work as the co-C.E.O. of Ackerman McQueen. During the wedding weekend, Revan and his guests, who included Colion Noir and several college classmates, went to a shooting range to practice tactical movements and fire semi-automatic rifles. The ceremony was held at a resort called the Broadmoor, a cluster of Italian Renaissance buildings set on five thousand acres at the foot of Cheyenne Mountain. McQueen sat at a table alongside Tony Makris, of the Mercury Group, and LaPierre. Bill Brewer, the N.R.A. lawyer, who is also McQueen’s son-in-law, sat nearby. The groomsmen, in black tie, toasted one another with twenty-three-year-old Pappy Van Winkle bourbon, which can sell for three thousand dollars a bottle. During the ceremony, the Colorado Springs Philharmonic played on the terrace.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn 2017, visitors to the N.R.A.’s annual meeting, at a convention center in Atlanta, noted a huge banner that ran nearly the full length of the building. It was there to promote a newly launched program called Carry Guard, for members who wanted to protect themselves with firearms. The program offered military-style training, overseen by former Special Forces members, and liability insurance to cover policyholders who had shot people in self-defense. The banner featured an image of Dana Loesch, holding an insurance card and announcing, “I will never carry a gun without carrying this.” On the showroom floor was a Carry Guard virtual-reality exhibit, where participants, equipped with electronic handguns and V.R. goggles, were encouraged to fire away at an armed robber. \n\nAckerman had been deeply involved in developing Carry Guard, and it marketed the insurance aggressively, through e-mail campaigns and an NRATV program called “Carry Guard Daily.” The promotional literature included a guide called “Surviving the Aftermath of a Self-Defense Shooting,” which advised prospective buyers that it was important to “establish for police that you were in fear for your life and did what you felt was necessary.”\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the N.R.A.’s business decisions, Carry Guard was intended to secure the organization’s long-term prosperity. The N.R.A. had spent more than fifty million dollars on the 2016 elections, mostly in support of Donald Trump, and it badly needed revenue. Brian Mittendorf, the chair of the accounting department at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, has analyzed eleven years’ worth of the organization’s public financial statements, starting in 2007\\. In seven of those years, he told me, “the N.R.A. owed more money to others than it had at its discretion to spend.” A financial audit from 2017 revealed that it had nearly reached the limit of a twenty-five-million-dollar line of credit. Additionally, it had been forced to liquidate more than two million dollars from an investment fund, borrow almost four million from its officers’ life-insurance policies, and tap another five million from its affiliated charitable foundation. \n\nCarry Guard inspired controversy from the start. Gun-control activists disparaged it as “murder insurance.” Staff members questioned the value of the program, but, according to the memos I obtained, there was “intimidation of ppl who disagreed.” After the Parkland shooting, in early 2018, the New York State Department of Financial Services advised financial institutions to carefully assess the risks “that may arise from their dealings with the N.R.A. or similar gun promotion organizations.” At the time, the D.F.S. was concluding a long investigation into Carry Guard, which found that the program violated regulations that prevent unlicensed entities from marketing insurance and prohibit insuring a criminal act. In May, 2018, the department said Carry Guard could no longer be sold in the state.\n\nOn May 11th, the N.R.A. sued the D.F.S. and the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, claiming that the department’s actions had caused “tens of millions of dollars in damages.” The group’s lawyers—led by Bill Brewer, McQueen’s son-in-law—framed the dispute as a First Amendment issue, arguing that Cuomo and the D.F.S. had conspired “to deprive the N.R.A. and its constituents” of the “right to speak freely about gun-related issues.” In an amended complaint, the N.R.A. alleged that it had “encountered serious difficulties obtaining corporate insurance coverage, media liability coverage, and basic banking services.” Without such necessities, it said, it would “be unable to exist as a not-for-profit.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nOn the morning of July 30th, the N.R.A.’s audit committee gathered in a windowless conference room at the organization’s headquarters, in Fairfax, Virginia. They were there for an emergency meeting, requested by Brewer. A copy of the day’s agenda notes that the committee discussed “whistleblowing reports.” It also addressed the N.R.A.’s 2017 tax filings, which were due in November. According to two people familiar with the meeting, Emily Cummins, who for twelve years had been the N.R.A.’s managing director of tax and risk management, told the board members that the filings would make unprecedented disclosures about Ackerman McQueen, and briefed them on a series of problematic vender arrangements, each of which had cost the N.R.A. at least a million dollars in the previous year. \n\nCummins declined to comment for the record, but memos that she wrote in the weeks before the meeting give a sense of the issues. One was addressed to Rick Tedrick, the managing director of finance, and titled “List of Top Concerns for Audit Committee.” The memo, written by hand, lists seven areas of primary concern. “N.R.A. pays overbilled, deceptive, vague invoices to ‘preferred’ vendors and contractors,” one entry says. Another notes that “decisions are made in the best interests of vendors,” especially, the memos make clear, those of Ackerman McQueen. A nonprofit’s board is charged with scrutinizing business arrangements and providing fiscal oversight. Yet, according to the memos, the “board hasn’t been told of what’s embarrassing.” \n\nThe 2017 tax filings, prepared at Cummins’s direction, gave the first full accounting of how much the N.R.A. was paying Ackerman McQueen and its affiliates: $40\\.9 million, or about twelve per cent of total expenses that year. Federal regulations require very limited disclosure of how much nonprofit organizations pay their venders, so in previous years the N.R.A.’s filings had not disclosed payments to Ackerman’s affiliates, or any payments that were meant to reimburse expenses. These omissions were probably substantial. The 2017 filing acknowledged a payment of $5.6 million to the Mercury Group, which, despite years of close association with the N.R.A., hadn’t been mentioned in any previous filings.\n\nCummins explained to the board that Ackerman and other venders were generating enormous expenses and getting paid through multiple entities, in a way that obscured payments. One such arrangement involved a company called Membership Marketing Partners, which provides direct-mail fund-raising. In 2017, the N.R.A. paid M.M.P. nearly twelve million dollars. At the same time, it directed almost eight hundred thousand dollars to a firm called Allegiance Creative Group, for “fundraising counsel.” Allegiance doesn’t have a Web site, but, according to state filings, at least ten of its fifteen employees also work at M.M.P. The president and C.E.O. of both companies is Gurney Sloan, who previously worked as a senior vice-president at Ackerman McQueen. This kind of arrangement is not illegal, but, as the former I.R.S. manager Marc Owens told me, “Multiple names for the same entity suggest an effort to disguise the extent of contact. Most organizations have centralized accounting so they can track how much is owed.”\n\nAfter Cummins’s presentation ended, Brewer took over to discuss what the agenda from the meeting refers to as “related party transactions”— arrangements that could improperly enrich N.R.A. leaders or their associates. Before he spoke, most of the staff members were asked to leave the room. But the memos suggest some of the concerns. They assert that about a quarter of the organization’s staff is “now managed by former employees” of Ackerman who have been hired by the N.R.A., creating “financial conflicts of interest.” As an example, the documents note $2\\.6 million paid to a corporate entity called Under Wild Skies, whose annual reports list Tony Makris as president, the same position he holds with the Mercury Group. “Under Wild Skies” is also the name of a TV show, broadcast on the Outdoor Channel, that features Makris and his guests, including Revan McQueen, tracking big game in such far-flung locales as Botswana’s Okavango Delta. (“Under Wild Skies” used to appear on mainstream TV, but NBC Sports ended its run after Makris, on camera, shot an elephant in the face.) According to a recent article in the *Times*, the N.R.A. has paid Under Wild Skies some eighteen million dollars since 2010\\. Until recently, Tyler Schropp, who runs the N.R.A.’s advancement team, the large-donor program, also served as the treasurer of Under Wild Skies. Brewer, the lawyer, told the *Times* that Schropp had “a minuscule interest” in the company, and that he had relinquished his stake. But N.R.A. officials were evidently concerned; in documents filed soon after the audit committee met in July, Schropp’s name was listed among the officers of Under Wild Skies, but had been crossed out by hand. \n\nOne of the memos alleges that “protecting the N.R.A. now means protecting and enriching the officers and Tyler”—a reference to Schropp. His advancement team, despite having dozens of full-time staff members, has paid consultants millions of dollars for “identifying prospective high net worth individuals” and “providing advice and support.” \n\nOne of these venders is Wayne Sheets, who retired from the N.R.A. in 2008 but continued to serve as a fund-raising consultant. According to state filings, Sheets’s contract stipulated a “base monthly consulting fee” of thirty thousand dollars, to be paid “regardless of the number of consulting hours provided by Consultant.” Federal tax records show that, in 2017, the N.R.A. paid Sheets seven hundred and ten thousand dollars. The memos note that he received an additional two hundred and forty thousand dollars in “expense reimbursements.” Cummins wrote that Sheets’s case was “just one illustration” of N.R.A. staff “being told to process payments w/o documentation.” His contract was recently extended through 2023\\. \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe memos frequently note a lack of transparency around questionable payments to individuals. Mike Marcellin worked at the N.R.A. for almost twenty-three years. As a senior employee, he oversaw the organization’s relationship with Lockton Affinity, an insurance administrator that worked on Carry Guard and other N.R.A.-branded insurance products. In 2016, Marcellin retired from the N.R.A. and started a private consultancy. Although he had worked only the first few weeks of January, the organization paid him a full year’s salary—nearly six hundred and thirty thousand dollars, according to tax filings, mostly in the form of a bonus. During the same year, the memos reveal, Lockton paid him about four hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The memos assert that “no one was aware” that Marcellin was receiving income from both organizations—a situation that should have been disclosed on the N.R.A.’s 2016 tax filings. (The payment from Lockton was mentioned on the following year’s filing, with a note that it had been “inadvertently excluded” in 2016\\.) \n\nState records reveal several arrangements that Marc Owens described as “extraordinary.” One involves LaPierre. The records say that his contract “provides for consulting services and personal appearances upon the end of his employment, at an annual rate that starts at his currently contracted final base salary and is later reduced.” LaPierre earns more than a million dollars a year. “I’ve never seen anything like that before,” Owens said. \n\nAnother deal involves Kyle Weaver, the N.R.A.’s former executive director of general operations, who was fired in the fall of 2016\\. That year, he had been paid seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars. According to state filings, he received a hundred and fifty thousand dollars upon his exit, continued to be paid through 2018, and received “a final lump sum” this past January.\n\nWeaver was replaced by Josh Powell, an outdoorsman in his mid-forties. Powell came to the N.R.A. after running two clothing catalogues that catered to men who enjoy adventure, venison, and fine wine. Businesses that had worked with Powell sued him on at least twenty occasions, for unpaid bills amounting to more than four hundred thousand dollars. \n\nPowell has a close relationship with Makris, dating back to at least 2011\\. That year, the two men travelled together to Patagonia, for a photo shoot for one of Powell’s catalogues, in which they are pictured smoking cigars and gazing at the sunset. The accompanying text describes an idyllic two-week fishing and hunting trip: “Bags of Cubans, bottles of Scotch, enough red meat to appease any man, and certainly enough fresh air to make you wonder why you settle for the norm to begin with.” \n\nA recent article in the *Wall Street Journal* revealed that, in late 2017, Powell’s wife, Colleen Gallagher, took a job with one of the N.R.A.’s top fund-raising venders, McKenna & Associates, as a “senior advisor.” Powell told the *Journal* that his wife “works on some N.R.A. business,” and that he had disclosed her employment to the audit committee. But Cummins’s memo to the committee, written half a year after Gallagher was hired, suggests that the board had not been informed. The first item on the page reads, “Josh Powell’s financial conflicts of interest: wife paid by top vendor.” (In a statement, Andrew Arulanandam, an N.R.A. spokesperson, said, “The NRA has a conflict of interest policy, and arrangements are evaluated to ensure they work in the best interest of the organization.”)\n\nNot long after Powell started at the N.R.A., his father began photographing shooting competitions for its publications. In addition, Powell tried to arrange a job at the N.R.A. for a woman with whom he’d had a sexual relationship. Powell admitted to the relationship when he was deposed by a lawyer representing one of his unpaid venders. Ultimately, the woman was not hired.\n\nAccording to filings, the N.R.A. paid Powell nearly eight hundred thousand dollars in 2017\\. In December, 2018, he was moved out of the job of executive director of general operations. According to a company-wide e-mail, he was given a “promotion” to the N.R.A.’s legal team, which he assists as a “senior strategist.” Powell is not an attorney.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nLast August, the N.R.A., in desperate need of funds, raised its dues for the second time in two years. To cut costs, it has eliminated free coffee and water coolers at its headquarters and has frozen its employees’ pension plan. Carry Guard, which was meant to save the organization, has proved disastrous. According to the memos, in 2017, the year that Carry Guard was introduced, Ackerman McQueen received some six million dollars for its work on the product, which included the creation of a Web site and media productions featuring celebrity firearms trainers. The lawsuit against New York State has created an additional burden. Sources familiar with the N.R.A.’s financial commitments say that it is paying Brewer’s firm an average of a million and a half dollars a month. \n\nAn official assessment performed by Cummins last summer dryly describes the N.R.A.’s decision-making during the previous year as “management’s shift in risk appetite.” The document analyzes the organization’s executive-liability exposures and discusses insurance policies that “protect NRA directors and officers from claims by third parties that they have breached their duties, such as by mismanagement of association assets.” From 2018 to 2019, it says, insurance costs increased by three hundred and forty-one per cent. “To say this is a major increase would be an understatement,” Peter Kochenburger, the deputy director of the Insurance Law Center at the University of Connecticut, told me. “This seems to be pretty direct evidence that the N.R.A.’s problems are not due to New York but rather to how the organization conducts itself.”\n\nThe memos urged the audit committee to “step up + fulfill its duties!,” but it’s not clear what the board has done to root out malfeasance. James Fishman, a co-author of “New York Nonprofit Law and Practice: With Tax Analysis,” a leading text on nonprofit law, told me, “There is no such thing as a director who doesn’t direct. You’re responsible to make yourself aware of what’s going on. If the board doesn’t know, they’ve breached their duty of care, which is against the law in New York,” where the N.R.A. is chartered. According to Owens, the former I.R.S. official, New York State “could sanction board members, remove board members, disband the board, or close down the organization entirely.” \n\nSince the emergency meeting in July, sources familiar with the board’s decisions say, the audit committee has retroactively signed off on at least some of the N.R.A.’s problematic transactions. “That does legitimize them,” Owens said, “but a regulator would want to know why the process was unfolding this way, especially if it’s part of a larger pattern.” Last fall, the N.R.A. made its 2017 tax filings public, revealing its payments to Ackerman McQueen and its affiliates. I asked the N.R.A., at the time, why it had made these disclosures, and a spokesperson told me that it was “in an effort to offer greater visibility into the dealings of the Association and foundation.” On April 12th, the N.R.A. embarked on another lawsuit—against Ackerman McQueen. The suit alleges that Ackerman has denied the N.R.A. access to basic business records, including the terms of Oliver North’s contract, and blames the firm for throwing it into an existential crisis. Ackerman’s general lack of transparency, the complaint says, “threatens to imminently and irreparably harm” the N.R.A.’s status as a nonprofit organization. (In response, the marketing firm issued a statement saying it “has served the NRA and its members with great pride and dedication for the last 38 years. The NRA’s action is frivolous, inaccurate and intended to cause harm to the reputation of our company and the future of that 38-year relationship.”)\n\nBut the N.R.A.’s leaders also remain focussed on threats from outside. On March 2nd, LaPierre delivered his annual speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. He told the crowd, “In real time right before your very eyes, we, the National Rifle Association, on behalf of all Americans, are fighting perhaps the most important piece of First Amendment constitutional advocacy in the history of our country.” The suit against New York State, he said, “will decide whether or not government can be weaponized against you if your opinion differs from theirs.” The N.R.A. now has a Web page devoted to soliciting donations to support the suit. “Please give as generously as you can,” the text urges, “and help win this life-or-death legal battle for the survival of the N.R.A. and freedom.”\n\n*This piece has been updated to include a response from Ackerman McQueen and to correct a misspelling of the board member Neal Knox’s name.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1da341c92e2c9b85db63","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"N.R.A.","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"nra"},{"id":"5c2e1eb8b75f002c8941e678","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Wayne LaPierre","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"wayne-lapierre"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a6656c4c222f03a82d63","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/mike-spies","email":"","name":"Mike Spies","socialMedia":[],"title":"Mike Spies is a staff writer at The Trace and a 2017 Livingston Awards finalist."}]},"dek":"The organization’s leadership is focussed on external threats, but the real crisis may be internal.","hed":"Secrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2019-04-19T18:55:00.639Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5cb5f9ebfc1f8c3868bc2389","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"2:1":{"width":1836,"height":918,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":310,"y":125,"height":918,"width":1836}},"duration":null},"2:2":{"width":1044,"height":1044,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":694,"y":137,"height":1044,"width":1044}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":2400,"height":1350,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":1350,"width":2400}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":2083,"height":1562,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":158,"y":0,"height":1562,"width":2083}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":2400,"height":2400,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":2400,"width":2400,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2019/04/16/5cb5f9ebfc1f8c3868bc2388_Spies-nra.jpg","width":2400,"height":2400,"duration":null}},"altText":"Eagle flying over guns dropping money","credit":"Illustration by Ben Wiseman","filename":"Spies-nra.jpg","revision":1,"tags":[],"title":"","variants":{}}]},"promoDek":"The organization’s leadership is focussed on external threats, but the real crisis may be internal.","promoHed":"Secrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.","pubDate":"2019-04-17T23:10:00.000Z","related":[],"rubric":"","seoDescription":"Mike Spies reports on internal memos from the N.R.A. detailing the organization’s relationship with the public-relations firm Ackerman McQueen.","seoTitle":"Secrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.","socialDescription":"The organization’s leadership is focussed on external threats, but the real crisis may be internal.","socialTitle":"Secrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.","subChannel":"News Desk","tags":["N.R.A.","Wayne LaPierre"],"template":"standard","url":"/news/news-desk/secrecy-self-dealing-and-greed-at-the-nra","videos":{}},{"id":"5cb5f1c903cb6f21274ce802","modelName":"article","collection":"articles","body":"-=-=-=-\n\nOn the afternoon of Good Friday in April, 2010, Shane Claiborne, a thirty-five-year-old evangelical activist sporting dreadlocks and homemade pants, followed a group of teen-agers carrying an eight-foot-tall wooden cross down a street in North Philadelphia. They marched to a gun store in Kensington called the Shooter Shop, which was notorious for allowing straw buyers to purchase guns illegally. Philadelphia has been hit hard by the heroin epidemic and its associated gun violence. In 2010, some two hundred and fifty people were killed with guns in the city, and more than a thousand people have been killed in the last four years—far more than in Los Angeles, though it has a much larger population. Claiborne—along with hundreds of members of Heeding God’s Call to End Gun Violence, a faith-based group that advocates for gun reform—was going to hold a vigil outside the shop to convince its owner to adopt a ten-point code of conduct to render the store more accountable for the weapons it sold.\n\nWhen the protesters arrived, they found a group of counter-protesters lining the sidewalk and waving American flags. Claiborne led a recitation of the Lord’s Prayer while the counter-protesters loudly chanted the words to “God Bless America.” Then Claiborne told the crowd about a night, a month earlier, when he’d heard gunfire coming from outside his home and ran out the door to find a young man named Papito bleeding in the street. Claiborne held Papito’s hand until an ambulance arrived, but he died later that day. At the end of the rally, a woman approached Claiborne and told him that she was Papito’s mother. “I understand something I hadn’t understood before,” he recalled her saying. “God knows what it feels like to lose a son.”\n\nClaiborne refers to himself as a “holy troublemaker,” and over the past decade he has become something of a celebrity in Christian circles, for challenging believers to scrutinize the difference between the Bible’s teachings and those espoused in conservative American culture. His first book, “[The Irresistible Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Irresistible-Revolution-Living-Ordinary-Radical/dp/0310266300),” about finding his calling in social-justice work, sold more than three hundred thousand copies. “As I crisscross the country, I can feel a new momentum and movement,” Jim Wallis, the editor of *Sojourners* magazine, wrote in the foreword. “The monologue of the religious right is finally over, and a fresh dialogue has begun.”\n\nClaiborne grew up in a conservative Christian household in East Tennessee. In 1993, he moved to Philadelphia, to attend a Christian college, and was shocked by the poverty and homelessness he saw in the city. He became involved with student activism and, in 1995, occupied an abandoned church where homeless families were squatting in order to help keep the church from being knocked down and the families from being displaced. In March, 2003, he travelled to Iraq, to protest the American bombing campaign, and was injured in a car accident during the visit. He has written, “It’s difficult to know where Christianity ends and America begins.”\n\nClaiborne believes that conservative culture often conflates Christianity and nationalism, placing, as he puts it, “the American flag above the cross.” This has long involved aligning religion with American gun culture. Last year, [Wayne LaPierre](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-world-that-wayne-lapierre-and-donald-trump-live-in), the executive vice-president of the National Rifle Association, said, in a speech, that the [Second Amendment](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-las-vegas-massacre-report-and-the-rise-of-second-amendment-nihilism) was not a right “bestowed by man, but granted by God to all Americans as our American birthright.” In 2017, after a shooting at a Southern Baptist church near San Antonio, Texas, left twenty-six people dead and twenty injured, some Christian leaders called for members of their church to arm themselves; Robertson Jeffress, the pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas, said, on “Fox and Friends,” that he felt more secure knowing that his congregants were carrying weapons. After the shooting in San Bernardino, California, in 2015, Jerry Falwell, Jr., the president of Liberty University, urged his students to procure gun permits. (Along with a year-round ski facility, Liberty’s campus is home to a sprawling firing range.) “I’ve always thought that if more good people had concealed-carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walked in,” he [told students](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/12/05/liberty-university-president-if-more-good-people-had-concealed-guns-we-could-end-those-muslims/?utm_term=.09138f8a2576). Claiborne said, “The irony is you can’t have a beer at Liberty, but you can have a gun.”\n\nSome pro-gun Christians argue that scripture supports their claims; many rely on a passage from the Book of Luke in which Jesus says, “Let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one.” This, they argue, is proof that Jesus believed in the use of deadly force. “Some folks would say he was calling on his followers to arm themselves, but that’s definitely misused,” Claiborne told me. He is part of a movement of millennial evangelicals who are trying to separate their faith from the Republican politics of their elders. Claiborne—along with the members of Heeding God’s Call and the Live Free Campaign, which tries to convince congregations to support gun control—believes that living as Jesus did requires renouncing violence. He often quotes a passage from the book of Matthew in which Peter, attempting to defend Jesus against the Romans, pulls out a sword and lops off the ear of a Roman servant. Jesus rebukes him, saying, “For all they who take the sword will perish by the sword.”\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Claiborne, who had cut off his dreads and now wears glasses that frame eyes perpetually widened in glee, took me on a walk to the Shooter Shop. Kensington is an impoverished neighborhood, but Claiborne has been trying to help the community. On our walk, we passed an aquaponic greenhouse that Claiborne had built with the help of a drummer who’d toured with Nine Inch Nails, and an empty lot where construction vehicles were digging the foundation for a recreation center that Claiborne had convinced the city to let a local nonprofit build. We passed under an El station and arrived at the store, which was now shuttered. “Now homeless veterans are living up there,” Claiborne said, pointing to the apartments above the storefront.\n\nSoon after the vigil at the shop, Claiborne had decided to take on the issue of guns full-time. In March, with his friend Michael Martin, a bearded Mennonite and amateur blacksmith, Claiborne published a book called “[Beating Guns](https://www.amazon.com/Beating-Guns-People-Weary-Violence/dp/158743413X),” which discusses the role that white evangelicals play in promoting gun culture. “Forty-one per cent of white evangelicals have guns,” he told me. “The same people who worship the Prince of Peace are packing heat.” Claiborne was planning to drive across the country, along with his wife, Katie Jo, and Martin, in a decommissioned school bus that Katie Jo has refitted into a tiny home with saffron curtains, a composting toilet, and solar panels. They would hold vigils in places riven by mass shootings or drug-related violence, during which they would collect guns and melt them down in a mobile forge. They would invite survivors to help beat the molten metal into hoes and spades—an enactment of a passage from the Book of Isaiah, which advises believers to “beat their swords into plowshares, and spears into pruning hooks.”\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cb9e98c3adeca2db6bf2fb5]||||||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe afternoon before Claiborne left for the trip, I visited him at the pale yellow row house in Kensington where he lives. Outside his home is a large mural—a Banksy replica—of two children standing atop a mountain of defunct weapons. Inside, a purple tandem bike hangs from the ceiling near a painting of Mother Teresa. Katie Jo, who is thirty-six, with a blond braid down her back, had lain awake for the past few nights, trying to account for every square inch of the bus. Claiborne and Martin were now loading it under her watchful eye, shuttling backpacks and boxes from the house out to the porch. At one point, Claiborne disappeared into the basement to fetch some wooden signs that he had made by cutting up old gun advertisements and fashioning them into inspirational words, like “Hope,” “Faith,” and “Love.” He returned with a large stack, and Katie Jo glanced at him with the patience of one accustomed to trying to speak in practical terms to a self-styled visionary. “Oh, no, is all that coming?” she asked. “It ain’t gonna fit on the bus.”\n\nClaiborne moved to Kensington in 1998 and started the Simple Way, a Christian community-service organization that runs a food bank, which distributes four tons of food each week. He was living as a celibate man for religious reasons when, a few years later, he met Katie Jo, a teacher, who had moved to Philadelphia on a one-year mission program. Neither liked the term “missionary”—“It’s more of a short-term, drive-by thing,” Claiborne told me. Katie Jo said, “Our mission isn’t to make people Christians. Our mission is to love people, and if they love Jesus, great!” Kensington, even more than the rest of Philadelphia, has been devastated by the [opioid crisis](https://video.newyorker.com/watch/the-american-opioid-crisis). “Six or seven times, I’ve come home to find people dying on our doorstep,” Katie Jo told me. When she called 911 for help, the first responders often assumed that she was an addict, too. “They always ask, ‘What are you on?’&nbsp;” she said. Outsiders often dismiss Kensington as “Zombieland” because of the number of addicts who live there. “That’s what people thought about Nazareth,” Claiborne said. He quoted a passage from the Gospel of John when a skeptical man asks one of Jesus’ disciples, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” The disciple replies, “Come and See.”\n\nIn recent months, following a major drug bust several blocks away, both the use of heroin and the tempo of shootings in the neighborhood had decreased. “We thought it might have something to do with our presence,” Katie Jo told me, with a self-aware smile. “But then we found out they aren’t putting fentanyl in the heroin so it’s not as strong, and people aren’t buying as much.” In the past few weeks, new dealers had come into the neighborhood to hand out free samples across the street from the Simple Way. Workers worried that the dealers’ presence would scare people in the neighborhood off from reporting violence, and cause shootings to increase again. “Snitch culture is still really strong here,” Miguel Diaz, who helps run the Simple Way’s food bank, told me. “The state can’t afford to move people, or help them if they testify in shootings.”\n\nClaiborne believes that race plays a larger role than religion in influencing white evangelicals’ fondness for guns. According to a Pew study, fifty-seven per cent of white evangelical gun owners cite “protection” as the main reason that they carry firearms; they envision themselves defending their families against criminals, who are often rendered as black or brown inner-city men. According to Claiborne, many evangelicals imagine Jesus in their own image, “as a white, middle-class Republican” who shares their interests and fears. They have bumper stickers that read, “Jesus would still be alive if he’d had an AR-15\\.” In fact, gun violence disproportionately affects people of color, and white Americans are largely insulated from its day-to-day toll, though this may be changing as [school shootings](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/breaking-the-silence-on-gun-violence-in-america) affect suburban communities.\n\nThat evening we drove to Broad Street Ministry, a large Presbyterian church in downtown Philadelphia that serves four hundred and fifty people lunch each day and houses hundreds more each night. When we arrived, paint was flaking from its walls, and the sexton was mopping vomit off of the stoop. Claiborne and Martin were launching their book, and holding a vigil for survivors of gun violence. When the event began, Movita Johnson-Harrell, the first Muslim woman to serve as a state representative in Pennsylvania, told the story of losing her son Charles, in 2011, to a shooter in northwestern Philadelphia who mistook him for someone else. “It is each individual’s responsibility to be part of the solution and not the problem,” she said. “There is no gray area.”\n\nWhen Claiborne took the stand, he brandished what looked like a black leather Bible and then opened the cover to reveal a gun holster. “This is what people are using to carry their guns to church,” he said. Hidden holsters were growing more popular, he told the crowd, as church shootings made Christians think that they needed to protect themselves while at prayer. Then, he began listing gun-violence statistics, in a call-and-response with the audience.\n\n“In America, we make nine and a half million guns a year—twenty-six thousand a day,” he said. “Can I get a ‘Lord have mercy’?”\n\n“Lord have mercy!” the crowd replied.\n\n“A hundred and five people die from guns every day, and thirty-eight thousand a year.”\n\n“Lord have mercy!”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe next morning, before leaving on their trip, Claiborne and Martin kneeled on the sidewalk in Kensington next to their mobile forge, among a pile of guns that they’d collected from neighbors or found in abandoned homes. Martin was sawing an AK-47 in half, and preparing to turn it into a mattock—an old-fashioned hoe with prongs on one side, which is used for breaking up clods of earth. He had grown up in a conservative evangelical church in Colorado. “It was very much God, guns, and country,” he said. But in college he’d decided to return to his family’s Mennonite roots—a tradition that emphasizes nonviolence. With the help of a metalworker in Colorado, he had taught himself the rudiments of blacksmithing. Martin picked up the barrel of the AK-47 with a pair of long steel tongs and placed it into the forge until it softened and glowed a molten red.\n\nClaiborne picked up a microphone. “Come on out, folks,” he called to his neighbors. “If you’re out here and you’ve got guns, we’ll chop them up.”  The crowd of two dozen people who gathered came mostly from Circle of Hope, a network of Christians who do community work in the toughest neighborhoods in Philadelphia and support one another’s “weird progressive Christian activities,” as one member in the crowd put it. Not all share the same opinions about politics, or guns. “I see firearms as a useful tool,” Mark Mumbauer, a thirty-nine-year-old Mennonite and hunter, told me. Once, while leading a discussion among his progressive friends about spiritual warfare, he brought a gun to use as a visual aid, which caused alarm. “I realized it was a terrible idea,” he told me.\n\nP. J. Rainey, a nineteen-year-old wearing a Balenciaga baseball cap and an eyepatch, stood at the edge of the crowd. When Rainey was thirteen, she was shot in the eye with a stray bullet. “At first, I was afraid that no one would ever love me anymore,” she told me. Jonathan Olshefski, a friend of Claiborne’s, had spent the last five years filming a documentary about Rainey’s family’s recording studio, which they ran out of their basement so that local kids could record music. After the shooting, Olshefsky kept filming, and made the incident the focus of the project; the film, “Quest,” premièred at Sundance in 2017. Since then, Rainey has travelled around the country, talking to people about guns. She hadn’t been through formal counselling; she didn’t trust paid professionals to empathize with what she’d gone through, and preferred speaking with small church groups, in cities or small towns affected by gun violence. “It’s my therapy,” she said. When she travelled the country, she was surprised at how backward some of the Midwestern towns seemed. “Their sneakers are always way behind,” she told me.\n\nThe mattock that Martin was making was going to be a gift for Rainey, which she would use in the small garden behind her house. She took a turn striking the molten metal with a hammer and, afterward, turned to address the crowd. She still didn’t know who had shot her; many young men in the neighborhood used her family’s studio, and she thought that some of them must know but were too scared to tell her. She said that she had forgiven the shooter but that she had some ideas for how to hold people accountable in the future. What if each gun were fired before it was sold, and a photo of the bullet’s signature was stored in a database? Then whoever bought and sold the weapon could be traced, she explained.\n\nClaiborne stood at the edge of the gathering in front of a sign that read “Jesus Was Homeless,” listening intently as Rainey spoke. He had called for a similar measure as part of the code that he’d proposed for the Shooter Shop before it closed. “Although it was never our goal to shut down the shop, it’s nice that homeless veterans are now living there,” he said. “I’m reluctant to attribute this to God, but it’s kind of a swords-to-plowshares thing.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cb22bc86f2c9a2449f7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Gun Violence","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"gun-violence"},{"id":"5c2e1c7bb75f002c8941e470","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Gun Control","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"gun-control"},{"id":"5c2e1c7722d4972cd5b83289","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Religion","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"religion"},{"id":"5c2e1c7936cecf40192141cd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Evangelicals","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"evangelicals"},{"id":"5c2e1cba41c92e2c9b85da86","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Philadelphia","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"philadelphia"}],"sections":[{"id":"5ae1c640b4e23f01a4a1192c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Religion","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-religion"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a58b6c4c222f03a82ce6","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Eliza Griswold, a contributing writer covering religion, politics, and the environment, has been writing for *The New Yorker* since 2003.

Pills and steroid injections hadn’t eased their pain. They were scared of surgery. So, one afternoon last October, two dozen men and women, many of them white-haired, some leaning on canes, shuffled into a meeting room at Robson Ranch, a luxury retirement community in Denton, Texas. Sipping iced tea and clutching brochures that promised a pain-free tomorrow, they checked off their ailments on a questionnaire.\n\nThey were there to see a presentation by David Greene, who was introduced as a “retired orthopedic surgeon.” Atlas Medical Center, a local clinic that specializes in pain treatment, hosted the event. Greene, a short, trim man with his hair slicked up, ignored the stage and microphone and stood close to his audience. After warming up the crowd with a joke about his inept golf skills, Greene launched into his sales pitch. A tiny vial no larger than the palm of his hand, he told the group, contains roughly ten million live stem cells, harvested from the placenta, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord, or amnion, the membrane that surrounds the fetus in the womb. Injected into a joint or spine, or delivered intravenously into the bloodstream, Greene told his listeners, those cells could ease whatever ailed them.\n\nOn a screen behind him, Greene displayed a densely printed slide with a “small list” of conditions his stem-cell product could treat: arthritis, tendinitis, psoriasis, lupus, hair loss, facial wrinkles, scarring, erectile dysfunction, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, emphysema, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, ALS, neuropathy, pelvic pain, diabetes, dry eye, macular degeneration, kidney failure. And that was just a sample. “I need to add a couple more slides,” Greene said with a laugh.\n\nGreene said that amniotic stem cells derive their healing power from an ability to develop into any kind of tissue, but he failed to mention that mainstream science does not support his claims. He also did not disclose that he lost his license to practice medicine in 2009, after surgeries he botched resulted in several deaths. Instead, he offered glowing statistics: amniotic stem cells could help the heart beat better, “on average by twenty per cent,” he said. “Over eighty-five per cent of patients benefit exceptionally from the treatment.”\n\n“Patients come back to the center saying, ‘I can walk farther, I can breathe easier, I can sleep better,’&nbsp;” he proclaimed. “It’s remarkable, the outcomes we’ve been seeing for the last few years.” In the second row, a slender woman in a striped jacket, who had hobbled into the meeting on a wooden cane, pumped her fists in the air. “Stem cells!” she cheered.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nFor more than half a century, the regenerative possibilities of stem cells—which the body stores to repair damaged tissue and organs and restore blood supply—have tantalized the medical community. Bone-marrow transplants for cancer patients, which rely on blood stem cells, fulfill this potential. But alongside legitimate, scientifically proven treatments, an industry has sprung up in which specialized clinics offer miracle remedies from poorly understood stem-cell products. \n\nThese clinics are multiplying in the United States. According to a tally by Leigh Turner, an associate professor of bioethics at the University of Minnesota, there were twelve such clinics advertising to consumers in 2009; in 2017, there were more than [seven hundred](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29805145). Unproven cellular therapies are a two-billion-dollar global business, according to a [recent paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30316562) co-authored by Massimo Dominici, the lead investigator at the cellular therapy lab at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, in Italy.\n\nThis burgeoning business is largely unregulated. Technically, manufacturers are required to submit stem-cell therapies for review as a drug, and to provide evidence of their safety and efficacy, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasn’t enforced the rule consistently. The former F.D.A. commissioner Scott Gottlieb acknowledged in an interview that the agency’s laissez-faire attitude has made it easier for stem-cell clinics to proliferate. “This is an example where the F.D.A., for a long period of time, took enforcement discretion, then the field grew,” he said. “Then it becomes hard to step in and actually apply the regulation.”\n\nMany clinics offer stem cells taken from a patient’s own bone marrow or fat. But they’re being challenged by a newer technology: amniotic stem cells. \n\nGreene’s company, R3 Stem Cell, was established in 2013\\. It distributes amniotic stem cells to about thirty clinics nationwide, which have administered them to ten thousand patients, according to an R3 brochure. It also handles marketing for the clinics. In an interview, Greene acknowledged that the benefits of amniotic stem cells that he touted  at the Robson Ranch seminar are based on “a lot of success stories,” rather than on clinical trials. “I don’t claim anything,” he added. “I don’t claim that this is a treatment. I don’t claim that it cures anything. I don’t claim that it’s a permanent fix. All I discuss is maybe, potentially, people can get some improvements from stem-cell care.”\n\nOne appeal of amniotic stem-cell treatments is convenience. They don’t require patients to undergo liposuction or bone-marrow extraction; instead, manufacturers harvest the cells from tissues donated by women who have recently given birth, and the cells are then frozen and shipped to clinics. There is no special training needed to administer amniotic treatments, either—a nurse practitioner on staff can give injections—so chiropractors, beauticians, and sports-medicine doctors can enter the field with relative ease. A procedure such as an injection into a joint might take about ten minutes and cost between five and ten thousand dollars. For systemic diseases, such as lupus, some clinics also administer the cells intravenously, which can cost more than ten thousand dollars per session.\n\nBecause amniotic-stem-cell treatments don’t undergo the clinical trials required for F.D.A. approval, there’s little data or research on them. Their efficacy is highly questionable and, in one case where bacteria contaminated the supply, the lack of accountability in the industry has led to serious infections for a dozen patients. An investigation by ProPublica and *The New Yorker* found disgraced doctors who were recast as salespeople, manufacturers that cloaked themselves in pseudo-science and had few scientists on staff, and clinics that offer to treat conditions like multiple sclerosis or kidney disease without specialized training. Unscientific methods, deceptive marketing, price gouging, and disregard for patients’ well-being were rampant across the amniotic-stem-cell-therapy industry.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe supply chain for amniotic therapy starts and finishes with people who are at vulnerable times in their lives: the cells come from new mothers, and go to chronically ill patients. Women who undergo cesarean sections are often asked to donate their birth tissue shortly before the procedure. By law, they cannot be compensated for it. Mothers who donated their tissue told ProPublica and *The New Yorker* that they assumed, or were assured, that it would be used for a worthy cause—and that, otherwise, it would be disposed of as medical waste. But they could not recall the details of the donation process, owing to the haze of childbirth. “Someone walked in with a form while I was in labor and asked if I wanted to donate” the umbilical cord, Julie Menge, who gave birth in Pittsburgh in 2015, said. “I said, ‘Sure!’ And I have no idea what happened to it.”\n\nTissue banks do collect birth tissue for important medical reasons. For instance, blood stem cells from umbilical cords can be used in the treatment of some blood disorders, such as leukemia. Placentas can be turned into wound dressings, including surgical grafts and bandages for people who have had ocular surgery. Other donations, though, find their way to commercial amniotic-stem-cell manufacturers, which sell them at a steep markup.\n\nThe patients are taking an expensive gamble. A sixty-six-year-old insurance-auditing specialist, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons, suffered constant pain from arthritis in both knees, but wanted to avoid replacement surgery. After attending a seminar in Irving, Texas, hosted—like the one at Robson Ranch—by Atlas Medical Center, she booked an appointment at Atlas in November, 2017\\.\n\nThere, the staff told her that the supplier was offering a discount that would lower her cost to seventy-three hundred dollars, for injections in both knees. “They were just acting so shocked, one of them said, ‘I’ve never seen a discount this high before,’ ” she recalled. “I was so gullible.” She received an injection in each knee, and returned every two months for a checkup. “They had me fill out this form every time to record my pain level, and it was close to ten every time,” she said. The staff assured her that she would improve within six months, but her knees did not get better.\n\nAlexandra Schnee, a chiropractor from Atlas who introduced Greene at the Robson Ranch event, defended the treatment. “As with any procedure, there will be patients who have success and others that don’t,” she said in an e-mail. “We have many more patients who have experienced improvement with this therapy.” The patient cancelled her last appointment. “After six months, I was pretty ticked off,” she said.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nWhen most people hear the words “stem cell,” the first thing that often comes to mind is embryos. Embryonic stem cells are truly wondrous: they can evolve into all types of cells in the body. But their power is fleeting. By the time a fetus is fully formed, its stem cells are stratified: blood-forming stem cells can make both white and red blood cells, for example, but they won’t naturally turn into skin. Skin stem cells can regenerate the various layers of skin, but they won’t give rise to a new brain cell. Only in a lab, with  genetic modifications, can scientists get differentiated stem cells to regain embryonic capabilities.\n\nAmniotic-stem-cell products are made solely from tissues related to childbirth, not from embryonic cells. The scientific consensus is that they may be able to turn into a limited range of tissue types—namely bone, fat, and cartilage—but they can’t turn into liver, heart, or brain cells, for example. Even if such a transformation were possible, scientists don’t know how it could happen or what would trigger it. Until this regenerative capacity is proved, some researchers say, these birth-tissue cells shouldn’t be called stem cells at all.\n\nYet providers of amniotic-stem-cell treatments often attribute to their products all the powers of embryonic stem cells, minus the ethical issues associated with deriving cells from early-stage embryos. In his talk at Robson Ranch, Greene blurred the distinction between embryonic and amniotic stem cells, saying, “I think of a stem cell as a blank slate, a master cell that has not made the decision of what it wants to specialize in.” The cells he markets “can turn into anything we clinically need them to become,” he said.\n\nThat assertion is “simply not true,” Jeanne Loring, the director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine at the Scripps Research Institute and the chief scientific officer at Aspen Neuroscience, said. “If a stem cell from one organ is put into another, like a placenta or umbilical-cord cell into a knee, it will die. It can’t become something else.”\n\nGreene acknowledged that most patients don’t understand the difference between embryonic and other types of stem cells, and that the language he uses in his seminars is largely guided by market research. “When you look at what people are typing on the Web, ‘stem cell’ is the No. 1 key phrase,” he told me. “That is the key word that the public in America understands.” \n\nGreene later cited a 2017 paper from a Chilean study as evidence that amniotic stem cells could help patients with heart failure. In the trial, fifteen patients received umbilical-cord-derived cells and saw improvement in the amount of blood pumped with each heartbeat. Steven Nissen, the chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, reviewed the study at ProPublica and *The New Yorker’s* request, and noted that the trial was “tiny” and “is so preliminary (and frankly limited in quality) that no conclusions are possible.” He added that the Chilean findings had not been reproduced, while other studies had been negative. “This is NOT a justification for commercial administration of stem cells,” he said.\n\nAt the Robson Ranch seminar, Schnee, the Atlas chiropractor, played a news clip about a two-part study at Stanford and the University of Pittsburgh in which stem cells were used to treat stroke patients. It showed a woman who had lost much of her limb function raising her arm above her head with a look of awe. But the cells used in the Stanford trial—which the clip referred to as “modified adult stem cells”—weren’t taken from amniotic tissue. Instead, the study used bone-marrow cells that had been cultivated in a lab, genetically modified to be more potent, and then delivered with a needle into a precisely selected spot in the brain.\n\nGary Steinberg, the chair of neurosurgery at Stanford University, ran the trials and has been developing stem-cell therapies for stroke patients for two decades. When he was told how the clip about his study was used, he said that there is no evidence to show that products made from amniotic cells are beneficial.“I have no control over how these clips get used, unfortunately,” Steinberg said. “I’m not happy about it.” He added, “I’m an advocate for thoughtful, controlled trials, and they will never know, unless we do controlled trials, if it works.”\n\nSteinberg isn’t the only academic whose work has been distorted to promote Greene’s products. A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQQQpvjw3Sk&feature=youtu.be&t=2m29s) on Youtube by R3 Stem Cell includes clips of David Schaffer, the director of the Stem Cell Center at the University of California, Berkeley, talking about regenerative medicine. Schaffer told ProPublica and *The New Yorker* that he has never heard of R3 and does not work with amniotic tissue. “That footage was not included with my consent,” he said. “I would be suspicious of the business.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nGreene’s main supplier is the Utah Cord Bank, in Sandy, Utah, which was established in 2005 as a private facility where customers paid to store umbilical-cord blood and other birth tissue taken from their babies to be used, among other reasons, if the child or a sibling had a blood disorder. For years, the bank’s Web site boasted of “bottom line prices,” advertising the “lowest yearly storage fee in the nation.”\n\nAround 2016, the bank began making two amniotic-stem-cell products, called StemShot and StemVive. (StemShot was later renamed Stemii.) Although the bank continued to store birth tissue, amniotic stem cells soon became its biggest moneymaker.\n\nThe Utah Cord Bank was co-founded by a man named Eliott Spencer, who holds a doctorate in biochemistry from Brigham Young University. When the bank started producing StemShot and StemVive, Spencer was the only scientist on the company’s management team and the only person who knew the recipe for making the products, according to two former employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Spencer said in an e-mail that the bank now has “more than one scientist and many technicians, as well as multiple people who know how to safely procure, process, and package our products.”\n\nSpencer said that he and his wife, Carlee, “currently work side by side as co-founders and presidents of the company.” According to her LinkedIn page, Carlee has a degree in design graphics. A former volunteer youth religion teacher, she originally joined Spencer’s company as a lab-support worker and, the next year, rose to executive vice-president and director of procurement. The bank’s chief executive officer, Leigh Kimball, says on his LinkedIn page that the company makes “100% organic stem cells” and is “on track to double in size in 2019 to $20M.” He has a bachelor’s degree in journalism.\n\nFriends and former employees described Spencer as a computer whiz who mined bitcoin in his spare time. They also portrayed him as a libertarian who dislikes government regulation and who can be thrifty to a fault. Last November, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief after trying to exit an airport parking lot without paying an eighteen-dollar parking fee. According to a [court filing](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5982405-Eliott-Spencer-Docket.html), he caused $3,755 worth of damage to the parking-lot gate, which he agreed to pay for. He said in his e-mail that he doesn’t believe he was responsible for the damage and that the incident “is in no way indicative of major flaws in my character.”\n\nIndustry insiders and the two former employees said that one placenta should yield between two and four hundred vials of amniotic stem cells. The Utah Cord Bank would harvest as many as eight hundred, the ex-employees said. Also according to the former employees, it costs less than fifty dollars to make a single vial, which is then sold to a clinic or a distributor for about a thousand dollars.\n\nSpencer also used expired chemicals and reagents in his lab, according to two former employees. In January, 2018, the F.D.A. sent an inspector to the Utah Cord Bank to audit it for compliance with regulations on laboratory operations, according to the FDAzilla database, which tracks inspections. After the inspector notified the company that she would arrive on a Monday, workers spent the previous weekend  getting rid of expired materials, two former employees said. In a statement to *The New Yorker*, Spencer denied ever using expired chemicals or reagents in his lab. The bank passed the audit.\n\nSpencer said that the Utah Cord Bank has a perfect safety record and has never been cited for deficiencies by the F.D.A. “With tens of thousands of treatments shipped worldwide, and with no serious adverse events reported, U.C.B. has helped a lot of people overcome their health challenges,” he said. “Sadly, this cannot be said for so many others in this space.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOn its Web site, the Utah Cord Bank touts its products as containing “young multipotent cells” that can turn into many kinds of tissue. It and other manufacturers typically ship amniotic stem cells cryogenically preserved to a doctor’s office, where they’re thawed before they are injected into a patient. But, despite the effort to preserve the cells, research suggests that many of them do not survive. Dead cells, once injected, have no effect; the body’s immune system breaks them down.\n\n“For most of these products, there’s not many healthy cells left,” Daniel Kuebler, the dean of the School of Natural and Applied Sciences at Franciscan University of Steubenville, Ohio, said. Kuebler has tested amniotic products for manufacturers including the Utah Cord Bank, but he declined to comment on any specific product, saying that his contracts bound him to confidentiality. Even if there are some cells that are still alive post-thaw, “I have a hard time getting them to grow,” Kuebler said. “Just because they’re alive doesn’t mean they’re not in the process of dying.”\n\nLisa Fortier, a researcher at Cornell University and a consultant for a company that sells birth-tissue products, [tested](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5982402-Fortier-Proteomic-Analysis-and-Cell-Viability-of.html) nine of them from four manufacturers—Utah Cord Bank was not one of them—and also found no live cells. It is “very unlikely” that the amniotic membrane “works as a stem-cell product,” she said. Fortier and Kuebler said that there may be other proteins in the products that could somehow wake up the immune system or restore tissue, which might account for the benefits reported by some patients, but there’s not enough data to know for sure.\n\nGreene supplied ProPublica and *The New Yorker* with two lab analyses of Utah Cord Bank products. Both showed that up to forty-two per cent of the cells in the tested vials were alive. One analysis, done by Kuebler, counted roughly six hundred thousand live cells in the vial. That’s far less than the ten million live stem cells that Greene cited at the seminar. The testing also didn’t indicate whether the living cells were stem cells or another type of tissue. “There’s a good chance most of these cells are not stem cells,” Paul Knoepfler, a professor of cell biology and human anatomy at the University of California, Davis, said, after reviewing the reports sent by Greene. “The majority could be fibroblasts”—connective-tissue cells—“or other unhelpful cells.”\n\nIn its advertising, the cord bank features employee testimonials about the excellence of its products. Eliott Spencer said that “nearly all” of the bank’s employees “have used our products to treat shoulder pain, knee pain, and more,” and have “experienced the benefits.” The two former Utah Cord Bank employees described “shoot-up parties” where the staff were given vials of the product for personal use. According to one former employee, Spencer’s brother “would come in and do IV pushes on people.” In a statement to *The New Yorker*, Spencer denied that “shoot-up parties” had taken place. Utah Cord Bank later further denied any “unauthorized or unsafe IV treatment” by his brother. The other former employee said that he became concerned about Spencer’s secretive production methods and worried that the amniotic cells weren’t being properly tested for disease. He said he’d take his dose to the bathroom and trash it.  \n \n-=-=-=-\n\nOn an overcast day in November, 2017, a ninety-year-old man named Norman Graf, one of twenty-seven million Americans who suffer from arthritis, attended a seminar at the Holiday Inn in Bismarck, North Dakota, hosted by West2North Medical Solutions. West2North is not part of Greene’s network, but it is also supplied by the Utah Cord Bank. Dean Jones, a chiropractor who co-owns West2North, assured the audience at the seminar that amniotic stem cells alleviate arthritic pain. Graf later told his daughter, Libby Graf, that he had planned to go home and think about a stem-cell injection, but the clinic’s staff convinced him to have it done immediately.\n\n“He was telling me he went and got an injection for fifty-four hundred dollars and I was, like, What?” Libby recounted. Her father’s cognitive abilities have diminished with age, and “it’s obvious that he doesn’t have enough wherewithal to make this decision,” she said.\n\nJones said in an e-mail that, while confidentiality prevents him from commenting on specific patients, the clinic “does not ‘convince’ anyone to do a procedure immediately. We fully explain the different options and benefits, and allow the patient to decide.” All patients sign consent forms and are told there’s no guarantee that the therapy will help them, Jones said.\n\nGraf told his daughter that his condition hadn’t improved. Yet he was planning to go back, because the clinic had promised him a discount—to thirty-six hundred dollars—for a second shot. Libby persuaded him not to go. Graf’s other daughter, Jodi Jacobson, complained to the North Dakota attorney general, as did other patients, prompting a state investigation. In May, West2North [agreed](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4952167-AVC-NDSC-Executed.html) to repay $19,733 to Graf and three other patients, and to be “permanently enjoined from engaging in any stem cell injections” that don’t comply with F.D.A. rules, but denied any violation of state law. \n\nSpencer said that the Utah Cord Bank was contacted by the North Dakota attorney general about one physician but wasn’t a target of the investigation. “We have been burdened and troubled by claims made by some physicians that use our products,” he said.\n\nWest2North couldn’t stay away from the lucrative stem-cell market. As of February, 2019, the clinic’s Web site said, “Bone marrow stem cells coming soon.” Jones said that the state attorney general has been informed of this plan and hasn’t objected. North Dakota is still reviewing the matter, according to assistant attorney general, Parrell Grossman. “We have approved nothing,” he said.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nJones faced tougher regulation from the state of North Dakota than he did from the F.D.A. Nearly fifteen years ago, the F.D.A. established rules on the use of human tissue. If the tissue was “minimally manipulated” and used in the same way it originally functioned in the body, it didn’t need F.D.A. approval as a drug. However, if the cells were modified in a lab, or were given a new purpose—such as using placenta cells to treat a brain disease—they would be considered a drug, and would have to undergo F.D.A. review.\n\nThe problem is that the agency left it up to manufacturers to decide which group their products belonged to. Seeking F.D.A. approval entails running multiple human trials, which can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There was no incentive for the stem-cell manufacturers to put their treatments through this process, so they took the position that their products didn’t count as drugs.\n\nThe F.D.A. rarely disagreed with their stance. From 2010 to 2017, the agency sent warning letters to only seven of the hundreds of companies that made or marketed stem-cell treatments, according to a tally of letters in the F.D.A. database. The agency said it could not confirm the exact number because it “does not maintain lists of actions by product.”\n\nIn the early twenty-tens, the agency decided it should issue stricter guidelines on the use of human tissue. But it wasn’t until November, 2017, that the [guidelines](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/CellularandGeneTherapy/UCM585403.pdf) were updated, clarifying that many tissue products, including amniotic stem cells, must be characterized as drugs. The F.D.A. gave the clinics another three years—until 2020—to comply. (In the meantime, the agency continues to send warning letters to more companies.)\n\nGottlieb, the former F.D.A. commissioner, said he is disappointed that, during this interim period, few firms have submitted their products to the F.D.A. for approval as drugs. “There are literally hundreds of clinics, and some of them are engaging in very risky actions,” he said. “They’re crossing the line.”\n\nGottlieb acknowledged that the agency doesn’t have the resources to go after them all at once. He said that the F.D.A. will prioritize the clinics that offer the riskiest procedures, such as injections into the eye and spinal cord. On March 5th, a few weeks after our interview, Gottlieb announced his resignation. It’s not clear yet if his successor will maintain his commitment to cracking down on the stem-cell industry.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nGreene, who is fifty, travels the country to deliver seminars, drawing in patients with his friendly patter. His Web site, R3stemcell.com, connects patients to clinics, referred to as “Centers of Excellence,” that have signed contracts with him. Greene enlists doctors at those clinics to offer amniotic-stem-cell treatments. The clinics pay Greene at least four hundred and ninety-five dollars to join his network, another four hundred and ninety-five dollars per month, and seventy-five dollars for each prospective patient that comes to them through his Web site, according to a brochure. \n\nGreene regularly holds training sessions in Las Vegas for potential providers. On another R3 Web site, eight “top providers and industry thought leaders” are listed as trainers. They included a “Functional Oriental Medicine Expert” who doesn’t have a medical degree, a “biologics expert” who is the president of a surgical-supplies consulting company and has no scientific training, and a pain doctor who was once disciplined by the Texas Medical Board for inadequate care of two patients who received spinal-cord stimulators.\n\nAmong the most recent doctors to join Greene’s network is Prabhat Soni, who runs a private practice out of a town house in Brooklyn, New York. In the clinic’s waiting area, banners advertise the “O-shot” and “P-shot” for erectile dysfunction, promising to “rejuvenate your sex life and your marriage.” Another banner, which carries Greene’s logo, advertises “cosmetic stem cell therapies: effective regenerative procedures for facelift, hair restoration and scar improvement!”\n\nSoni told me that he has been offering procedures using fat stem cells for about a decade. He joined Greene’s network, at the end of 2018, because amniotic treatments were a better value proposition, he said. “For fat cells, you have to numb the patient, do the liposuction to take fat, and then process the fat. It can take three hours. For amniotic cells, you just take the vial between your hands and warm it up, then you can go. It takes ten minutes.” Either way, Soni charges five thousand dollars for one injection and ten thousand dollars for intravenous treatment.\n\nHe told me that he sees patients for stem-cell treatments about once a day, and that stem cells can work for any ailment known to mankind. “They do everything,” he said, “because stem cells are our friend.” When asked why they hadn’t replaced all other medicines, Soni blamed a conspiracy by the pharmaceutical industry, saying, “because then the pharmaceutical companies will die.” \n\nSoni put me in touch with Joseph Longo, a seventy-two-year-old who developed arthritis in his knees after decades of working as a ballroom dancer and instructor. Last December, Longo paid Soni twelve thousand dollars for two injections, one in each knee. When he woke up the next morning, he said, he felt “a little different. Not so stiff, not so much pain.” When we met, two months later, Longo was limping slightly, but said that his left knee continued to feel somewhat better. Soni told Longo that three more injections were required for him to feel a significant difference, but, by early May, Longo had decided not to seek further treatment, saying that his left knee hadn’t improved any more. “I don’t think the regenerative properties were happening,” Longo said.\n\nEarlier this year, Soni’s Web site displayed the names and faces of a team of clinicians, including a cardiologist, a cosmetologist, a neurologist, and a urologist. None of them were listed on New York State’s license look-up page, and their photos were traced back to stock-photo Web sites. When initially asked about these specialists, Soni said, “They are all seeing patients for me,” and changed the subject. After ProPublica and *The New Yorker* expressed doubts about the clinicians’ existence to Soni, the names and photos vanished from the Web site. \n\nIn a biography on his Web site, Soni said that he is an assistant clinical professor at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. When asked if he was still affiliated with the hospital, Soni said he was in the pulmonary division, asserting, inaccurately,  “I’m the chief of department.”\n\nThe hospital said that Soni’s assistant professorship ended in December, 2017, and he no longer has a position there. After ProPublica and *The New Yorker* questioned him, Soni updated his Web site to reflect that he no longer works at the hospital. Greene said that he dropped the doctor from the R3 network. Soni expressed confidence that his stem-cell practice is poised to grow. “Someday I will be on TV,” he said. “So many people will come.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nFor some patients, stem-cell treatments have been disastrous. Last July, Dorothy O’Connell, an eighty-nine-year-old grandmother living in Brazoria, Texas, went to see Sammy Tao, a chiropractor offering stem-cell therapy. She had read about him in a newspaper piece by Gin Crawford, a local columnist who, when not sharing recipes for strawberry sheet cakes or tips for opening pickle jars, regularly extolled amniotic-stem-cell treatments and recommended Tao’s clinic as a local option for her readers.  \n\nTao assured O’Connell that stem cells could help her arthritic shoulders and back, O’Connell’s daughter Elaine Dilley, who took her to the appointment, said. “He told her that her life would change, that she could go back to being herself again,” Dilley recalled. That prospect seemed worth the $12,250 price.\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n[#image: /photos/5cd169a25b65a32ea26f5bf4]||||||\n+++\n\nOn August 9th, a nurse practitioner at the clinic injected stem cells in both of O’Connell’s shoulders, according to her daughter and court documents. The following month, O’Connell returned for injections in her spine. Three days later, she called the clinic complaining of severe back pain and muscle spasms. Omar Vidal, a pain-management physician who worked with Tao, prescribed a muscle relaxant and Tylenol. \n\nTao had said that O’Connell might feel under the weather for a few days. But she kept getting worse. “I was scared I was hurting her when I moved her because, every time you would touch her, she would scream, she was in so much pain,” Dilley said. Finally, Dilley called an ambulance. The local hospital had her mother flown to Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center in Houston, because blood tests showed that she had sepsis. O’Connell’s kidneys were failing and her body was shutting down.\n\nAmniotic stem cells are unlikely to cause major complications if they’re clean, but the ones injected into O’Connell were contaminated with bacteria, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The product Tao’s team used was made from umbilical-cord blood and came from a privately held distributor in California, called Liveyon. At least [eleven other patients](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/pdfs/mm6750a5-H.pdf) across Texas, Florida, and Arizona were also infected with various strains of bacteria, including *e. Coli* and *e. Cloacae*, and hospitalized after being treated with contaminated cells from Liveyon. Under pressure from the F.D.A., Liveyon recalled the product.\n\nLiveyon’s ads feature a dignified-looking doctor with graying hair and piercing blue eyes, telling patients about the benefits of stem cells. He shows one woman a glowing blue vial, and a narrator declares that the stem cells will provide “a new standard of living, free of pain and limitation.”\n\nThe doctor is Alan Gaveck, the company’s director of education. Gaveck used to work as a podiatrist, in Arizona, but, in 2007, the state’s medical board put him on probation, after he bungled a foot surgery and the patient had to have a toe amputated. “I felt horrible at the time and still do to this day that the patient suffered such a loss,” Gaveck said. He acknowledged that he is not trained in stem-cell biology. His “relevant experience,” he said, “has been learned through eight years of being immersed in the industry and daily reading of journal articles related to regenerative medicine.”\n\nLiveyon’s founder and chief executive officer, John Kosolcharoen, pleaded guilty in 2016 to [paying](https://www.ocregister.com/2016/06/23/seven-from-oc-arrested-in-nationwide-health-fraud-sweep/) illegal kickbacks as part of a scheme to steer prescriptions for military members covered by *TRICARE*{:.small}, the U.S. military’s health-care program, to specific pharmacies. He is awaiting sentencing.\n\nKosolcharoen readily acknowledged the felony conviction, saying that he got tripped up by a change in the law. He blamed the contaminated stem cells on his supplier, a San Diego-based manufacturer called [Genetech](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/health/stem-cell-shots-bacteria-fda.html). Once the F.D.A. contacted Liveyon, it immediately cut ties with Genetech, he said. Genetech’s president, Edwin Pinos, could not be reached. His company’s San Diego office has been closed. \n\nO’Connell spent two weeks at St. Luke’s, and five more in a rehabilitation center. “My mother used to be able to wash her car, mow the yard, cook,” Dilley said. “Now she can barely get down the steps.” O’Connell has a lawsuit against Liveyon, Genetech, Vidal, and Tao pending in a Texas district court. Tao and Vidal denied all allegations in court filings and said that they weren’t responsible for O’Connell’s injuries. Tao’s lawyer declined to comment, and Vidal didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nCrawford, the local newspaper columnist, said she was upset to hear of O’Connell’s infection. “I’ve been sick about this whole thing,” she said. “My whole intent was to help people, not harm people.” In a March column, Crawford told her readers that she no longer recommends Tao’s clinic. \n\nNow Liveyon is making its own product, from umbilical cords that it buys from a public cord bank, Kosolcharoen said. The bank, which he declined to identify, sells donated cords that don’t meet F.D.A. standards for treatment of blood disorders, he said. Liveyon, he noted, uses them for a different purpose—to create stem cell products. He called the new treatment “clinical trial grade” and said that Liveyon plans to start trials to prove its safety and benefits. But, even before conducting trials, Liveyon is already marketing the product, which it calls Pure, with the tagline “The Pure Feeling of Healing.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn his talk at Robson Ranch, Greene assured his listeners that the F.D.A. supports regenerative medicine. “They’ve realized that there are clinical uses now,” he said. He also warned against what he called “end-game surgery,” telling his audience, “You can’t go back from a spinal fusion or knee replacement.”\n\nGreene knows firsthand how dangerous surgery can be. After earning his bachelor’s and medical degrees, at the University of Virginia, Greene began working as an orthopedic surgeon, in Arizona, in 2004\\. By 2007, he was earning more than four hundred thousand dollars a year, but the outcomes of his surgeries were dire. From 2005 to 2007, he botched at least a dozen of them, the Arizona Medical Board later found.\n\nIn April, 2005, a thirty-five-year-old U.S. Air Force master sergeant, James DeJong, came to Greene complaining of back pain, according to court filings. DeJong left Greene’s operating room as a paraplegic. “I wouldn’t buy a bottle of water from him if I was lost in the Sahara Desert,” DeJong said in a recent e-mail.\n\nIn January, 2006, Greene operated on the seventy-eight-year-old Lola Ollerton for what was supposed to be a routine surgery. Her five daughters sat in the waiting room with their father, joking and “talking about history, about when our parents started dating,” until they were called into a conference room, one of Ollerton’s daughters, Peggy Archuleta, said. Greene then told them that “there was a complication,” another daughter, Susan Fuller, recounted. “He then said that she had died. My eldest sister, Pam, said—and I will never forget this—‘You mean to tell me that our mother’s death was a complication?’&nbsp;” Besides her husband and daughters, Ollerton left behind twenty-eight grandchildren and forty-six great-grandchildren.\n\nFour more of Greene’s patients died in that two-year period. Others suffered from infections, meningitis, excessive bleeding, and permanent injuries, such as a dropped foot. Alarmed by the “sheer volume of cases” and Greene’s “continued insistence that he made no mistakes in the care of his patients,” the Arizona Medical Board [revoked his license](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4951351-db523e6e-b394-4357-884f-2675805864c4.html) in 2009\\.\n\nInundated with fourteen malpractice lawsuits, Greene filed for bankruptcy that year. His insurance settled most of the cases. The Ollerton family received a six-figure settlement, the filings show.\n\nGreene said he had “great outcomes” as a surgeon and the same rate of complications as other doctors who haven’t been sanctioned. He also said that he settled the lawsuits because he couldn’t afford to fight them in court. “I had a disagreement with the medical board that went on, and I ran out of money.” Greene said that several board-certified doctors testified on his behalf, and these incidents are not relevant to his work today.\n\nHe defended his continuing use of the honorific “Dr.,” likening himself to a television personality. “Well, what about Dr. Phil?” he asked. The loss of his license, he said, “doesn’t take away the fact that I did a fellowship and a six-, seven-year residency … But I just hate that we’re even talking about this, because I’ve been through it, all these malpractice things, but, you know, my life is very, very different now.” He asserted that none of the stem-cell patients in his network have suffered major complications from their treatments.\n\nAfter the lawsuits, Greene returned to school, and got an M.B.A. at Arizona State University. Then he launched his second act, in stem cells. He was banned from practicing medicine, but he could still profit from it.\n\nSchnee, the chiropractor who introduced Greene at Robson Ranch, said that she was unaware of Greene’s disciplinary record when he spoke there. After learning of it from ProPublica and *The New Yorker*, Atlas cancelled all seminars with him, she said. \n\nPeggy Archuleta, whose mother died in Greene’s operating room, was quiet on the phone as she heard about his new business. “I hope he is remorseful, and he’s taking decent care of people in some other line of work,” she said. “But if he’s not changed, if he still disregards the truth and is harming people, then he needs to be stopped. Someone needs to stop him again.”\n\n*This story has been updated to clarify the circumstances under which Liveyon says it buys umbilical cords from a public cord bank. In a call with *The New Yorker* prior to the publication of this piece, Eliott Spencer denied using expired chemicals and reagents in his lab. He further denied the existence of “shoot-up parties” as described in the piece. Due to an error by The New Yorker, these denials were omitted in the original version of this piece. Utah Cord Bank was not asked whether Spencer’s brother performed IV pushes; the Cord Bank subsequently addressed this.*\n\n*Jess Ramirez, Katie Zavadski, and Alex Mierjeski contributed reporting and research to this article*.\n\n*ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.

certain anniversaries teeter between the emblematic and the problematic. On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping stood in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, one of the most consequential social protests in Chinese history, in which students agitated against the incompetence of the country’s authoritarian leaders. Xi told “China’s youth” today to love their motherland, and to “obey the party and follow the Party.” He also urged them to study the May Fourth Movement, and added that “those who are unpatriotic, who would even go so far as to cheat and betray the motherland, are a disgrace in the eyes of their own country and the whole world.”\n\nXi was taking a risk: the legacy of the May Fourth Movement is a complicated one, and to study its history is to confront the central hypocrisy of the Communist Party. The May Fourth Movement grew out of frustration with foreign aggression and the failure of the government to protect its citizens and its territory. On May 4, 1919, students from Peking University took to the streets to denounce the Treaty of Versailles, which allowed Japan to occupy the former German Concession in the coastal province of Shandong, territory that had been held by the German Empire prior to the First World War, instead of ceding control of it to China. More important, the leaders of the movement declared their ambition to make the country anew: to dismantle the bureaucracies, topple the hierarchies, and emancipate China from its feudal roots. They were joined by thousands of students from other universities, and marched to Tiananmen Square. There was some rioting, and a number of students were beaten and arrested, as the protests spread to other cities, but, after a general strike was called in June, they were released. Their actions are often credited with ushering China into the modern era.\n\nThe night before the protests, as students assembled in a lecture hall, one of them brandished a knife and declared that he’d rather cut his own throat than endure the pain of witnessing China’s humiliation. But no one embodied the revolutionary fervor more than Chen Duxiu, a dean at the university, who joined a Marxist study group there and published a journal, called *New Youth*, in which he wrote, “I, with tears, place my plea before the fresh and vital youth, in the hope that they will achieve self-awareness and begin to struggle. What is this self-awareness? It is to be conscious of the value and possibility of one’s young life.” Chen devoted an issue of the journal to a Marxist critique of Chinese society that gained widespread attention and, several months after the protests, he was forced to resign from the university. He was jailed for three months for distributing inciteful literature, and, after his release, moved to the French Concession in Shanghai. Two years later, he became a co-founder of the Communist Party.\n\nIt’s a matter of some inconvenience for present-day leaders that the Party so quickly became the kind of dictatorial, bureaucratic behemoth that its founders had tried to banish, and that so much of its history betrayed its original principles—during the [Tiananmen Square student protests](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/china-1989-tiananmen-square-protests-demonstration-massacre) of 1989, which coincided with the seventieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, troops fired on crowds of civilians, killing hundreds, [perhaps thousands](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-42465516), and thousands more were arrested. And, although Xi has made a show of officially embracing the spirit of May 4th, universities are once again the focus of a crackdown. In March, the prestigious Tsinghua University, whose students had marched in 1919, [suspended Xu Zhangrun](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/world/asia/chinese-law-professor-xi.html), a law professor who had published a series of essays denouncing Xi’s authoritarian tendencies. They are the kind of work that would have found a home in *New Youth* a hundred years ago. \n\nThen, earlier this week, six Peking University students disappeared, and are [believed to have been detained](https://www.ft.com/content/be27446c-6c80-11e9-a9a5-351eeaef6d84). They are part of a new movement of young Marxist activists who have taken up the cause of labor conditions in China, working alongside manual laborers and organizing protests. Dozens of them have been detained across the country in recent months. “If doing this kind of manual labor makes me disappear, everyone knows who did it,” [Qiu Zhanxuan](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/asia/china-students-peking-university-intl/index.html), the former president of the Peking University Marxist Society, wrote on his social-media page.\n\nChen Duxiu might have recognized this dynamic. He was named the general secretary of the Communist Party, but he clashed with another of the founding members, Mao Zedong, and was pushed out of the position, in 1927. Two years later, Chen was expelled from the Party, on account of his appeal for greater democracy within the ranks. He was later told that he could rejoin if he renounced certain of his positions, but he refused. In 1942, he died, forgotten, in the countryside. After Mao’s death, Chen was rehabilitated as a symbol of patriotism. Were he alive today, however, it’s unclear if he would again accept membership in the Party that he helped found.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8222d4972cd5b8329e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"China","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"china"},{"id":"5c2e1d5e41e4c73c088d7864","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Chinese Communist Party","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"chinese-communist-party"},{"id":"5c2e1ea92710c62d10815628","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Student Protests","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"student-protests"},{"id":"5c2e1c882396212cbb9fc9ae","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Xi Jinping","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"xi-jinping"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590c9596dd6207318b5dae0a","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jiayang Fan became a staff writer at _The New Yorker_ in 2016.

It’s right there, in Article I, Section 2, clause 3: For a government of the people to function, the people must be counted. The Founders wanted an “enumeration” to occur within three years of the first meeting of Congress, and then “within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.” A census, in other words.\n\n \n\nThat sounds straightforward, but, in 2018, the Trump Administration proposed adding a new question to the 2020 census. It’s a simple query, nine words long: “Is this person a citizen of the United States?” The Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, first suggested the change, at the urging of Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, and it has since been met with widespread criticism. Six former directors of the Census Bureau, from both Republican and Democratic Administrations, have come out against the question. A federal judge in California deemed it unconstitutional; another, in New York, found that Ross’s proposal broke a “smorgasbord” of rules. Now the Supreme Court will weigh in.  \n\nThe census has not contained a question about citizenship for seventy years. As the Constitution states, the census is supposed to enumerate all *people* in the United States, not just all citizens. Only seven per cent of the people living in the U.S. are non-citizens, but the number of people living in households with a non-citizen is higher—fourteen per cent. (Among Asian-Americans and Latin-Americans, that figure rises to forty-five and forty-six per cent, respectively.) The Census Bureau’s chief scientist, John Abowd, said that adding a citizenship question would deter at least six hundred and thirty thousand households from completing the form, and a government estimate predicted that 6\\.5 million people might not be counted as a result. That sort of distortion would have enormous consequences. The census determines the distribution of seats in Congress and the Electoral College. It’s also used to apportion nearly a trillion dollars in federal spending, to fund schools, hospitals, and roads. If a segment of the population—whether an entire state or an ethnic community—is undercounted, its resources are diminished accordingly.\n\n \n\nThe Supreme Court prides itself on being apolitical, but this case has already provoked deep partisan feelings. This is precisely because the census is, more than it might seem, a mirror of our politics. It has always reflected the promise and prejudices of our country, and its story drives to the heart of the Constitution—indeed, to its very first three words. Who are we, the people?\n\n +++inline-recirc\n+++\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThat question was important to the Founders, who understood that a precise census was essential for any government of the people to work. Figuring out who lived here had not been not a priority before independence. During British rule, when a new king inherited the throne, the broad reaches of the realm were assessed crudely, and the population was determined through guesswork. In 1714, with the accession of King George I, His Majesty’s counters estimated 375,000 white and 58,000 black subjects in the American colonies. Native Americans were certainly present, but they were not considered subjects, and they went uncounted.\n\n \n\nDuring the American Revolution, the population shot up to about 2\\.75 million people, including half a million African-Americans. After independence, actuarial certainty remained elusive. It was not easy to track people who were perpetually moving west, away from the seat of government and the taxes they associated with it. Counting African-Americans was another challenge. In the earliest days of nationhood, under the Articles of Confederation, Southern states were delighted to count slave populations, because doing so would add to their electoral strength in Congress. But at other times they refused to count them—for example, when a federal tax was tied each state’s population. The compromise reached by the Constitution helped to preserve the Union, but at an egregious cost to democracy. African-Americans were to be counted as “three-fifths of all other persons,” an arrangement that inflated Southern clout and made it impossible to check the spread of slavery until the Civil War.\n\n \n\nStill, the Constitution was a stronger document than the Articles of Confederation, partly because of the census it instituted. The act of counting rooted a rootless people. On the first Monday in August, 1790, U.S. marshals began to fan across the continent, enumerating everyone they could see. It was hard work. There were few rules, and some states needed extensions—especially those that had trouble accepting federal authority, such as Rhode Island and South Carolina. In the early days, the findings were not even published; they were simply posted, in each district, “at two of the most public places&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;to remain for the inspection of all concerned.”\n\n \n\nThat first census was completed in eighteen months. Nearly four million people were counted, which raised the membership of the House of Representatives from sixty-five to a hundred and five. A French statistician was astonished. He declared that the United States was an unprecedented phenomenon, calling the new nation “a people who instituted the statistics of their country on the very day when they founded their government, and who regulated by the same instrument the census of inhabitants, their civil and political rights, and the destinies of the nation.”\n\n \n\nThe very act of asking questions led to more questions, and the census grew fatter each decade. In 1849, the responsibility for the census was removed from its original home, the State Department, and sent into the Department of Interior, which, at the time, was home to such a grab-bag of programs that it was known as the Great Miscellany. The 1850 census was a particular triumph: for the first time, it spanned the continent and tracked the restless inhabitants of California, which had been recently acquired. It required more than three thousand employees to tabulate the results and transport them back to Washington.\n\n \n\nBy 1850, the population of the U.S. had reached a staggering 23,191,876—considerably more than England’s population (fifteen million). Size mattered to Americans, who could not help seeing growth as a sign of divine favor.  Walt Whitman, in his poem “Year of Meteors,” found something lyrical in the dry information being culled across the country. “I would sing in my copious song your census returns of The States,” he wrote, not very poetically. He was far from alone; in the beleaguered early months of the Civil War, Lincoln took solace in predicting an eventual U.S. population of two hundred and fifty million.\n\n \n\nWith the North’s victory, the three-fifths rule was finally eliminated, which, paradoxically, gave more power to the South, since it could now count the entirety of its population. The Fourteenth Amendment stated that the allocation of House seats was to rely on “the whole number of persons in each State”—a reading that has been supported by the Supreme Court ever since. The enumerators went out again in 1870 and 1880, but the task of processing census data was increasingly becoming a headache for civil servants. Sometimes it took almost a full decade to tabulate the results—at which point, of course, it was time for a new census to begin. The questions just kept flowing. Here is one example, from the 1880 form, which shows the census burrowing into the land itself: \n\n 1. *State; county; town*.  \n 2. *What proportion of the land devoted to grain-raising is*  \n*Hilly?  \nRolling?  \nLevel, alluvial or bottom land?*\n 3. *What is the prevailing kind of soil (as clay, loam, alluvial, black prairie, etc.)?*\n 4. *What is the character of the subsoil?*\n\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cc8be0cd6b46f0b290e05ae]||||||\n+++\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nWith the 1890 census looming, the Census Bureau was desperate for a faster way to count. In 1888, it held a contest: using samples of population statistics from St. Louis, it asked challengers to invent new ways of processing data. To general amazement, a twenty-eight-year-old former census employee named Herman Hollerith won easily, with an invention called the electric tabulating machine. One part of the contest asked the candidates to divide the data into categories. It took the second- and third-place competitors forty-four and a half hours and fifty-five and a half hours, respectively. Hollerith’s machine did the same task in five and a half hours.\n\n \n\nHollerith, the son of a German immigrant, grew up in Buffalo, tinkering with machines. He especially liked trains—he had already pioneered an “electro air brake” for them—and it was this passion that led to his idea for tabulation. He knew, from his census work, that it took too long for an enumerator to write out answers by hand, and he had noticed how quickly train conductors could punch passenger tickets as they moved through a crowded car. He reasoned that a device could record the census in a similar way.\n\n \n\nAfter trying a few different models, Hollerith settled upon a long card, approximately six and a half inches by three and a quarter inches, as the best vehicle for the vast amount of information he was processing. He started calling them “punch cards,” because his device tabulated data by punching holes through pre-printed symbols on the cards. These holes represented every point of information on the census: country of national origin, age, marital status, general health, languages spoken. Suddenly, the most exquisitely sensitive points of identity could be instantly noted and calibrated. Race had not disappeared, of course; a world of meaning was spelled out in the upper-left section of the card, where a few fractions of an inch separated the symbols for white (“W”), black (“B”), mulatto (“Mu”), quadroon (“Qd”), and octoroon (“Oc”) Americans.\n\n\nHollerith’s tabulator was a triumph. The 1890 census was by far the largest yet designed; it asked more questions than ever before and deployed enough enumerators (46,804) to constitute a decent army. Those enumerators were supplied with twenty-five million population schedules, weighing more than three hundred tons. They sent back sixty-two million punch cards, all the same size and machine-readable. An experienced tabulation clerk could process eighty punch cards per minute. This new technology led to another huge census, the results of which added up to 21,410 pages. Thanks to Hollerith and his invention, it was the most detailed statistical portrait of the United States that had ever been created.\n\n \n\nBut the 1890 Census did not stop there. It also introduced large-scale data processing to a world that was hungry for it. Following his triumph, Hollerith pursued other ventures, including a census of Russia (the czars had not condescended to count their people since 1851), and an immense data project for the New York Central Railroad. His energies were also drawn to the private sector, and Hollerith founded the Tabulating Machine Company, which merged with other manufacturing companies to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. In 1924, it was renamed International Business Machines, or I.B.M. \n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cc8c66fb36101408ccebf2a]||||||\n+++\n\nHollerith had solved the processing problem, but he had not quite solved the issue of where to store all of the paper that was needed in the pre-digital era. The first ten censuses, from 1790 to 1880, had been bound into books, which cumulatively added up to 4,597 volumes. But the 1890 Census was simply too big to bind; it was five times larger than all the previous censuses combined. The population schedules alone would have added up to thirty thousand volumes. The chief clerk of the census predicted that it would require a seven-thousand-foot shelf  to store them all.\n\n \n\nFinding more than a mile of empty shelf space was difficult, even in a city that was already known for its bureaucracy. So the pile sat around, sparking no joy among the officials charged with its safekeeping. It sprawled across so many pages that copies could not be sent around the country, as earlier censuses had been. Only one copy existed, and it spilled over into different buildings—the Pension Bureau, the Patent Office, and a building called Marini’s Hall. In 1913, it was moved to a new Commerce Department building, where it was consigned to a basement storage area, adjacent to a boiler room. The papers were arranged on narrow pine shelves, in cardboard packages wrapped with twine. The shelves stood very close to each other, only twenty inches apart. The space was also very hot—more than ninety degrees when the boiler was running.  \n\nOn the afternoon of January 10, 1921, an employee noticed smoke coming through openings around the pipes that ran from the boiler room into the file room. The building was evacuated, and firemen were called. The next morning, investigators found charred records floating in ankle-deep water. They believed that the census might have spontaneously combusted. The census director estimated that twenty-five per cent of the records were gone; half of what remained was damaged. The greatest effort in history to tell a nation’s story had gone up in a puff of smoke.\n\n \n\nIn the wake of the fire, the government began to reassess its responsibility to the past. In an op-ed, the Washington *Post* argued that new steps were needed to protect the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, which were then kept in wooden cabinets at the old State Department. The idea of a National Archives also emerged in response to the disaster. The remains of the 1890 Census, meanwhile, were placed in an old brewery, where they lingered for another decade. Congress authorized their destruction on February 21, 1933, the day after President Herbert Hoover laid the cornerstone for the Archives.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nTime is now running short before the 2020 census, our twenty-fourth, will begin. It’s possible that it could be a unifying experience. More likely, it will be bitterly contested, like every other aspect of nationhood. It will also be the most digital census in U.S. history, conducted mostly online and facilitated by enumerators guided by apps. Herman Hollerith would have surely embraced the speed and accuracy that these technologies provide. But they also incite certain fears—that a foreign power might try to hack the result, or that the system will fail for its own reasons. In 2016, a high-tech census crashed in Australia. Thanks to chronic underfunding of the Census Bureau, the census’s new tools have not been rigorously tested. For the fiscal year 2019, the Administration asked Congress to provide four hundred million dollars less to the Bureau than it received in 2009.\n\n \n\nStill, we have no choice but to honor the precise instructions of the Founders. They knew that self-government begins with self-understanding. Accounting for every person in the nation was a matter of principle; no one would have blamed the Washington Administration if it had paused before the first count, in 1790, to deal with more pressing problems. But the nation went ahead with the enumeration, and a government of the people was established. For it to endure, we must once again ask who we are.  \n\n\n\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e9c2396212cbb9fcb74","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Census","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"census"},{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef01ebe912338a371720","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture-desk"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8b06c4c222f03a82ea5","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/ted-widmer","email":"","name":"Ted Widmer","socialMedia":[],"title":"Ted Widmer is a distinguished lecturer at the Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs."}]},"dek":"The simple act of enumeration created data processing, led to the establishment of the National Archives, and rooted a rootless people.

On the campaign trail, [Elizabeth Warren](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/elizabeth-warren), [Kamala Harris](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/what-kamala-harris-is-saying-in-iowa-and-what-she-isnt-presidential-campaign), and [Julián Castro](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/the-democratic-presidential-candidate-eager-to-challenge-trump-on-immigration) have backed impeachment. Warren, who called for impeachment first and has used the strongest language, said, of Trump, at a CNN town hall, in April, “If any other human being in the country had done what’s documented in the Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail.”\n\n \n\nIn recent days, however, even more moderate Democrats have begun speaking about impeachment, in response to Trump’s stonewalling of House investigations. “We’re fighting all the subpoenas,” he told reporters last week. “Look, these aren’t like impartial people. The Democrats are trying to win in 2020\\.” In response, Representative Jamie Raskin, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told the *Times* that he is open to a limited impeachment inquiry, adding, “President Trump’s defiance of Congress is far more comprehensive and sweeping than anything Congress experienced during the Watergate period.”\n\n \n\nAfter Attorney General William Barr refused to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, rejecting the committee’s condition that staff attorneys question him, other House members echoed Raskin’s warning. That morning, on CNN, Representative Ted Lieu said, “If the Trump Administration wants impeachment, they’re doing a good job of pushing Democrats there, because we want to first gather facts to decide if we should impeach. If we can’t gather facts, then we’re going to launch an impeachment.” Of the three articles of impeachment presented against Richard Nixon after Watergate, Lieu noted, the third was contempt of Congress.\n\n \n\nFor now, Democrats are pursuing a strategy that, in practice, could easily turn out to be the first, informal phase of an impeachment inquiry. They’re investigating, but without formally signalling that they believe Trump committed impeachable offenses. When I spoke to several members of the House Judiciary Committee last week, none ruled out the possibility of impeachment. “That’s another possible reasonable course,” Representative Madeleine Dean said. “I happen to like the course we’re on better, and here’s why. I have several key takeaways from the Mueller report that, for me, demand answers to questions. So I’d rather not pre-frame it with ‘We’re doing it in order to impeach or with the hope of impeaching.’ ”\n\n \n\nRepresentative Zoe Lofgren, also on the committee, said, of the progressives advocating for impeachment, “People are trying to do what they think is right, and I respect that.” But, she went on, “This is a serious matter—there have only been three Presidential impeachments in the history of the country, and there have been no removals or convictions under impeachment authority, so this is a rare procedure and should only be done under the most serious of circumstances.” She added, “I personally think we need to have additional hearings.”\n\n \n\nTo what end? So far, the Democrats’ investigations into the Trump Administration and Trump’s personal finances have been less successful in obtaining information than in drawing new cases of Presidential obstruction. But the current course of investigations will continue as long as Democrats remain divided on the issue. Lofgren recounted a recent conversation with a grocery-store clerk in her district who strongly disapproved of Trump but feared that “if Congress impeaches, nothing else will get done.”  \n\n \n\nAnother member of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Sylvia Garcia, told me, “My district is a heavily—seventy, seventy-five per cent—Latino district. They’re concerned about the bread-and-butter issues here. They’re more concerned about some of the things we have on the [Democratic] agenda—high prescription-drug prices, health care, good jobs, immigration reform.”\n\n \n\n“But,” she continued, “they do want to know what happened. They do want answers. And they’re not asking specifically about impeachment, because, you know, that’s not an everyday word. But they do want to know, ‘What did he have to hide?’

Though properly classed as the kind of oversight that the see-no-evil-even-when-you’re-staring-at-it Republicans in Congress avoided for the past two years, it seems clear that Nadler is planning what amounts to pre-impeachment impeachment hearings.\n\nNadler himself cautioned that, regarding the [potential eviction](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/impeachment) of the Trump family from Pennsylvania Avenue, “we don’t have the facts yet,” but the committee’s demand appears designed to assemble as much of what can be known about any potential Trump family depredations as possible, and see where it all leads. [Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) called the demand nothing but “a big fat fishing expedition,” provoking the reflection that you are rarely scared of big fat fishing expeditions unless you know that there are big fat fish lurking somewhere in your pond.\n\nThere is, however, a real and reasonable argument among congressional Democrats—and, indeed, among the public—about whether pursuing Trump’s impeachment, even assuming that we get the facts, is a wise idea. The arguments against it range from the hyper-practical point that a President [Mike Pence](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mike-pence) would be worse, to the procedural-minded one that, since impeaching Trump would mean that two of the four most recent Presidents would have been impeached, and since articles of impeachment can be passed by a simple majority in the House, every President from now on would risk facing it the moment the opposition has a majority. This would create perpetual governmental paralysis, and, while Trump might not care about safeguarding democratic institutions, the country should.\n\nA point common to all the anti-impeachment arguments, though, comes right out of an old Western; as the lawmen used to say about the cattle-rustling varmint after he was caught, “Hanging’s too good for him.” In this case, impeachment is seen as too rarefied, too technical a proceeding to end Trumpism. Trump should be defeated at the polls; ejecting him in any other way provides too many opportunities for after-the-fact stab-in-the-back recriminations, and will only further convince his base that the “deep state” conspired against him. Indeed, given the congressional Republican Party’s cultlike adherence to Trump, beginning a process in the House that can end only with acquittal in the Senate wouldn’t be good for the Democrats, or for the country.\n\nThese arguments have weight. A President Pence would certainly continue to appoint right-wing judges and limit L.G.B.T.Q. rights and ignore climate change and all the rest, and might do so more efficiently, being better able to concentrate on the task without getting distracted by [Fox News](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/fox-news) or the allure of military parades. But what if he did? These may all be policies worth opposing; they’re not crimes that can’t be tolerated. It’s the core premise of any liberal democracy that people have to accept the program of the party in power no matter how little they like it, or even how morally repugnant they find it. The argument for Trump’s eviction rests not on the kinds of laws that he would like to pass but on his unique contempt for the whole concept of the rule of law.\n\nEven before the House investigations get going, or the [Mueller report](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mueller-investigation) is delivered, or the prosecutors finish their work, there is already too much evidence of this contempt to let it alone. Indeed, it is the excess of evidence that now acts as Trump’s sturdiest armor. Back in 1980, Trump destroyed the façade of the old Bonwit Teller building, which he razed to make way for Trump Tower, after being told that he shouldn’t and when no one expected that he would. He has learned that, if you just _do_ things, ordinary people with normal expectations about human behavior will have a hard time believing that you’re doing them.\n\nAny one of a dozen things that Trump has done overtly would have resulted, if done clandestinely by another President, in near-universal cries for impeachment, if not for immediate resignation. Just for a start, his firing of the director of the F.B.I. and then confessing to both a journalist and the Russian foreign minister that he did it to end an investigation into his own campaign’s contacts with Russians follows the exact form of one of the impeachable offenses—[obstruction of justice](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/trump-robert-mueller-and-obstruction-of-justice)—that was applied against Richard Nixon. The “smoking gun” tape smoked because it showed that Nixon had tried to stop the F.B.I. from investigating the Watergate break-in on phony “national security” grounds.\n\nThe best argument for impeachment is, ironically, the case for national unity. Americans ought to be able to agree that, while all opinions are open to debate, some behavior really is out of bounds. An impeachment trial can’t be won? Well, the Republican Party may be obedient now, but there is just enough Never Trumping among those who were once the staunchest of conservatives to make it clear that the difference between constitutional conservatism and thuggishness is real and can be argued for, and maybe even partly won.\n\nThe House may soon find itself moving toward impeachment in any case. On top of the House investigations, New York State regulators last week subpoenaed Trump’s insurance broker, following allegations of irregularities raised during the recent testimony of [Michael Cohen](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/michael-cohen). Meanwhile, federal prosecutors continue to explore various activities related to Trump’s campaign and his family businesses.\n\nThe long-term consequences of impeachment are unknowable; long-term consequences always are. The foreclosed impeachment of Nixon was more or less a political wash: the Democrats held the House for another twenty years, while the Republicans regained the White House just six years later. The impeachment of [Bill Clinton](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/bill-clinton), however high his approval ratings were when the resolution passed in the House, may have hurt [Al Gore](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/al-gore) in the 2000 election. But, within eight years, the Democrats had regained control of both Congress and the White House.\n\nPragmatism is not a way of negating principle but, rather, the realist’s way of pursuing principle. The arguments against impeachment today are primarily pragmatic, the arguments for it primarily principled, but the principled course could, before long, turn into the only practical course. Impeachment may be too good for Trump. It may yet prove just the thing for the country. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"functional-tags":[{"id":"5c7fffef68f3a83129be1f5a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apple News Opt In","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"apple-news-opt-in"},{"id":"5baa8845956e672d0b2db124","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apple News Preview","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"apple-news-preview"},{"id":"5baa883e8688f82d6d666ad0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apple News Paid","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"apple-news-paid"}],"sections":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909ff4b1c7a8e33fb390bbb","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Adam Gopnik, a staff writer, has been contributing to *The New Yorker* since 1986.

Wearing a blue suit, with a pin-striped shirt and a striped tie, Ford took a seat in a Capitol Hill hearing room, looked up at the members of a Democratic-controlled House Judiciary subcommittee arrayed on a dais above him, and testified for two hours. Ford was only the third President, after Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson, to voluntarily waive executive privilege and testify before Congress. A President answering questions from members of a co-equal branch of government marked, depending on one’s perspective, either a perversion of America’s constitutional order or the embodiment of it. Ford hoped that his appearance would help heal the country.\n\nThat September, just a month after Ford had assumed the Presidency, he stunned Americans by issuing a full and unconditional pardon of the former President Richard Nixon. The decision, which he announced in a surprise Sunday-morning television address, outraged many and, arguably, doomed his Presidency. Ford’s approval rating dropped from seventy-one per cent to fifty per cent.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, which had passed three articles of impeachment against Nixon that July, immediately launched an investigation into whether Ford had secretly promised Nixon a pardon in exchange for the Presidency. “There never was at any time any agreement whatsoever concerning a pardon to Mr. Nixon if he were to resign and I were to become President,” Ford testified. “I was absolutely convinced then as I am now that if we had had this series, an indictment, trial, conviction, and anything else that transpired after that, that the attention of the President, the Congress, and the American people would have been diverted from the problems that we have to solve.” \n\nForty-five years later, [President Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) and his allies are invoking an unprecedented form of executive privilege that would systematically undermine Congress’s power and the post-Watergate norms established by Ford. Those practices, followed by six subsequent Republican and Democratic Presidents, involve the executive branch coöperating, at least in limited form, with congressional investigations and subpoenas. Failure to do so, it was assumed, could hurt a President politically. \n\nOn Monday, the Democrat-controlled House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena for Donald McGahn, the former White House counsel and a key figure in the [Mueller report](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mueller-investigation), to appear before it and present documents related to investigations of the President. On Tuesday, in a step never taken before by a modern President, Trump declared that he would bar McGahn—and all current and former Administration officials—from testifying before Congress, and, further, that the Administration would ignore all subpoenas from the legislative branch. “We’re fighting all the subpoenas,” Trump told reporters outside the White House on Wednesday. “These aren’t, like, impartial people. The Democrats are trying to win 2020\\.”\n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nAs Peter Baker recently [noted](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/us/politics/mueller-investigation-watergate.html) in the *Times,* it has been politically unthinkable since Watergate that a President could fire an F.B.I. director who was investigating him or his associates, force out an Attorney General for failing to protect him from an investigation, or offer pardons to potential witnesses against him. Now Trump is flatly dismissing Congress’s authority to conduct oversight of the executive branch. Unless Trump is stopped by court rulings, his defiant brand of politics and his sweeping control of the Republican Party will redefine the balance of power between the President and Congress for decades. \n\nTrump’s approach is the opposite of the one that Ford adopted. At first, Ford’s decision to testify appeared to pay off—the Judiciary Committee soon closed its investigation. But the reprieve for the Presidency was short-lived. That November, Democrats won a landslide victory in the midterm elections, gaining a two-thirds majority in the House and sixty seats in the Senate. With Watergate and Vietnam fuelling public suspicion of Presidential power, Congress reached the apex of its power in modern American politics. Already, in 1973, overriding a veto by Nixon, Congress had enacted the War Powers Resolution, which required Presidents to halt military operations after sixty days if they were not approved by Congress. In 1974, it passed amendments that strengthened the Freedom of Information Act, giving the public greater access to government documents. Antonin Scalia, then a Justice Department official, argued to Ford that the amendments infringed on the secrecy of the F.B.I. and other intelligence agencies. Ford vetoed the amendments, newspaper editorials across the country assailed him, and Congress easily overrode his veto, with a 65–27 vote in the Senate and a 371–31 vote in the House. The legislative tide continued under President Jimmy Carter. The Ethics in Government Act, which, among other things, created the Office of Special Counsel and required officials to file financial-disclosure forms, was enacted in 1978\\. The same year, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was signed into law, limiting the ability of the executive branch to surveil Americans without a court order. \n\nFord, in an effort to regain public trust, also voluntarily enacted multiple reforms. After a congressional investigation uncovered decades of improper activities by both the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., he issued an executive order barring political assassinations and supported the establishment of congressional committees to oversee the intelligence agencies. \n\nYet Ford also fought back against what he viewed as an erosion of Presidential power. In his two and a half years as President, he issued sixty-six vetoes, the highest rate of any modern President. Democrats overrode them a dozen times. Donald Rumsfeld, a former congressman from Illinois who, in 1974, at the age of forty-two, was named Ford’s chief of staff, fiercely defended executive-branch power. So did Rumsfeld’s deputy, Dick Cheney, who, a year later, at the age of thirty-four, became chief of staff, when Ford named Rumsfeld as his Secretary of Defense. \n\nSubsequent Republican and Democratic Presidents have also fought congressional oversight. The Reagan and Bush Administrations sparred with the legislative branch throughout the Iran-Contra scandal. Bill Clinton battled House investigations into the Whitewater land deal and the White House travel office, and also into his impeachment, for perjury and obstruction of justice, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. During George W. Bush’s Administration, Vice-President Dick Cheney contended that the executive branch had the power to secretly surveil Americans without obtaining a court order from the *FISA*{:.small} court. (After the *Times* revealed the surveillance, the Administration altered the program and obtained judicial and congressional approval for it.) Barack Obama, too, resisted congressional investigation. His Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress after he declined to provide a Republican-controlled House committee with documents it requested regarding the so-called Fast and Furious investigation. The Administration, along with Democrats in Congress, argued that the investigation, which looked into the sale of illegal guns as part of a counter-narcotics operation, was a meritless effort to score political points. After a six-year legal battle, the case was settled by the Trump Administration, which turned over a limited number of documents to Congress. \n\nThe idea that a President such as Ford would testify before Congress and somehow set the record straight now seems quaint. Investigations are increasingly dismissed by voters as fishing expeditions. The eyes of liberals glaze over when Benghazi is mentioned. (That probe succeeded, at least politically, by uncovering Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.) The eyes of conservatives glaze over when Trump-Russia is cited. (That inquiry succeeded, at least politically, by uncovering evidence of attempted obstruction of justice by Trump.) Stonewalling investigations and rallying one’s political base appear to be a savvy way to secure a high voter turnout, which is needed to win elections in an increasingly divided country. In this case, Trump is exacerbating a preëxisting trend in American politics, not creating one. The question is whether a 2020 candidate can emerge who can restore lost trust and norms and garner votes.

Their journey had begun five years earlier, when Ahmad and his wife attempted to flee Syria, in the run-up to the civil war. On their way to the Damascus airport, the couple was stopped at a checkpoint, where Ahmad, who had participated in opposition protests, was beaten by Syrian officials and forced to pay a five-hundred-dollar bribe in exchange for his and his family’s release. They were able to live as temporary residents in Abu Dhabi until the U.A.E. government unexpectedly expelled the family, in December, 2015. Ahmad, who asked to be identified only by his middle name, knew that his life would be at risk if the family returned to Syria; instead, they flew to New York on U.S. tourist visas. Two days after landing at J.F.K. airport, Ahmad got a call from a Syrian friend in Canada, who told him that the new Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, was welcoming Syrians. “Come to the border,” he said. “They will accept you.”\n\nWhat Ahmad didn’t know, though, is that the few days his family had spent in the U.S., researching where they could get refugee status, would ultimately decide their fate. An agreement between the U.S. and Canada, called the Safe Third Country Agreement (S.T.C.A.), prohibits most immigrants who pass through the U.S. from making a subsequent claim for asylum at a land-border entry in Canada, and vice versa. The agreement, which was signed in 2002, is designed to prevent “asylum shopping.” Canada deems the U.S. “safe” as long as it maintains a good human-rights record and complies with its obligations under accords stipulating that asylum seekers cannot be returned to countries where they may face persecution. At the Canadian border, where Ahmad’s family was held for twelve hours, an officer told them, “I have to send you back to the U.S.” Ahmad’s wife screamed and collapsed. They spent the night sleeping on the floor of a jail cell in Buffalo.\n\nFollowing [Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s executive orders on immigration, in 2017—including a travel ban for several Muslim-majority countries—Canada reviewed its asylum agreement with the U.S. According to the [Canadian Press](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/10/22/canada-officials-deem-us-a-safe-country-for-asylum-seekers-after-internal-review.html), which obtained documents under Canada’s access-to-information law, Canadian officials concluded that the U.S. “continues to meet the requirements for designation as a safe third country.” Last year, Trump began the practice of separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border, as part of his zero-tolerance policy on illegal immigration. Trudeau was fiercely [criticized](https://globalnews.ca/news/4282894/donald-trump-family-separation-child-detention-justin-trudeau/) for his initial silence on the issue, and legal experts again called for the government to [suspend](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-trump-border-immigration-crackdown-1.4711030) the S.T.C.A. A number of critics, including Nadia Abu-Zahra, an associate professor of international development and global studies at the University of Ottawa, [noted](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/canada-faces-mounting-pressure-to-end-safe-third-country-agreement-with-u-s-1.3984274) that Canada signed the agreement two months after the U.S. government deported a Canadian citizen, Maher Arar, to Syria, where he was subsequently tortured. Regarding the U.S. as safe for refugees, she told CTV News, “was incorrect in 2002 and that assumption is now very visibly incorrect with babies being taken away from their mothers and children being held in cages.”\n\nA team of attorneys [began the search](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/safe-third-country-agreement-legal-test-case-1.4195228) for a federal-court challenge. In the summer of 2017, Prasanna Balasundaram, an attorney with the University of Toronto’s Downtown Legal Services, got a call from a client he was representing in immigration proceedings. The client’s common-law partner had travelled from El Salvador with her two young daughters and arrived at the Fort Erie–Buffalo border crossing, hoping to join him in Toronto. But when she asked for asylum in Canada, claiming that she feared returning to El Salvador, where she had been raped and extorted by MS-13 gang members, officials told her she was ineligible; because she had first entered the U.S., she was only allowed to seek asylum there. Balasundaram told me, “There was no doubt in my mind that these are people who truly face risk in El Salvador.”\n\nEventually, the woman and two other parties agreed to be litigants in a legal challenge to the S.T.C.A.; it argues that continuing to designate the U.S. as safe violates Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The S.T.C.A. was nearly overturned in 2007, when a federal judge ruled that the agreement was unconstitutional, in part because the U.S. was not a safe third country for asylum seekers. “There are the vagaries of U.S. law which put women, particularly those subject to domestic violence, at real risk of return to their home country,” the judge [wrote](https://www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/imce/images/STCA%20FC%20Judgment%202007%20FC%201262.pdf). An appeals court, however, overturned the decision the following year, and the Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear the case. “That was before the more recent changes in the U.S.,” Janet Dench, the executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees, one of the applicants in the current case, told me. “There’s even more evidence the U.S. is not safe, and many Canadians are watching in horror with what is happening in the U.S.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn January, 2018, [an investigation](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/15/when-deportation-is-a-death-sentence) in this magazine by [Sarah Stillman](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/sarah-stillman) documented the fates of women who are deported from the U.S. despite expressing fears of returning to their countries of origin. I was a member of Stillman’s research team, which recorded more than sixty cases of people who had been deported to gendered violence and death. The first screening of asylum seekers at the U.S. border often falls to Customs and Border Protection officers, who are required to identify whether such migrants fear return. Stillman wrote, “My team and I heard stories from more than a dozen women who say that they were never asked the required questions, or were ignored, mocked, or even sexually propositioned by U.S. agents after expressing their fears—and then deported to harm.”\n\nIn June, 2018, [Jeff Sessions](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeff-sessions), who was then the Attorney General, issued a ruling that blocked asylum for victims of domestic violence. According to attorneys in the U.S. who shared a number of judicial decisions with *The New Yorker,* immigration judges routinely cited Sessions’s opinion as the reason for denying a claim. In one case, a Salvadoran woman described her husband pouring hot coffee on her, threatening to kill her, and physically abusing her to the point of hospitalization. In another, a Honduran woman faced persistent sexual and physical abuse by her husband, who commandeered her children’s documents and threatened to harm her if she went to the police. In yet another case, a Honduran woman’s domestic partner kept her locked in her home and subjected her to repeated sexual assault.\n\nSessions’s opinion—which narrowed the definition of persecution to exclude non-governmental groups, including gangs—substantially reduced the rate of Central Americans granted asylum. According to [Human Rights First](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/Asylum_Grant_Rates.pdf), over the following six months, acceptance rates for people from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala fell from 23\\.9 per cent to 14\\.4 per cent. Dench, at the Canadian Council for Refugees, thought that the ruling amounted to a “nail in the coffin” for the S.T.C.A. Karen Musalo, the director of the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law, is an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the legal challenge to the S.T.C.A. During the government’s cross-examination, she shared her concerns about the “bullying, chilling effect on adjudication” of Sessions’s decision. “You have to look at what effect it has when the Attorney General is issuing a decision like this, and you have immigration judges who are basically the employees of the Attorney General,” she told me. “He’s sending a clear message that these cases are not to be granted.”\n\nThe Canadian government has been cross-examining witnesses since November, 2018, and oral arguments could begin in May. In the meantime, the Trump Administration has taken additional efforts to deter asylum claims in the U.S. In April, [William Barr](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/william-barr), who took over as Attorney General after the President [fired](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/trump-fires-jeff-sessions-and-throws-his-administration-back-into-chaos) Sessions, announced that asylum seekers in detention would not be granted bail until their cases were processed. A few weeks later, Trump ordered authorities to charge application fees to asylum seekers and to eliminate applicants’ access to work permits. Even before these recent announcements, the litigants in the Canadian case had presented the court with “mountains of expert evidence,” Alex Neve, the secretary general of Amnesty International Canada, told me. “The record of information in front of the court is a searing indictment.” If a federal judge decides that deeming the U.S. safe is unconstitutional, Canada could stop sending people back to the U.S., effectively suspending the S.T.C.A.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nAt the Berks Family Residential Center, Ahmad’s family was separated at night, by gender, into different cells; if one of their toddlers crawled into bed with one of them, the guards would separate them. In February, 2016, Carol Anne Donohoe, an attorney who specializes in asylum law, learned of the family’s case. When Donohoe met Ahmad, “he was still clearly in shock,” she wrote in an affidavit filed in the Canadian case. “He was so horrified&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that he asked me if they could request being sent to Sudan because he’d heard Sudan accepts refugees.” Ahmad told Donohoe he was afraid that if he applied for asylum he would be separated from his family and detained. Even during the Obama Administration, Donohoe had seen mothers and children detained for up to a year, then transferred to the “black hole” of Berks. “I tried to reassure him,” Donohoe wrote, “but I remember thinking, I don’t know what this country is capable of doing anymore.” \n\nShe prepared a parole request, arguing that their detention was “against policy directives” and “human decency.” They were released after about two weeks and have been in court proceedings since. The family is currently living in New Jersey under Temporary Protected Status. While they have provisional relief, Ahmad fears that Trump could revoke T.P.S. for Syrians, as he has done for citizens of other countries. “I started blaming myself,” Ahmad told me. “How could I bring my wife and kids to this place?” \n\nIn March, the S.T.C.A. again appeared in Canadian headlines. The Trudeau government is approaching U.S. lawmakers to negotiate its expansion. The agreement doesn’t currently apply to asylum seekers who cross through fields and forests, at unofficial entry points. Bill Blair, the Border Security Minister, has [vowed](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/03/15/border-security-minister-mulling-ways-to-close-loophole-in-safe-third-country-agreement.html) to close this “loophole.” His proposal would transport asylum seekers who cross irregularly to official entry points, where they would be denied entry under the S.T.C.A. Earlier this month, the Trudeau government [buried](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trudeau-defends-hard-line-on-border-crossers-as-refugee-advocates/) new immigration measures into its nearly four-hundred-page omnibus budget [bill](https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-97/first-reading): a person who previously claimed asylum with one of Canada’s Five Eyes intelligence allies—Australia, Britain, New Zealand, and the U.S.—is ineligible for protection in Canada. “We’re closing the border to everybody,” Jenny Kwan, a Member of Parliament who has called for the suspension of the agreement, told me. “It’s not an actual wall, but, effectively, it means the same thing.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d2e4a08312cd3aa6cdc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d2e4a08312cd3aa6cdc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Canada","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"canada"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Canada","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"canada"},{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274665","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274665","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Asylum

She lived with her husband, Kevin, their seventeen-month-old daughter, Grethshell, and two elementary-school-aged children from Sindy’s previous relationship. That morning, she made breakfast for Kevin and saw him off to his job as a house painter. But, as Sindy washed the dishes, gangsters arrived at her home and threatened her life—a common occurrence in Tegucigalpa, the capital of a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world.\n\n \n\nSindy called Kevin at work in a panic, and they decided that she should pack their things and leave home. “Come quick,” he told her. “We’ll figure out our next steps.” She stuffed her children’s backpacks full of clothes and grabbed Grethshell’s favorite toy: a doll that had been a birthday gift from Kevin. “I left behind my two little dogs, Whitey and Stuey,” Sindy told me. The hardest part, she said, was “to tell my kids they couldn’t go to school anymore, they couldn’t see their friends anymore, that everything in their lives was going to change.”\n\n \n\nThe couple decided to head for San Francisco, where Sindy has an uncle. They took a bus through Guatemala, then traversed Mexico by rail. In Puebla, as they prepared to board a gritty train known as La Bestia with other migrants, Mexican authorities surrounded the group, beating and chasing them. In the chaos, Kevin hopped on the train, clutching Grethshell to his chest, and thinking that Sindy had already boarded. In fact, Sindy remained on the ground with the two older children, looking for her husband and toddler. For days, she and the children wandered around Puebla, searching for signs of their whereabouts. Finally, she realized that they must have continued north and started after them. As she walked, she asked fellow-migrants, “Have you seen a man with a little girl named Grethshell?”\n\n\n[#cneembed: script/video/5c4b94d040f9485a08000009.js?muted=1]||| \n|||\n \nOn January 1st, Sindy reached Calexico, a city on California’s southern border, and approached U.S. Border Patrol agents. She told a tall male agent that she and her children had fled Honduras and feared that it was too dangerous to return. “I don’t care if one of your kids dies,” he said, according to Sindy. “You should have gone to Canada.” She told him that she had been separated from her husband and toddler and asked if he had seen the pair pass through Border Patrol’s custody, or if he could help her locate them. “You’re a bad mother,” he replied, according to Sindy. (“Those are terrible things to say, and we don’t condone that type of behavior,” David Kim, the assistant chief patrol agent for U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s El Centro sector, told me, of Sindy’s account. “However, I’m not aware of any complaints that were lodged or filed from her.”)\n\n \n\nSindy and her two children were sent to a cold cell, sometimes called a *hielera*, or icebox. Several Guatemalan migrant women in the cell told Sindy that they had seen her little girl—they had called her by her middle name, Juliet, which was easier for them to pronounce—a few days earlier and had helped to care for her. Kevin had arrived with Grethshell on December 28th, to seek asylum; he was quickly charged with illegal reëntry because of prior deportations from some years ago. Six months earlier, the Trump Administration had pledged to stop most family separations at the border. But in Kevin’s case they took Grethshell, wailing, from his arms—to where, they didn’t say. (“This isn’t just a case of ‘Let’s separate a family for no reason,’&nbsp;” Kim, from C.B.P., told me. “A child is never going to accompany an adult when they are being charged with a crime.”)\n\n \n\nA few days later, Sindy and her older children were released and went to live with her uncle in San Francisco. (Her own removal proceedings are pending, and she hopes to seek asylum.) From there, she ramped up her search and discovered that Grethshell had been transferred from California to Texas and placed in a federally contracted shelter for “unaccompanied” children, run by a nonprofit organization called B.C.F.S., in San Antonio. The girl, she’d been told, was in the care of a foster mother. Sindy checked every box for Grethshell’s return: she offered proof of identity, gave her fingerprints, and answered interview questions. “There’s not one piece of paper I haven’t filled out,” she told me.\n\n \n\nBut, according to Sindy, when she called the shelter, she hit a new obstacle. A person told her that she would have to pay the cost of her daughter’s return: in this case, two plane tickets to San Francisco—one for Grethshell and the other for a government guardian to fly with her. “How much is it going to cost to get her back?” Sindy asked. The person couldn’t be sure but estimated up to three thousand dollars. “But I don’t have the money!” she replied. (On Monday, a spokeswoman for B.C.F.S. denied that Sindy will have to pay for her child’s transportation.) Sindy felt caught in a paradox. “When they let me out of detention, they said I can’t work legally, and that if I did they would deport me,” she said. She didn’t know how she would get her daughter back.\n\n \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nLast June, amid public outcry, [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) signed an executive order putting an ostensible end to the practice of taking children from their parents at the border. “I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated,” he said at the time. But advocates say that the practice has continued in quieter, more insidious forms. Many recent separations involve parents who have past deportations or misdemeanors, as was the case with Kevin. Other cases involve children who arrived with relatives or guardians who are not their biological parents. Last October, I documented the [case of a five-year-old girl named Helen](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-five-year-old-who-was-detained-at-the-border-and-convinced-to-sign-away-her-rights) who was separated from her grandmother at the southern border, then sent to a B.C.F.S. shelter; in custody, officials told her to sign complicated legal paperwork giving up her right to go before an immigration judge. After a long fight to win Helen’s release, her grandmother, Noehmi, told me, “I fear there are still other children suffering. Other families are feeling this anguish, this struggle, and they need us to act.”\n\n \n\nGrethshell’s case proves Noehmi right. The details, which I’ve pieced together through interviews, public records, and private correspondence—and through footage that Sindy shared with me, which shows an anguished video conference between her and her toddler—shed light on the many bureaucratic hurdles that parents face when they seek to be reunited with their confiscated children. One such obstacle is a practice that immigration-reform advocates describe as separation for ransom, by which parents are asked to pay for the cost of their children’s return. This practice is sanctioned by official policy; according to the Web site of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (O.R.R.), parents or other legal sponsors of a separated child are “responsible for the unaccompanied alien child’s transportation costs and, if the care provider is escorting the child, for the care provider’s transportation or airfare.” In July, [the *Times* documented](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/01/us/migrant-children-families.html) several cases in which migrant families were asked to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars in fees or transportation costs to secure the return of their children, describing the process as “an exhausting, intimidating—and sometimes expensive—thicket of requirements.” Six months after Trump’s executive order, advocates say that the thicket hasn’t cleared.\n\n \n\n“This is an issue we’ve been dealing with for the past few months,” Blake Vera, the bond coördinator for *RAICES*{: .small}, a Texas-based nonprofit organization that advocates for immigrants, told me. Asylum seekers often have no source of income to pay for transportation expenses, which can leave their children languishing in detention for weeks or months. The steps for reunification are opaque, disorganized, and full of misinformation, Vera says, leaving parents vulnerable to scams. “These families get contacted by some random number with a person telling them they have to give them their credit-card information in order to get reunited with their own child,” he told me. “That’s just completely inappropriate.”\n\n \n\nVera told me that, one day earlier this month, he spent an hour on the phone trying to find a B.C.F.S. worker who was willing to discuss a case of an indigenous Guatemalan child whose family lacked the money for her transportation fee. Two weeks ago, on a call about the same case, Vera said that a B.C.F.S. employee reassured him, “If the family expresses financial hardship, we won’t keep their child hostage—they just need to communicate that.” This perplexed Vera; from the start, he told me, “The family had been saying over and over, ‘We don’t have the money.’&nbsp;” On Monday, a spokeswoman from B.C.F.S. also told me that the organization does not charge transportation costs to parents who can’t afford it and that it had recently requested a hardship waiver from O.R.R. for the Guatemalan family, which had been approved. “B.C.F.S. works with the parent on this,” she said. “The child is flown at no charge to the parent.” But, according to Vera, who says that *RAICES*{: .small} has worked on multiple cases in which O.R.R. shelters asked migrant parents to pay for transportation, many parents are never told about the possibility of receiving a fee waiver.\n\n \n\nI first learned of Grethshell’s case through Eric Fish, a trial attorney at the Federal Defenders of San Diego who is representing Kevin. Kevin’s felony charge for illegal reëntry came with a silver lining: he had access to a public defender, which his wife and kids did not. (Asylum seekers—even unaccompanied children—have no right to free legal representation in immigration court.) Fish learned that Kevin’s daughter had been seized and attempted to locate the girl, which produced conflicting results. On January 17th, a federal prosecutor forwarded Sindy’s uncle’s address to Fish and suggested that Grethshell had been resettled there. “This is the physical location of his child in San Fran,” the prosecutor wrote. But an investigator working in Fish’s office soon reached Sindy, who told him that Grethshell had not been returned and that, to get her back, she needed thousands of dollars—money she didn’t have.\n\n \n\nFish got in touch with *RAICES*{: .small}, and the organization offered to help pay the flight costs for the toddler, which felt to Fish like progress. But, when he reached out to B.C.F.S. about the case, he had trouble getting the personal information about the toddler and chaperone, which was required to purchase the tickets. *RAICES*{:.small} thought that Sindy, with an advocate, had a good chance of receiving a “waiver for hardship” to defray the costs.\n\n \n\nEach day, new hurdles popped up. On Thursday, Fish called me, dumbfounded. He’d just been told that, to return Grethshell, the government requires a form that he hadn’t heard mentioned before: a “letter of designation” from Kevin, stating that he wants Grethshell returned to her mother. Given that Kevin had just been transferred to detention, in Arizona, this feat would prove difficult. “I will have to move mountains to get this form signed,” Fish wrote to B.C.F.S. staff. His team worked hard to get the new form signed by Kevin and handed it over to B.C.F.S. on Monday. But, later that day, Fish learned that this would not suffice for O.R.R.’s approval: the form needed to be notarized—a very difficult service to access while in detention.\n\nFish has succeeded, at least, in getting Kevin’s criminal charges dropped, though Kevin remains in detention and faces deportation. He hopes to win asylum, but he can’t easily afford a lawyer for his immigration case. Sindy fears that her husband will be killed if he gets sent back to Honduras; he’s her beloved, and the family’s breadwinner. “But at least my husband is a grown man,” she said. “My little girl is defenseless.”\n\n \n\nWhen I spoke to the B.C.F.S. spokeswoman on Monday, she told me that Sindy would be not be required to pay for her child’s transportation. “We looked into the situation, and there is no charge,” she said. Instead, the case was being held up, she said, because of O.R.R.’s requirement for the notarized form. “If they need the signature, they need the signature,” she said. “We can’t change the law.” Around two hours later, she told me that B.C.F.S. has requested that O.R.R. waive the notary requirement. Following our inquiry, they had moved to expedite Grethshell’s return. On Tuesday evening, as this piece neared publication, Sindy was told that her daughter would soon be put on a flight to San Francisco. (Several hours after publication, the two were reunited.)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nLast week, I reached Sindy by phone at her uncle’s house in San Francisco, and she described her toddler to me, gushing about her eating habits. “She’ll eat anything,” she said—rice, beans, fruit. “The only thing she doesn’t like is milk from a bottle. She only likes to breast-feed.” This isn’t an option for Grethshell right now; she has been in government custody for a month and has been staying with a foster family. “I don’t know if they’ve done my daughter psychological harm,” Sindy said. “They say they haven’t—that she’s a little girl, and she has no memories.” (In fact, last year, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a [statement opposing family separation](https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/StatementOpposingSeparationofChildrenandParents.aspx) because of its psychological effects. “Highly stressful experiences, like family separation, can cause irreparable harm, disrupting a child’s brain architecture and affecting his or her short- and long-term health,” the statement reads. “This type of prolonged exposure to serious stress—known as toxic stress—can carry lifelong consequences for children.”) She worries about her daughter. “I’m the only one who knows how to take care of Grethshell—I’m her mother!” she said. “I imagine that she is living in terror.”\n\n \n\nSindy hopes that she’ll get to hold her child soon. Since mid-January, she has been allowed to speak to her daughter once a week, by video conference. On their first call, Sindy mostly cried, and Grethshell did, too. When Sindy got another chance, last week, she worked to keep her cool. She filmed the whole exchange and provided me with the footage, which—in an eerie scene—captures the emotional toll of a child’s prolonged separation from her parents.\n\n \n\nIn the video, Grethshell sits beneath a large TV, which flashes ads for Disney movies. B.C.F.S. posters hang on the walls above brightly colored children’s toys. Seeing Grethshell in her pink-wrapped pigtails, Sindy coos and coaxes, trying to connect with her child. “Hi, my love, it’s mommy calling,” she says.\n\n \n\nOn hearing her mother’s voice, Grethshell begins to wail, and a woman picks her up to comfort her. (The woman keeps her back turned so that Sindy can’t see her face, and never speaks, but Sindy is under the impression that the woman is Grethshell’s new foster mother.) Grethshell dodges her mother’s eyes and won’t smile. Sindy wondered if the girl felt betrayed, abandoned. “How serious you look, Grethshell, my love,” Sindy says.\n\n \n\nAt one point, Sindy brings her older children on the phone to say hello. “Where is the baby? Where is the baby?” her nine-year-old asks, adding, “Mom, I miss Grethshell.”\n\n \n\nAgain, Sindy tries to break through. “How beautiful you are, my daughter,” she says. Finally, she asks a shelter worker, who is monitoring the call from offscreen, “She’s resentful, right?”\n\n \n\n“Well, I think now she’s a little better,” the worker replies. She offers Sindy a strange consolation: Grethshell has developed an affinity for her new foster mother. “She’s very close to the woman from the house,” the worker says. (This news devastated Sindy. “She’s in a house with a family, and that worries me,” she told me. “If they’re going to give her to another family, why don’t they give her to me?”)\n\n \n\nNear the end of the video, Sindy starts calling her daughter by a pet name. “Where is mami’s precious chichi?” she says. “My precious chichi, you’ll soon be with me. You’ll see.”\n\n*This piece has been updated to include information about Sindy and Grethshell’s reunification.*\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1d4b81ab3335f580f222","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Honduras","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"honduras"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d41c92e2c9b85da22","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Trump Administration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"trump-administration"},{"id":"5c2e1d5e41c92e2c9b85db09","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Family Separation","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"family-separation"},{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274665","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Asylum Seekers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"asylum-seekers"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e41e4c73c088d7763","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Border Crisis","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"border-crisis"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02abc14b3c606c109f00","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sarah Stillman is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

She was in an unusually hopeful mood. Her twenty-third birthday was nine days away, and she and her nineteen-year-old cousin, Elizabeth, had been discussing party plans at the restaurant. They’d decided to have coolers of beer, a professional d.j., and dancing after Laura put her three sons to bed. Now they were heading home, and giving two of Laura’s friends a ride, with a quick detour for hamburgers. Elizabeth said that, as they neared the highway, a cop flashed his lights at them. The officer, Nazario Solis III, claimed that Laura had been driving between lanes and asked to see her license and proof of insurance.\n\nLaura had neither. She’d lived in the United States undocumented her whole adult life.\n\n“Do you have your residence card?” Solis asked.\n\n“No,” Laura said, glancing anxiously at her cousin and her friends. Solis questioned them, too. Only Elizabeth had a visa, which she fished out of her purse. Solis directed the others to get out of the car. “I’m calling Border Patrol,” he said—an unusual move, at the time, for a small-town cop in South Texas.\n\nLaura panicked. At five feet two inches and barely a hundred pounds, she looked younger than her age. She often wore tube tops and short shorts, and styled her hair in a girlish bob. Her affect was “attached to childhood,” her older brother told me; she collected porcelain dolls, and loved Japanese anime and Saturday-morning cartoons. Laura’s friends saw her trembling. Like her, they had kids who were U.S. citizens and steady jobs they didn’t want to lose, but they knew that Laura’s fear was distinct. She had an ex-husband across the border, in Reynosa, Mexico, who had promised to kill her if she returned.\n\n“I can’t be sent back to Mexico,” Laura told Solis, beginning to cry. “I have a protection order against my ex—please, just let me call my mom and she’ll bring you the paperwork.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cneembed: script/video/5a3197842d1ca04932000030.js?autoplay=0]|||\n**The Immigrants Deported to Death and Violence**\nSarah Stillman reports on people who fled their home countries fearing for their lives, and the tragic consequences when they were sent back.\n|||\n+++\n\nLaura’s two-year-old had an operation scheduled for later that week, to remove an abscess in his neck, and Laura also told Solis about that. “I need to be here,” she begged, in Spanish. In English, Elizabeth detailed the threats from Laura’s ex, Sergio. “You can’t do this,” Elizabeth said. “He’ll kill her.”\n\n“Sorry,” Solis replied, shrugging. “I already called.” (Solis could not be reached for comment. He was later sent to prison for unrelated convictions, including bribery, extortion, and drug conspiracy.)\n\nLaura had started dating Sergio when she was eighteen, and he soon became physically abusive. After a particularly horrific night the previous spring, when Sergio assaulted her, Laura had finally called the police, and coöperated with them to secure his arrest. He was later deported. In the year since then, Laura had tried to create a normal childhood for her sons. She shared a small trailer with Elizabeth and the boys near the Sharyland Plantation, a gated community of houses with lima-bean-shaped swimming pools and Roman-pillared porches which advertised its “delicate scent of hibiscus and bougainvillea flowers.” Sometimes she’d dress the boys in cowboy outfits, and use the neighbors’ sheep and horses as their personal petting zoo. At night, she’d sneak into the citrus groves and pick oranges for breakfast, humming her favorite song, “Single Mom”: “A single mother who does not worry, who will always fight to be a mom. Tell him she can be a mother without him.” Still, Sergio haunted her. In Mexico, he’d reportedly joined a local drug cartel. He often texted Laura death threats.\n\nLaura and her friends waited by the roadside until a U.S. Border Patrol agent named Ramiro Garza arrived and ordered the three of them into his vehicle. Laura pleaded with Garza as he drove them to a nearby processing center, where Laura’s friends saw her, under pressure, sign paperwork for a “voluntary return.” Three hours later—after holding off until dawn “for safety reasons,” Garza later explained, “since there were females involved”—he drove them to the McAllen-Hidalgo International Bridge, which crosses the Rio Grande and leads to Reynosa, a city so violent that the U.S. State Department forbids its employees there from venturing out after midnight.\n\nAs the sun rose, Laura stepped onto the bridge and into a much larger story, one that has launched a major legal battle over the U.S. government’s duty to protect prospective deportees who plead for their lives. The lawsuit, and others like it, has implications for the treatment of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who have found refuge in the United States, and for whom deportation can be tantamount to death. Some, like Laura, are survivors of domestic violence seeking safety in the U.S. Others, like Elizabeth, are Dreamers, undocumented youths who were granted relief from deportation under President Obama, only to have their status imperilled by his successor. Still others are asylum seekers from Central America, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, and elsewhere, who have fled gangs, climate crises, and armed conflicts, and then been misinformed or turned away by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers, some of whom have been emboldened under President Trump.\n\nIn the final moments before Laura crossed the bridge, she turned to Agent Garza. “When I am found dead,” she told him, “it will be on your conscience.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWhen Donald Trump announced his bid for the Presidency, he made anxieties about whiteness under siege a signature part of his platform. On the campaign trail, he promised to “deport all criminal aliens and save American lives.” After his Inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security created an office for the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, called *VOICE*{: .small}—Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. The office is compiling an online database to track “illegal alien perpetrators of crime.” (Data show that immigrants actually commit crimes at lower rates than U.S. citizens.) There is, however, no White House initiative to track a more sprawling set of legal violations involving immigrants—violations for which the U.S. government is largely responsible.\n\nIn the past decade, a growing number of immigrants fearing for their safety have come to the U.S., only to be sent back to their home countries—with the help of border agents, immigration judges, politicians, and U.S. voters—to violent deaths. Even as border apprehensions have dropped, the number of migrants coming to the U.S. because their lives are in danger has soared. According to the United Nations, since 2008 there has been a fivefold increase in asylum seekers just from Central America’s Northern Triangle—Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador—where organized gangs are dominant. In 2014, according to the U.N., Honduras had the world’s highest murder rate; El Salvador and Guatemala were close behind.\n\nPoliticians often invoke the prospect of death by deportation in debates about the fate of these immigrants and others with precarious status, like the Dreamers. In February, 2016, in a speech criticizing the lack of legal representation for Central American children seeking refuge, Harry Reid, at that time the Senate Minority Leader, warned Congress, “Deportation means death for some of these people.” That summer, Senator Edward J. Markey, of Massachusetts, told the press, “We should not be sending families back to situations where they can be killed.” He added, “That’s just un-American.”\n\nThese conversations have been largely theoretical, devoid of names and faces. No U.S. government body monitors the fate of deportees, and immigrant-aid groups typically lack the resources to document what happens to those who have been sent back. Fear of retribution keeps most grieving families from speaking publicly. In early 2016, as the director of the Global Migration Project, at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, I set out, with a dozen graduate students, to create a record of people who had been deported to their deaths or to other harms—a sort of shadow database of the one that the Trump Administration later compiled to track the crimes of “alien offenders.” We contacted more than two hundred local legal-aid organizations, domestic-violence shelters, and immigrants’-rights groups nationwide, as well as migrant shelters, humanitarian operations, law offices, and mortuaries across Central America. We spoke to families of the deceased. And we gathered the stories of immigrants who had endured other harms—including kidnapping, extortion, and sexual assault—as a result of deportations under Obama and Trump.\n\nAs the database grew to include more than sixty cases, patterns emerged. Often, immigrants or their families had warned U.S. officials that they were in danger if sent back. Ana Lopez, the mother of a twenty-year-old gay asylum seeker named Nelson Avila-Lopez, wrote a letter to the U.S. government during Christmas week in 2011, two months after Immigration and Customs Enforcement accidentally deported him to Honduras. Nelson had fled the country at seventeen, after receiving gang threats. He’d entered the U.S. unauthorized and been ordered removed, but an immigration judge then granted him an emergency stay of his deportation so that he could reopen his case for asylum. An *ICE*{: .small} agent told his family’s legal team that Nelson was deported because “someone screwed up,” and *ICE*{: .small} alleges that the proper office had not been notified of the judge’s stay.\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n[#image: /photos/5a4fba73dca26061e791f9fb]|||\n|||\n+++\n\n“His life is in danger,” Ana Lopez wrote, begging U.S. authorities to reverse her son’s deportation. Her efforts proved fruitless. Two months later, Nelson died in a prison fire, along with more than three hundred and fifty other inmates. His lawyer told me that Nelson had been detained by the Honduran government without charges, in an anti-gang initiative. Survivors of the fire alleged that it was set intentionally, perhaps as an act of gang retaliation, and that the guards had done little to help the men as they screamed and burned to death in their cells.\n\nWe discovered, too, how minor missteps—a traffic violation or a workplace dispute—can turn lethal for unauthorized immigrants. At eighteen, Juan Carlos Coronilla-Guerrero was deported from Texas to Mexico. He later returned and settled in Buda, Texas, with his wife. He worked as a carpenter and raised three kids. In January, 2017, someone in his neighborhood reported him for a domestic dispute; police found him in possession of a quarter of a gram of marijuana.\n\nIn March, Coronilla went to the Travis County courthouse for what, before Trump’s election, would likely have been a quick misdemeanor hearing. Travis was a “sanctuary jurisdiction,” meaning that the sheriff there declined to honor most federal detention requests for undocumented individuals without a warrant or an allegation of a serious crime. But Trump, within days of his Inauguration, had ordered a crackdown on sanctuary jurisdictions, and *ICE*{: .small} agents in Travis County had suddenly appeared in the courthouse. After Coronilla left his proceeding, his lawyer noticed two men who, he recalled, were “dressed like hunters.” The men followed Coronilla into an elevator, then identified themselves as *ICE*{: .small} agents and arrested him for reëntry after deportation, a felony.\n\nCoronilla’s wife begged a federal judge to spare her husband. Gangs had overrun his home town in Mexico, and deportees were prime targets for crime, since they were presumed to have money. Coronilla was deported in June. Three months later, gunmen woke him from the bed where he slept with his young son. According to the Austin [_American-Statesman_](http://www.mystatesman.com/news/immigrant-taken-ice-from-austin-courthouse-was-killed-mexico/bfntga0HYA378iitM4VT8J/), he tried to soothe the boy, saying, “Don’t worry, my love.” His body was found about forty miles away, filled with bullets. When I spoke to Coronilla’s wife shortly after his death, she told me that she’d returned to Mexico to claim his body. She now fears for her own life. “He was a good man,” she said. “Now I have to prepare for his funeral.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn the years following the Second World War, the United Nations established a principle of international law known as non-refoulement, or non-return, which forbids the removal of asylum seekers to countries where they are likely to be tortured or killed. The principle was enshrined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, formalizing the concept of the “refugee” and insuring safe harbor for people who could show “a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.” No one with a credible fear of persecution could be expelled “in any manner whatsoever to a territory where he or she fears threats to life or freedom.”\n\nFor the U.S., the effort to protect refugees was also an act of atonement. In 1939, the government had rejected a boat carrying more than nine hundred Jewish escapees from Nazi Germany. At least two hundred of them were later killed in the Holocaust. As the refugee crisis worsened, countless more were refused entry. President Franklin Roosevelt had warned the public that Jews posed a national-security threat, and argued for tighter restrictions on their numbers. “In some of the other countries that refugees out of Germany have gone to, especially Jewish refugees, they found a number of definitely proven spies,” he said at a press conference. Among those denied entry was Anne Frank, whose father applied for refugee status for his family in 1941, unsuccessfully. “What is done cannot be undone,” Anne [wrote in her diary](https://www.amazon.com/Anne-Frank-Diary-Young-Girl/dp/0553296981/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1515427818&sr=8-1&keywords=diary%20of%20anne%20frank), “but one can prevent it happening again.” She later died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\n\nIn 1980, Congress incorporated the idea of non-refoulement into the Refugee Act. The act established protocols for vetting and resettling refugees and assured asylum seekers that they would not be treated as criminals, even if they arrived unauthorized in the U.S. The act, which had bipartisan support, was also meant to bolster relationships with allies and to provide a humanitarian model of resettlement for the rest of the world.\n\nToday, the first screening of asylum seekers at the border often falls to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers, who attempt to separate out candidates for asylum and other forms of protection. Many agents treat the task with great care. In the Rio Grande Valley, in Texas, several told me that they view the work of identifying individuals who may have fled serious harm as one of the most rewarding parts of their job.\n\nA field manual for C.B.P. agents lists a series of questions that agents must ask an unauthorized immigrant before subjecting him or her to immediate deportation. “Do you have any fear or concern about being returned to your home country or being removed from the United States?” one reads. “Would you be harmed if you were returned?” another asks. C.B.P. agents are not authorized to evaluate the validity of the fear expressed. Instead, anyone answering yes to these questions must be referred to an asylum officer from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and given a chance to explain his or her fear. “The inspector should err on the side of caution,” the field manual reads, and “apply the criteria generously.”\n\nNevertheless, my team and I heard stories from more than a dozen women who say that they were never asked the required questions, or were ignored, mocked, or even sexually propositioned by U.S. agents after expressing their fears—and then deported to harm. In Queens, we met Rosaleda, who had worked as a police officer in Comayagua, Honduras, until her investigation of a cousin’s murder revealed a high-ranking colleague’s involvement in the crime, which Rosaleda reported to the department. Menacing phone calls began, followed by a drive-by shooting while she worked the overnight shift. “This is a warning,” read a note bearing her name that was left at the scene. “Leave things alone or we will kill you and next time we won’t miss.” Rosaleda asked a supervisor to transfer her; he said he’d consider it only in exchange for sex. In a second attempt on her life, while she was on patrol, two of her colleagues were killed. Rosaleda decided to risk the journey north. Her situation is surprisingly common, in some ways. In a recent study conducted by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, ten per cent of the women interviewed, who had fled El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, or Mexico, indicated that “the police or other authorities were the direct source of their harm.”\n\nWhen Rosaleda arrived in Texas, she was apprehended and deported without seeing a judge or a lawyer. She hadn’t shared details of her escape from Honduras, fearing that it would further endanger her. She attempted to cross the border again, and was kidnapped by a cartel and held for ransom. Eventually, she made it to New York, where she found pro-bono legal help. But, because of her earlier—and, her attorney argues, unlawful—deportation, she is now ineligible for asylum. (She was granted a “withholding of removal,” which has allowed her to remain in the U.S. but offers no path to permanent legal status.)\n\n[#cneembed: script/video/5a4d54392d1ca0573700000f.js?autoplay=0]|||\n\nMen and women gather their personal belongings and are escorted across the McAllen-Hidalgo International Bridge.\n|||\n\nAllegations abound of Customs and Border Protection officers dismissing asylum seekers more brazenly. According to a 2014 American Civil Liberties Union report based on conversations with nearly a hundred people who were removed without seeing an immigration judge, “Fifty-five percent said they were not asked about fear of persecution or torture,” while “forty percent who were asked and said they were afraid were ordered deported without seeing an asylum officer.” For years, the bipartisan U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has documented Customs and Border Protection’s noncompliance with asylum-seeker protections, including, in more than fifty per cent of cases, officers at ports of entry neglecting “to read the required information.” More recently, after Trump’s election, civil-liberties groups began documenting an apparent increase in rejections in some places on the border. According to a recent lawsuit, C.B.P. officers have told prospective asylum seekers, “The United States is not giving asylum anymore,” and “Trump says we don’t have to let you in.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn the night Laura was sent back across the McAllen-Hidalgo International Bridge, her mother, Maria, put her grandkids to sleep and lay down on Laura’s bed. Lately, she’d been helping Laura with childcare. After her daughter got back from her waitressing shift, she would often get into bed next to her mom and tell stories from her day before falling asleep. When Maria noticed, around sunrise, that her daughter hadn’t returned, she began to worry.\n\nMaria had raised Laura and her brother as a single mother while working at a Black & Decker plant in Reynosa, on the assembly line. She’d also done a stint at a laundromat, where Laura kept her company. Laura grew into a mischievous preteen. Once, she riled her brother by shaving off half his mustache while he was sleeping. At eighteen, Laura started seeing Sergio, who lived on her grandmother’s block. Sergio had a buzz cut, a square jaw, and an awkward sense of humor. He and Laura talked on the phone for hours, until Maria complained, “My phone bill—it’s a whole year’s salary!” Sergio had Laura’s name tattooed on his arm. After a year, Laura, who had a son from a previous relationship, gave birth to their first child. When Sergio later moved to Texas to work in construction with his father, Laura joined him. In 2007, the couple had another boy. Laura found work as a waitress and sold homemade candied apples door-to-door, while also taking care of the children. They were a handful, and, Maria recalled, “her partner was like a fourth child.”\n\nMaria told me that Sergio had been abused as a child and had struggled with addiction. “He came from a tough psychological background,” Laura’s brother said. One time, Maria told me, Sergio dragged Laura across the floor by her hair. Another day, in March, 2008, when Laura said she was going to leave Sergio, he grabbed a knife and threatened to commit suicide. As Laura protested, he shoved her to the floor and kicked her in the ribs. He beat her so badly that she called the police and prepared to file charges against him. A judge signed an emergency protection order forbidding Sergio from going within two hundred yards of Laura’s home, but the order seemed only to enrage Sergio. After multiple threats against Laura, he was arrested, charged with assault, and deported to Mexico.\n\nIn the years since Laura and Sergio had left Reynosa, the town had become a cartel battleground. In 2008, at least five thousand Mexicans died in the drug war, more fatalities than the United States suffered during the Iraq War. That year, a drug kingpin was captured in a shoot-out near Laura’s childhood home, and the military seized five hundred and forty rifles, a hundred and sixty-five grenades, and fourteen sticks of TNT. A turf war began, to determine his replacement. After Sergio returned to Reynosa, he reportedly started working as a cartel grunt. Maria told me that he continued to threaten Laura, saying that if she ever returned to Mexico he’d set her on fire, and texting, “I’m going to smoke you.”\n\nOn that Tuesday morning in June when Laura didn’t come home from her waitressing shift, Maria considered the dark possibilities right away. Then the phone rang. It was Laura, from Reynosa. “I did everything I could,” she said, crying. “I even told the police, ‘Arrest me, and I’ll show you the documents,’ ” referring to the emergency protection order.\n\nLaura called Elizabeth, too, and the cousins made a plan to meet in Reynosa. Elizabeth, trying to lighten the mood, asked whether the border agent who deported Laura was cute. Laura said that he was, and Elizabeth asked if she had tried to flirt. Laura replied, “I told him, ‘You’re sending me straight to the slaughterhouse.’ ”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFor years, most undocumented immigrants facing deportation in the U.S. were given a chance to go before a judge—to show evidence, call witnesses, and make a case for why they should be allowed to stay. In 1996, Congress revoked that right for tens of thousands of immigrants, expanding forms of “summary removal,” which can take place without a hearing or judicial input. By 2013, more than eighty per cent of deportations were nonjudicial, with the result that life-or-death decisions now routinely rest in the hands of immigration authorities at the border.\n\nEven when asylum seekers get the opportunity to see a judge, it can be difficult to prove that their fears merit legal relief. Asylum seekers aren’t entitled to lawyers, and children as young as three have been told to represent themselves in immigration court. According to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, at Syracuse University, asylum seekers who find legal representation are five times more likely to win their cases. Geography is a strong determining factor in their fates. When the Government Accountability Office studied the outcomes of asylum cases in courts nationwide, it found significant geographical disparities in the responses to nearly identical situations. Between 2007 and 2014, some sixty per cent of asylum applicants won their cases in New York City, while in the courts of Omaha and Atlanta less than five per cent did.\n\nPerhaps the most formidable challenge for asylum seekers is that the Second World War-era categories of protection aren’t well suited to immigrants fleeing modern gang violence. Courts resist recognizing the asylum claims of people who have been targeted by MS-13, for instance, because the motive for violence rarely fits the criteria. For victims of domestic violence, the legal protections, including the Violence Against Women Act, are slightly more favorable. If Laura had gone before a judge, she could have had multiple options for potential relief, including a U visa, for crime victims. Still, the legal scholar Blaine Bookey writes, “Whether a woman fleeing domestic violence will receive protection in the United States seems to depend not on the consistent application of objective principles, but rather on the view of her individual judge, often untethered to any legal principles at all.”\n\nNot long ago, I met a young mother who asked to be identified by her middle name, Elena. In Honduras, where she grew up, her teen-age brother was murdered by MS-13 for being gay, another brother was killed for refusing to join the gang, and her sister was shot for ignoring a gang leader’s sexual advances after he’d raped and impregnated her. A different gang member began pursuing Elena, and fired shots at her house after she turned him down. She reported the crime to police, and then learned that he was planning further retaliation against her.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5a4fec55ac1be64326ad89d8]||||||\n+++\n\nIn 2012, Elena crossed the U.S. border near Eagle Pass, Texas, and told a Border Patrol agent that she feared for her life. He logged her possessions: a black sweater, a hairband, gray shoelaces, and a key chain with photographs of her two children, whom she’d left behind in Honduras. He asked, “Would you be harmed if you are returned to your home country?” He wrote down a single word: “No.”\n\nIn detention, Elena fought back against this supposed denial, and won a hearing with an asylum officer, who corrected the record. Here she encountered a new obstacle. After she related her experiences, the officer asked her whether she was persecuted on account of her race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group—the refugee criteria created by the United Nations to reflect the political threats of 1951\\. Elena answered no on all counts, and the officer determined that she did not qualify to apply for asylum.\n\nElena appealed, requesting a hearing with a judge. Asking to go before an immigration judge often means a long stint in detention, and detention can mean poor food, minimal medical care, and scant access to legal counsel. In the past, federal policy has encouraged releasing asylum seekers while they await court hearings, sparing taxpayers the cost of detention. But in the last year of Obama’s Presidency, and then under Trump, the percentage of asylum seekers who were granted parole plummeted. Government data obtained in a civil-rights lawsuit showed that, in one New York facility, fifty per cent of parole requests were granted in the months immediately before Trump’s Inauguration. In the months after, twelve per cent were.\n\nAfter three months in detention, Elena was granted a rare hearing before an immigration judge. The hearing took place virtually, with the judge appearing on a video monitor. He asked Elena one question.\n\n“Did you move to any other city in Honduras before coming to the United States?” he inquired.\n\n“No,” she said.\n\n“Well, the government of the United States doesn’t afford you protection for this type of reason. I affirm the asylum officer’s decision. Nothing further.” Elena was deported two weeks later.\n\nBack in her home town, Elena was assaulted at gunpoint by the man she’d fled. He tortured her, holding a lighter to her skin. Other gang members cracked her thirteen-year-old son’s skull. She fled, with her kids, to a tobacco-farming town in western Honduras, where the man who’d been pursuing her found her again. Once more, she escaped to the U.S. This time, authorities agreed that Elena’s fear—and the threat to her kids’ lives—was credible. But, like Rosaleda, she is barred from receiving asylum because of her prior deportation.\n\nMany immigrants, after being deported, never get a second chance to prove their claims. Constantino Morales was a cop in Guerrero, Mexico, until he tried to break up a drug cartel and became a target of violence. He escaped to the U.S. and worked at a Cheesecake Factory in Des Moines, Iowa, and then became a popular laborers’-rights advocate. As with Laura, a minor traffic stop led to his removal, which he initially fought. At a community meeting with Tom Latham, at that time a Republican congressman, Morales said, “If I am sent back, I will face more violence, and I could lose my life.” Morales had applied for asylum a month earlier. He was denied. At the time, the U.S. State Department called Guerrero “the most violent state in Mexico.” Seven months after Morales’s deportation, he was shot and killed.\n\nIn October, Attorney General Jeff Sessions decried the “rampant abuse and fraud” in the asylum system and said that “the system is being gamed.” The Trump Administration has called on Congress to crack down, which federal immigration judges may be doing already. For the past several years, asylum grant rates have declined. In 2017, judges rejected some sixty per cent of asylum seekers, the highest denial rate in more than a decade.\n\nProtections have also evaporated for many refugees seeking resettlement in the U.S. Trump has portrayed refugees from countries such as Syria, Iraq, and Somalia not as candidates for humanitarian assistance but as national-security threats. In his first days in office, he banned many of them from travelling to the U.S. The ban is being contested in ongoing litigation. Several asylum and refugee officers told me they worry that the ban, and the inflamed discourse about refugees more generally, misrepresents their highly comprehensive vetting process, and undermines core American values.\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5a4fed41dca26061e791fa0a]|||\n|||\n+++\n\n“We have a great mission characterized by extreme caution and care,” Michael Knowles, a U.S. asylum officer for the past twenty-five years, told me, speaking as the president of Council 119, a union representing refugee and asylum officers and other staff of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. “Ours is a dual mission—to identify people who aren’t refugees and who, worst case, might wish us harm, but also to identify and protect refugees.” At a meeting in March, 2017, with John Kelly, the Secretary of Homeland Security at the time, Knowles warned that asylum and refugee officers are “deeply concerned” about the future of the program. Knowles told me what he wished he could have said to Kelly: “You’ve already unshackled Border Patrol. Please, don’t put the shackles on us.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn the hours after Laura’s deportation, Elizabeth drove across the border to meet her. “Ay,” Laura joked, after Elizabeth arrived at her grandmother’s house, in Reynosa. “What’s going to happen to my birthday party?” Maria and the kids came soon afterward, and they set up an inflatable pool in the back yard so that the boys could play while the adults discussed what to do.\n\nSergio soon learned of Laura’s return. He began driving by the house, shouting obscenities. A few days after her arrival in Mexico, Laura went to the pharmacy with Elizabeth and her youngest child. As she pulled the car out of the driveway, another vehicle T-boned her, blocking her exit. Sergio leaped out of the car and dragged Laura from her seat through the window, shouting, “You bitch!” He bit off a chunk of her ear and tried to strangle her, as their child cried in the back seat. Elizabeth grabbed a fallen tree branch and hit Sergio on the head. He stumbled, muttering, “You better not get involved.”\n\n“I’m calling the cops,” Elizabeth told him, flipping open her phone. The gesture was a ruse—her U.S. cell phone didn’t work in Mexico, and, anyway, the local police were known to collaborate with the cartels. But it worked. Sergio staggered back to his car and drove off.\n\nThe incident gave the cousins new urgency. Elizabeth emptied a coffee can and wrote “Help bring Laura back!” on it. She took it to friends and family members, asking for money to pay a coyote to smuggle Laura into the U.S. Laura’s trailer in Texas was only a twenty-minute drive from Reynosa, but it would take hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars, and a risky crossing, to get her there.\n\nThe next day, Laura left the house in her mother’s Ford Contour to buy food for the kids. By evening, she had not returned. “We called the Red Cross, we called the hospitals, we called the police,” Elizabeth said. The following morning, Maria turned on the local news, and a grisly image flashed across the screen. It was an incinerated vehicle, with a charred human skeleton in the front seat. The car was a Ford Contour.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nSergio seems like the kind of immigrant few Americans would object to deporting. In speeches, Trump has often warned the country about “bad hombres,” emphasizing the spectre of violent men to justify his deportation policies. Obama, whose Administration deported more immigrants than any other, also divided undocumented immigrants into neat categories: the longtimers versus the newcomers, those keen to “get right with the law” versus those trying to skate beneath it. “We’re going to keep focussing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security,” he promised, in 2014\\. “Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who’s working hard to provide for her kids.”\n\nBut even some immigrants who have committed felonies or other crimes have stories that are more complicated than they first appear. At a law office in San Francisco, I met the surviving family members of a woman named Yadira. She’d come to California from La Lima, Honduras, in the early two-thousands, to escape an abusive boyfriend. In 2010, she was deported on a drug-possession charge, despite articulating her fear of return. After she was back in La Lima, her brother, who was confined to a wheelchair, was murdered by the Mara 18 gang. (He had left a competing gang more than a decade earlier, after being shot and paralyzed.) Together with her grandparents, Yadira’s fourteen-year-old daughter discovered his body. Yadira began speaking out publicly against the gang, and became a target. Afraid for her life, she went north, hoping to get back to San Francisco.\n\nAt the U.S. border, she told officials about her brother’s murder but was detained nevertheless. “They’re going to deport me,” she told her father, in a call from detention, saying that she had begged for protection. (The C.B.P. stated that Yadira “did not claim fear of persecution.”) She stepped off the tarmac in Honduras wearing her favorite “California” sweatpants, hoping to go unnoticed. Her father, a trucker for Chiquita bananas, drove her home. A few days later, her youngest daughter found her body in front of the house, riddled with bullets.\n\nUnder Trump, *ICE*{: .small} arrests of undocumented immigrants—including those accused, but not convicted, of minor crimes—have gone up by nearly forty per cent. Trump describes these roundups to the electorate as a public-safety measure, but many law-enforcement leaders argue that they can have the opposite effect, lowering the rate at which crimes are reported. In February, a group of sixty law-enforcement officials warned, in a letter to Congress, that Trump’s policies “could harm community trust and make it harder for state and local law enforcement agencies to do our jobs.” In March, Los Angeles’s police chief noted that reports of sexual assault among the city’s Latino population had declined twenty-five per cent in the first three months of 2017, Trump’s first months in office. Domestic-violence reports dropped ten per cent. (The decline was not found among other ethnic groups.) In April, Houston’s police chief noted that the number of Hispanics reporting rape was down more than forty per cent.\n\nMy team and I filed public-record requests in the twenty U.S. cities with the highest populations of undocumented immigrants, in order to determine the extent of this change. We obtained sexual-assault and domestic-violence reports from heavily Hispanic neighborhoods, and contacted more than a hundred police departments, district attorneys, legal-services providers, and domestic-violence shelters.\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n[#image: /photos/5a4fec553f368d57da384d79]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nThe results were striking. In Arlington, Virginia, domestic-assault reports in one Hispanic neighborhood dropped more than eighty-five per cent in the first eight months after Trump’s Inauguration, compared with the same period the previous year. Reports of rape and sexual assault fell seventy-five per cent. Meanwhile, in Chicago, domestic-incident and sexual-assault reports from Hispanic victims dropped seven per cent. In Denver, the city attorney, Kristin Bronson, told us of more than a dozen Latina women who had dropped their domestic-abuse cases since Trump took office, citing fear of deportation. She estimates that the number of women who have avoided pursuing legal action against an abuser is far higher.\n\nMany local law-enforcement officers are also concerned about state-based legislation, including bills requiring local cops to act as subsidiaries of *ICE*{: .small}. A Texas law called SB4, known as the “show me your papers” law, threatens to jail or fine sheriffs who don’t coöperate with immigration holds. The law, which was supposed to go into effect in September but is in litigation, would make routine the process by which Laura was turned over to Border Patrol. Last July, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, a group of police chiefs and sheriffs representing dozens of large cities, joined with two other groups condemning SB4, warning the court that the law “will dangerously impact local communities by eliminating law enforcement discretion of how to effectively serve public safety needs.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn June 17, 2009, a week after Laura’s return to Reynosa, a coroner confirmed that her DNA had been found in the Ford Contour, and the police delivered her remains to Maria. The next day was Laura’s twenty-third birthday, and Elizabeth kept her promise to throw a party. She and Maria got balloons, prepared a cake, and hired a mariachi band. The birthday also served as a burial. At the gravesite, Laura’s family called her Texas friends on video chat. Laura’s eldest son brought his mother a gift, a figurine of his favorite cartoon character, and placed it in the coffin.\n\nThat week, Sergio was arrested by the Mexican police and confessed to Laura’s murder. He’d strangled her, according to the local press, then doused her in gasoline and set her on fire. Maria and Elizabeth testified at his trial. He was sentenced to forty years in prison.\n\nGrief, for Maria, was soon subsumed by the challenge of caring for Laura’s sons. A teacher called her to complain that one of the boys had told his class that his dad had killed his mom. “He cannot do that!” the teacher said. Maria told her, “He’s a child, and he’s in pain.” One day, Laura’s middle child Googled his mother and discovered disturbing details about her murder. He threw a fit, smashing furniture and crying, “I don’t want to be here without my mom!” At home, the youngest boy asked his grandmother, “Can you make her again, so that I can see her?”\n\nI went to Texas to meet Maria, and she welcomed me into her darkened apartment wearing black. She had the same deep-set eyes and velvety brows as her daughter, whose photograph hung above an overstuffed couch. “What I’m most proud of is what she left me—my grandsons,” Maria said, as she made coffee, gesturing toward the boys’ grade-school portraits in the living room. She added, “There’s a reason they’re alive.”\n\nShe showed me a cigar box on a shelf by the front door, the boys’ Mom Box. “If they find something girly outside, they bring it home and put it in the box,” Maria said. We looked through the contents: pink ribbons, a Disney Birthday Princess pin, a Mr. Potato Head ring, a Peter Pan figurine, and assorted trinkets that reminded the boys of Laura. Underneath was a copy of Laura’s emergency protection order, carefully folded.\n\nWhen Maria realized that the boys would soon be home from school, she told me that there was one last thing she wanted to show me. “You know how usually, when you box up someone’s clothes, and then you take them out, they smell bad?” she asked. “Well, my daughter’s clothes, they don’t smell that way. They’re still fresh.” She went into the bedroom and returned with an armful of clothing. At her urging, I pressed my face into one of Laura’s red satin blouses. A gentle scent lingered—unobtrusive, vaguely floral, verging on nothingness. I found it strange, after so many hours spent searching for Laura, to find her here.\n\nMaria told me that shortly after Laura’s death she began encountering problems raising the boys. She wasn’t their legal guardian, and doctors wouldn’t allow her to make decisions about their medical care. Signing off on school activities and therapy dates was complicated. So, one day in 2013, she packed up the boys and took them to the law offices of Jennifer Harbury, a civil-rights attorney.\n\nHarbury told me that, in the meeting, the boys “were a wreck.” She explained, “The older one was rocking back and forth, and the middle child looked scared—crying and hyper and desperate—and the little one was very upset.” The whole family, Harbury said, showed “every sign of post-traumatic stress you can think of.”\n\nMaria told Harbury that she needed help getting custody of her grandsons, and then recounted the circumstances of Laura’s death. “When a woman is afraid,” Maria asked, “why can’t you give her the opportunity to show her documents, to show her evidence?”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5a4fec558e36b61b5d78fc4a]||||||\n+++\n\nHarbury was stunned. Her team could help Maria get custody of the kids, she said. But, as the pair discussed the case, another idea emerged: filing a lawsuit against agents of the Border Patrol.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nHarbury, who is sixty-six, has made a career of challenging alleged abuses of immigrants, including refoulements. She grew up in Connecticut and California, in a family that had fled Nazi persecution in Holland during the Second World War. After graduating from Harvard Law School, in 1978, she moved to the Rio Grande Valley to defend farmworkers’ rights. In the early eighties, she noticed an alarming trend: thousands of Salvadorans and indigenous Guatemalans were crossing the Rio Grande, fleeing civil wars. Most were denied asylum and forced to return—often, she said, “to face torture chambers and death squads,” some of which were funded in part by the U.S. government.\n\nIn 1990, Harbury went to Guatemala to conduct research on indigenous women rebels fighting in the country’s civil war. Atop a volcano, she met a young Mayan rebel commander, Efraín Bámaca Velásquez, who went by the war name Everardo. They fell in love and travelled back to rural Texas, where they married and, in the tradition of leftist guerrilla fighters, exchanged silver spoons. A few months later, with Harbury’s support, Bámaca returned home to fight the Guatemalan Army. Then he disappeared.\n\nAt first, the Army claimed that Bámaca had been killed in combat. But Harbury grew suspicious when she reviewed the autopsy report. “Everardo was a walking war museum,” she said, explaining that he was covered in scars—and yet the report noted none of them. Later, a rebel fighter who had been captured by the Army escaped, and claimed to have seen Bámaca alive, being tortured on a Guatemalan military base.\n\nHarbury began a series of hunger strikes, sleeping on the pavement in front of Guatemala’s Presidential palace for thirty-two days, demanding answers. She attracted the attention of U.S. news shows and celebrities like Bianca Jagger and Charlie Rose. “If you kill him, I’m going to die on your doorstep with convulsions in front of every camera in the world,” Harbury said, addressing the Guatemalan government. “You’re going to be seen.” CBS reported that the C.I.A. knew that Bámaca had been captured alive and tortured, and Harbury moved her hunger strike to the gates of the White House. On the twelfth day of her fast, the congressman Robert G. Torricelli revealed that a Guatemalan Army colonel being paid by the C.I.A. had been involved in Bámaca’s torture, as well as in the earlier killing of a U.S. citizen, in 1990\\. President Clinton’s Administration ordered internal investigations into the United States’ role in the murders and their coverups.\n\nAlong the way, Harbury became something of a celebrity herself. The writer Chris Kraus centered part of her cult hit “[I Love Dick](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Dick-Semiotext-Native-Agents/dp/1584350342/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1515427995&sr=1-1&keywords=i%20love%20dick)” on her, describing Harbury’s pre-fasting aesthetic as “Hillary Clinton on a budget”—“a well-proportioned face with good WASP bones, blonde tousled bubble-cut, a cheap tweed coat, clear gaze”—and noting that, mid-fast, people looked at Harbury as “a strange animal.” Ted Turner bought the film rights to her life story, and a [_Times_ reporter](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/weekinreview/the-world-a-woman-s-obsession-pays-off-at-a-cost.html?pagewanted=all) suggested Madonna for the role, writing, “It would take a certain controlled irreverence and mad gusto to get Jennifer Harbury on the screen.”\n\nIn 1995, Bill Clinton suspended covert C.I.A. funding to the Guatemalan Army after the agency admitted to making mistakes in Bámaca’s case. To Harbury, this was far from sufficient. By then, she’d learned that her husband had been killed by men on the C.I.A.’s payroll. The next year, she sued officials from the State Department, the C.I.A., and other government bodies for denying her access to information that might have helped prevent her husband’s killing.\n\nThe case was filed as a “Bivens” claim, so called because of the case of Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, which, in 1971, established that citizens could sue federal officials if their rights had been violated. Harbury’s claim was simple: if the government hadn’t lied about her husband’s whereabouts, she could have petitioned for his rescue. Her case eventually went to the Supreme Court, where, in an unusual move, Harbury argued it herself. The Court acknowledged “appreciating Harbury’s anguish” but ruled against her.\n\nIn Maria’s story, Harbury saw a grief similar to her own, and a chance to hold the government accountable for another family’s anguish. “The U.S. government should not be free to submit people to torture and murder,” she said. “They did it in my husband’s case, and they did it in Laura’s case.”\n\nMaria worried about antagonizing the authorities, but she was desperate for ways to draw meaning from her daughter’s death. Recently, she had given Laura’s porcelain-doll collection to a center for abused girls. “In the case of my child,” she said, “there are many lessons that could be useful for other women.” Maria decided to press ahead with a lawsuit.\n\nThey had to work quickly, because the statute of limitations in Laura’s case had nearly expired. Harbury partnered with the Texas Civil Rights Project, a nonprofit that often pursues civil-rights cases on behalf of immigrants, and she was soon joined by one of the group’s attorneys, Efrén Olivares. On June 5, 2013, they filed Maria S. v. John Doe, on behalf of Laura’s three sons. U.S. immigration agents, they alleged, had arrested Laura, then “violated her procedural due process rights” and “refused to consider her clear eligibility for relief from removal.” Laura had the right to a full and fair hearing before a qualified immigration judge, and the right to counsel at her own expense, as afforded by the Fifth Amendment. Instead, the complaint claimed, agents had sent Laura back to “extreme danger, resulting in her battery and death.” Their decisions, the complaint said, “shock the conscience.”\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n[#image: /photos/5a4fec552bfe127294a8f3b4]|||\n|||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=\n\nHolding U.S. Customs and Border Protection legally accountable is difficult but not impossible. The day before Maria S. v. John Doe was filed, the A.C.L.U. brought a class-action case against officers from Border Patrol and *ICE*{: .small} in Southern California, alleging the widespread use of coercion, threats, and deception to get immigrants to sign their own expulsion orders, including a form called the I-826\\. In 2014, the Department of Homeland Security and other defendants agreed to a settlement. A long list of reforms resulted, including a stipulation that prospective deportees could use a phone to call a family member, a legal-service provider, or a Mexican consulate before removal. The reforms, however, applied only to Southern California.\n\nOther suits are pending. Last July, a nonprofit called Al Otro Lado sued officials at the Department of Homeland Security and at Customs and Border Protection, alleging that asylum seekers are being “systematically turned away at ports of entry.” Last year, the city of Chicago sued Trump’s Justice Department over a plan to withhold federal public-safety funds from sanctuary cities.\n\nHarbury has become involved in still more cases. After Trump’s election, she began interviewing recent deportees in Reynosa about their experiences with U.S. immigration authorities, and gathered accounts of asylum seekers who’d been kidnapped or otherwise harmed after being turned away. She compiled her findings in a sworn legal declaration, and shared it with a national network of civil-rights attorneys. In September, she filed a suit against officers from *ICE*{: .small} and other government entities on behalf of a group of “young civilians who were forced to flee their homelands due to the ongoing violence.” These asylum seekers had come from places as diverse as Ghana, Guatemala, and Sierra Leone, but faced the same “danger of severe persecution” if deported. Although they had committed no crimes, the suit alleged, they had been “wrongfully denied parole and subjected to prolonged and arbitrary detention in prison-like conditions.”\n\nThe case of Maria S. v. John Doe, filed on behalf of Laura’s kids, ended up on the docket of Judge Andrew Hanen, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, in Brownsville. His rulings on immigration are infamous. In 2015, he accused the Obama Administration’s Department of Homeland Security of “criminal conspiracy” after the agency chose not to arrest and deport an undocumented mother who had paid a smuggler to bring her child to the States. Hanen said that the decision set a “dangerous and unconscionable” precedent.\n\nGovernment lawyers argued for the dismissal of Maria’s suit, saying that U.S. Border Patrol agents enjoy wide immunity from civil lawsuits. It seemed likely that Hanen would side with the government, but, in 2015, in one of his first decisions in the case, he took a surprising position. He refused to dismiss the suit, writing, “Even aliens who have entered the United States unlawfully are assured the protections of the Fifth Amendment due process clause.” The case, he said, could move to discovery, which would have to focus on a single issue: whether, and how, Laura’s deportation had been coerced.\n\nAt a pretrial hearing of Maria S. v. John Doe, Hanen clarified this critical question. Laura, he noted, had signed an I-826 form in the hours before her removal, checking the box giving up her right to seek asylum, which reads, “I admit that I am in the United States illegally, and I believe I do not face harm if I return to my country.” Why? If Laura really feared for her life, had she signed under duress? Or did she check the box voluntarily?\n\nHarbury tracked down one of the friends who had been in the car that night. She was frightened but agreed to testify. While seated at the processing station, the woman recalled, Laura wept and begged the border officer—Ramiro Garza—not to send her back. The officer, she said, had a gun and an “annoyed” expression. He put the paperwork in front of Laura, and ordered her to sign. “This is an injustice!” Laura objected, according to the friend. Garza, she said, “mocked” Laura, and pressed again. The pair went back and forth until Laura caved. (Garza denied this version of events, and said that he would never force anyone to sign the form.) Laura’s friend said that her own decision to sign was influenced by the prospect of the long detention that often accompanies fighting deportation. “I didn’t want to be locked in,” she said, “because I have children.”\n\nIn July, 2017, Hanen finally handed down his ruling. “This case presents one of the most lamentable set of circumstances that this Court has ever been called upon to address,” Hanen wrote. It left the court with “a profound sense of sadness about the disastrous chain of events that ended in the defendant’s murder.” But he said that he couldn’t overcome the problem that “the only person who can truly reveal Laura S.’s motivation” in checking the box—Laura herself—“was killed.” As a result, coercion was hard to prove. Perhaps she was coerced, Hanen said, or perhaps she signed the I-826 so that she wouldn’t be in detention during her son’s surgery, or for some other unknown or unknowable reason.\n\n“Despite their best efforts,” Hanen ruled, “Plaintiffs have failed to clear the evidentiary hurdle created by the death of Laura S.” The case was dismissed.\n\nHarbury felt heartsick, but she’d always known that the case might have to wind its way through higher appeals courts. Last August, Harbury and the other lawyers filed with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the case should be heard by a jury. They noted that the lawsuit’s outcome “directly affects ongoing life and death situations” for other immigrants. Harbury is hopeful that, if success eludes them in the initial appeals, the case will eventually reach the Supreme Court. And if no justice emerges there? Harbury and her team will turn to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. There, they can draw on treaties meant to protect immigrants like those the United States failed in the Second World War.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFor Laura’s family, the stakes of the case are profound. But they also have other, more immediate worries. Not long after Laura’s murder, Elizabeth’s purse was stolen from her car. Her visa—her only proof of legal status—was inside. Then, in 2015, she learned about Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or *DACA*{: .small}, which was intended for people who had come to the U.S. as children and, in many cases, grown up here, who wanted to work legally, get an education, and stay in the place they considered home. Elizabeth decided to apply. She had to prove that she’d come to the U.S. before the age of sixteen, posed no threat to national security, and met a list of other criteria. Not long after submitting her materials, she was notified that she had won legal relief, and officially become a Dreamer.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5a5023f4787b6138da07f68c]||||||\n+++\n\nPolitically, Obama’s *DACA*{: .small} policies have been hugely popular. Recent polls show that more than three out of four Americans support allowing Dreamers to remain in the U.S., and two-thirds of Republicans back a pathway to citizenship for them. But, last September, Elizabeth got frightening news: Trump had ordered an end to the program, and had given Congress six months to extend its protections. Elizabeth had to submit a renewal request before an October deadline, but she couldn’t afford the legal fees. Her immigration attorney, she told me, refused to return her paperwork without a substantial payment.\n\nIn December, Elizabeth’s *DACA*{: .small} status expired. If a legislative solution isn’t reached by early March, nearly seven hundred thousand people in the U.S. will be stripped of their legal status and their protection from deportation. Earlier this month, three former Homeland Security Secretaries, including Michael Chertoff, who served under George W. Bush, wrote a letter to Congress underscoring the importance of a *DACA*{: .small} fix. “We write not only in strong support of this legislation, but to stress that it should be enacted speedily, in order to meet the significant administrative requirements of implementation, as well as the need to provide certainty for employers and these young people,” the letter read.\n\nSome Dreamers fear for their lives if sent back. Elizabeth testified against Sergio at his murder trial, and she told me that he has called her relatives in Reynosa from prison to make death threats against her. When she lost her legal status, she also lost her work permit, and therefore her job. Some days, anxiety overtakes her. “I’m still trying my best,” she recently texted me, “which is what matters.”\n\nStill, when I asked Elizabeth what she would tell President Trump if they ever met, she immediately thought of Laura’s boys. “Please be conscious of what happens when a woman gets deported,” she said. “It’s not only what could happen to her—it’s the family she leaves behind, in America. Please think of those kids.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAt home last summer, Laura’s boys celebrated what would have been their mother’s thirty-first birthday. Maria decorated a vanilla cake with fresh carnations and hung streamers from the ceiling in Laura’s favorite colors: purple, pink, and light blue. She gathered the family in the living room—the three boys and Elizabeth, as well as aunts and uncles and cousins—and handed out pens. Each person wrote a message to Laura on a piece of notebook paper, which they tied to pink balloons and launched into the sky.\n\n“Hi, _mami_,” Laura’s youngest wrote, in Spanish. “I miss you.” He said that he hoped to have four careers—as “a basketball player, a Nascar driver, an engineer, and a YouTuber”—so that he could send his earnings to his mom in Heaven, after buying himself a “fancy refrigerator.”\n\nThe oldest boy told me of his plans to persuade the rapper Drake to adopt him. He loved Drake’s music, and his style, and his Instagram feed, and he knew Drake would love his, too. “Hey, Mom,” he wrote. “I need you to take care of me.”\n\nLaura’s middle child kept his note secret, but he showed me a poster board he’d made for his mother, with colorful pompoms and photographs glued above a poem he’d written: “Wave after wave / Crushes onto my legs / I remember Mom’s every word / To help me stand on my own two feet.”\n\nAt the kitchen table, the boys played with an iPhone. “Siri, what is ten to the thousandth?” the youngest asked. “Siri, who am I?”\n\n“Who is my mommy?”\n\n“Who is Donald Trump?”\n\n“How old is Donald Trump?”\n\nThe oldest chimed in, “Siri, can I call my mom?”\n\nMaria sometimes envies the boys’ approach to death. She told me that twice Laura’s eldest son had stood at the bus stop after school, craning his neck, waiting. “What is it?” she asked.\n\n“When is Mom coming?” he replied.\n\n“Mom’s not coming,” she told her grandson. “Remember where we left her?” she asked gently, pulling him close. “We left her on the other side of the border.” ♦\n\n*This story was produced in collaboration with the Global Migration Project, at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism.
