    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden" ><p>A realistic concern for recreational users of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/cannabismarijuana" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at marijuana">marijuana</a> is whether or not they will become addicted. There are no easy answers to this question. In my opinion, the most unbiased book on this and other related topics is The Science of Marijuana (2008). The Science of Marijuana is written by Leslie L. Iverson, a professor of pharmacology at the University of Cambridge in England. In the book, he reviews decades of international research on marijuana, both laboratory research and survey research. Based on his review of the scientific literature, between 10 to 30% of regular users will develop dependency. Only about 9% will have a serious <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at addiction">addiction</a>. For an excellent post on the biology of marijuana addiction see <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/all-about-addiction/201001/is-marijuana-addictive-you-can-bet-your-heroin">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-addiction/201001/is-marijuana-addictive-you-can-bet-your-heroin</a></p><p>The large majority of people who try marijuana do it experimentally and never become addicted. Unlike other substances, pot has very few severe withdrawal symptoms and most people can quit rather easily. When present, withdrawal symptoms might include: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at anxiety">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at depression">depression</a>, nausea, sleep disturbances and GI problems.</p><p>Compared to other substances, marijuana is not very addicting. It is estimated that 32% of tobacco users will become addicted, 23% of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/opioids" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at heroin">heroin</a> users, 17% of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/cocaine-use-disorder" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at cocaine">cocaine</a> users, and 15% of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/alcohol" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at alcohol">alcohol</a> users. Cocaine and heroin are more physically harmful and nicotine is much more addictive. It is much harder to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/smoking" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at quit smoking">quit smoking</a> <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/nicotine" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at cigarettes">cigarettes</a> than it is to quit smoking pot.</p><p>Recreational users of the past are often compared to todays smokers.  The smokers, the times and the pot are all different. According to Iversen, marijuana became widely used in the US during the 1960s by Vietnam vets. This was a time of social upheaval and strong anti-war sentiment. Youth were rebellious and experimental pot smokers. Today's youth are different. They are mainstream. Interestingly, many of today's young smokers are children of the previous generation of smokers. And, my generation of marijuana smokers quit relatively easily when they became <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/parenting" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at parents">parents</a> and homeowners.</p><p>It is often said that today's pot is stronger. I am not sure how anybody could know this. Readers, if you know please tell me. Are there studies comparing THC content of 1970 pot with 2010 pot? How could this even be possible on a large scale? Does somebody still have some 1970 pot sitting around or are we relying on old <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/memory" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at memories">memories</a>? The only thing that I can surmise is that the marijuana that is carefully cultivated indoors these days is more potent than previous strains. In fact, this brings to mind one of my greatest frustrations. In California, small amounts of marijuana are legal for people with 215 cards but it is not regulated. So, how does anybody know how much THC they are smoking? Do they even know where it was grown and how much pesticide it contains? For example, when I buy Advil in the supermarket, I know that I am getting 200 mg capsules.</p><p>In spite of different strains of marijuana containing different amounts of THC, experienced smokers are able to control their high. An interesting study reported in Iversen's book claims that regular users know how to inhale in a way that regulates THC content. A study was conducted where experienced smokers were given joints with either 1% or 4% levels of THC. The subjects were blind to experimental conditions so they didn't know the THC content of the joint. Without knowing which joint they were smoking, the smokers automatically adjusted their inhaling to reach about the same degree of high and THC absorption. They did this by taking longer and harder draws on the weaker joint and breathing in more air with the more potent joint.</p><p>So, to wrap up, is marijuana addictive? For most people, no. About 10% of recreational users will develop problems serve enough to impair their work and relationships. Many more will come to depend on pot for relaxation and social purposes. This will be problematic if they don't learn more effective coping mechanisms and come to rely on marijuana instead of solving their problems. When ready, most people will be able to quit with only mild withdrawal symptoms. And, compared to other recreational <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychopharmacology" class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at drugs">drugs</a>, marijuana is relatively harmless. But, it is not completely harmless. And...what is more serious than its addictive consequences are the legal ones. This relatively harmless herbal plant is unregulated and illegal in the U.S.</p></div>

For example, your labeling alcohol as addictive among 15% of cases runs into some conceptual complications when contemplating the discussion of "Alcoholism isn't what it used to be" at the NIAAA Web site (or my modest article in the Sept. PT).</p>

You asked how anyone knows that today's pot is stronger than in 1970. Simple answer, only the leaves were smoked in 1970 and today, basically only the buds are smoked, which contain the highest levels of THC in the whole plant. THC is the psychoactive element in the pot plant. Also, you said you "know" that your Advil from the store has 200 mg of the active ingredient in each capsule. i believe you might want to say that you "believe" that each capsule has that amount in it, unless you have done laboratory tests on each capsule. You only believe what you are told by the pharmaceutical company who manufactures the Advil - you don't know. Anyway, nice article. Thanks. Tad</p>

No I am not a pot head, nor was I smoking marijuana at the time. The comment you made as to weather marijuana was stronger today, as it was in the 70s was what made me laugh.  During the 70's marijuana was genuine. It used to come from Mexico, so it was more potent. Today, it is home grown, which makes it less potent, therefore they (the users) have to add other substances such as cocaine, crack, or other dangerous chemicals in order for the user to get high. This I believe is what makes it addictive and more dangerous. Yes I was one of those users in the 70's, but when they started mixing it with crack cocaine, during the 80'd I quit with no problems.  Thank you for your article.</p>

This information comes from labs that tested the THC potency then and now. Also, home-grown marijuana is no less potent than that grow in indistrial grow houses. It strictly depends on the grow methods used. Also, who has told you uses mix the weed with other drugs?

      <div class="field field-name-comment-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden" ><p>Thanks for being open minded and looking at the honest scientific facts instead of blindly parroting the anti-marijuana propaganda promoted by our Government and many corporations that see marijuana as unwanted competition for their lower quality, often toxic and very often far more environmentally harmful products. </p>
<p>As a PhD, I’m sure you’re aware that about 10% of the population has an addictive personality and they’re going to get addicted to something over the course of their life, whether it be food, sex, marijuana or something else they like. It’s interesting to note that 10% or so of marijuana users are said to become addicted in almost every credible study. To me that says marijuana is not addictive at all but rather, human nature dictates that 10% of marijuana users, or users of any other substance they like, are going to get addicted. </p>
<p>Marijuana was actually introduced to the USA as a so called "recreational drug" at least as early as the beginning of the 1900’s by migrant Mexican farm workers, hence the earliest prohibition of marijuana being well documented as a racial tool against Mexicans. The first law prohibiting marijuana use as a drug was a little known 1913 CA law and marijuana was prohibited nationally in 1937. The earliest English settlers are well known to widely use hemp for a variety of purposes. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both grew hemp and the very first hemp law in the USA was actually a law requiring farmers to grow it. You could even pay your taxes with hemp in the early USA. The founders of this Country using marijuana as a recreational drug is not well documented but its early use as a medicine is. There was a document written by George Washington, in which he talked about separating his male and female hemp plants. Since the female plant, when denied pollination, provides the strongest THC content, it’s hard to imagine why he was separating female plants unless he was interested in using them as a drug.</p>
<p>The recent stronger THC content is most commonly documented by tests done by law enforcement over the last few decades using confiscated marijuana. Stronger THC content is often cited as meaning it is more dangerous, however nothing could be further from the truth. As you noted, marijuana consumers easily regulate the effects of marijuana they desire regardless of potency. Also, marijuana itself is nontoxic. Marijuana is kind of like coffee, once you get enough, you stop using it for a while. The only possibly toxic result of marijuana comes from the carcinogens produced when marijuana is burned. More potent pot equals SAFER pot because less smoke is inhaled. Marijuana can also be eaten, vaporized or made into tea, all of which completely eliminate the need to burn marijuana, although smoking it is the most common way it is consumed. It’s worth noting that many studies have shown NO increased risk of cancer or any other serious health risks even from smoking marijuana and that marijuana contains substances which have actually shown to inhibit (possibly prevent) cancer and many other ailments, hence its popularity as a safe effective medicine for a wide range of ailments both severe and mild.</p>
<p>I don’t think marijuana use actually causes people to develop problems serve enough to impair their work and relationships. Over many years I have seen hundreds of marijuana consumers in every walk of life from Dr.’s to construction workers to professional drivers use marijuana while working and I have never seen even one accident or truly harmful result. Marijuana seems to cause people to slow down a little and be a little more cautious but this most often results in safer and more efficient work, rather than any harms. That's most easily proven by many marijuana driving studies which show, unlike alcohol consumers, marijuana consumers are only SLIGHTLY impaired, they are aware they are slightly impaired and they slow down a little and are a little more cautious, resulting in absolutely no increased danger to their self or other drivers. The stigmatism of marijuana’s illegal status, the highly inflated cost of marijuana because of it being illegal and the harm from marijuana arrests all cause far more so called “marijuana related” negative effects than the use of marijuana itself.</p>
<p>In support of my positions I offer the following information:</p>
<p>Many government studies have cited the relative safety of marijuana but rather than base rational marijuana policy in science and facts, our government ignores science and facts and promotes lies and fear mongering. </p>
<p>On March 22, 1972 the Richard Nixon-appointed, 13-member National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse recommended the decriminalization of marijuana, concluding, “[Marijuana's] relative potential for harm to the vast majority of individual users and its actual impact on society does not justify a social policy designed to seek out and firmly punish those who use it.” Richard Nixon chose to ignore the advice of this well qualified, expensive, taxpayer funded commission and start the modern escalation of criminalizing marijuana consumers. The lies he promoted have done much harm but they served his selfish motives and got him re-elected based largely on him starting the “war on drugs”, a violent unconstitutional unnecessary war against nonviolent citizens, which are no threat to their selves or society and a war on everyone’s Constitutional rights. Google: Drug War Victims. </p>
<p>In 1988, after reviewing all scientific evidence brought forth in a lengthy lawsuit against the government’s prohibition of medical marijuana, the DEA’s own administrative law judge (Judge Francis Young) wrote: “MARIJUANA, IN ITS NATURAL FORM, IS ONE OF THE SAFEST THERAPEUTICALLY ACTIVE SUBSTANCES KNOWN. IN STRICT MEDICAL TERMS, MARIJUANA IS SAFER THAN MANY FOODS WE COMMONLY CONSUME.” </p>
<p>Anyone that wants marijuana is already getting it. Legalizing and rationally regulating marijuana based on its safety vs risks is not adding another harmful intoxicant to society, legalizing gives people the legal opportunity to make the SAFER CHOICE! Alcohol, tobacco, many Rx drugs, many over the counter drugs, even caffeine, aspirin and non-aspirin, can all be deadly and are well documented as being the direct cause of hundreds of thousands of deaths in the USA every year! http://www.saferchoice.org/content/view/24/53/ </p>
<p>No one, of any age, in all of recorded history, anywhere on planet earth, has ever died from the ingredients in marijuana and they never will, marijuana is nontoxic. Many have died from marijuana prohibition and tens of millions have been jailed or otherwise harmed. In the US we arrest someone on marijuana charges every 38 seconds. Marijuana charges account for roughly 50% of all drug arrests. Would you rather have your kid locked up with killers and child molesters or would you prefer to do your own proper parenting? </p>
<p>Watch this FL man that gets his marijuana from the Federal government destroy all the lies about marijuana consumers being lazy and unproductive. Watch him destroy all the lies about long term heavy marijuana use being harmful. Learn the truth about marijuana: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvzX8aNwxgM   </p>

It’s more like a library than a list!</p>
<p>The laws prohibiting marijuana are NOT a result of any harm from marijuana. They are the result of racism, lies and greed. Read the well documented proof of that and a lot more marijuana TRUTH in these two articles: “WHY IS MARIJUANA ILLEGAL, Pete Guither” and “MARIJUANA AND HEMP THE UNTOLD STORY, Thomas J. Bouril”, click the links to those articles on this webpage:<br />

<p>Why should the government ONLY allow use of a nontoxic natural plant "after exhausting all other options"? Why should a substance that is far SAFER than aspirin ONLY be legal for those that have a serious ailment? Why should people be forced to use FDA approved poisons instead of a far safer more effective natural plant? Why should a plant that is SAFER than potatoes be regulated and taxed as if it was as dangerous as alcohol? Eating a couple of raw potatoes can give you a toxic reaction but marijuana is nontoxic. Why should people have their kids taken away from them when nontoxic marijuana is found in their home while tobacco is legal and if a baby was to eat even one tobacco cigarette the nicotine in that 1 cigarette could be fatal?</p>
<p>Learn how and why marijuana became illegal, follow the money and it will all make sense, then speak up and demand marijuana legalization!</p>

<p>It's nice that you "think" this, but it clearly demonstrates that you are simply talking out your backside. My son, who is 16 years old, was introduced to marijuana two or three years ago.It has completely changed him. He was kid who was conscientious, considerate, intelligent and very expressive.After three years of use he has become a different person. He lies to everyone. He will tell you what he thinks you want to hear and then immediately engage in his next high. He is manipulative. He has become rude. He takes things that don't belong to him without asking. He picks on kids that he perceives as weak and/or uncool. My son was NONE of these things until he was introduced to marijuana use. The changes were gradual and remained in step with his increases in use. He smokes almost every day now and even keeps a vial on a lanyard around his neck for keeping his stash with him at all times. He is headed for rehab. Your assertions that this plant is not harmful are nothing more than your own wishful thinking. This "holy" plant turned my kid into an a$$hole.</p>

Perhaps the fact that he is 16-years-old and going through adolescent development is the reason why he has become an "a$$hole". There are thousands of middle aged-elderly marijuana users who have used the substance everyday for their entire lives. Many of these individuals are not only responsible, sincere, and respectful citizens, but they also maintain successful careers, families, and contribute to their communities. I am sorry for your troubles with your son, but please do your research before lashing out ignorant and poorly educated insults. Thank you.</p>

None of the issues you say that your son has is even remotely tied to marijuana. In all honesty, it sounds like your son is dealing with something emotionally (maybe even psychologically)that is going unaddressed. Instead of scapegoating the marijuana use, how about you talk to him and get to the real root of the problem. Picking on kids, being rude and manipulative, stealing etc... are not symptoms of marijuana use... Weed doesn't make you steal or lie. If he started drinking wine, would you have drawn the conclusion that wine makes him steal and lie? Probably not because that would be pretty illogical.</p>

Offer him a motivational reward (like money) if he passes a drug test after 40 days.  If he changes and turns his life around, your theory may have been correct. In any event, chances are he will not return to his old ways.   If he is still a jerk, you at least know you need to look elsewhere to help him.  It sounds like he needs help and it would be sad if you ignored other options because you believe it is caused solely by his Pot use.</p>

      <div class="field field-name-comment-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden" ><p>I had a very happy childhood, up until i started smoking (grade 8) I had straight A's and was on three sports teams a year and was generally considered a funny and nice kid.. Gradually my pot usage increased as the years went by.. I spent my summers in high school training basketball overseas and always came back a much better player but during the school year even though I had enjoyed some success I only got marginally better.. At the time I knew this was because of smoking weed, I knew that it made me lazy.. Playing with the best players in the city and touring the AAU circuit i was exposed to the best competitive amateur basketball North America had to offer.. I saw how hard my peers were working but I could never achieve that level of dedication because WEED MAKES (SOME) PEOPLE LAZY! My goal was to get a scholarship and I had all the physical gifts needed as well as the IQ and a knack for accuracy from long range.. The best coaches in the city believed in me at a certain point, some of the best players truly respected me.. One of the biggest mistakes I made was staying in the city to "train" my last two highschool summers.. I ended up partying a lot more than training and my addiction - still hiding from me - became worse.. A student-athlete is a student first and my marks had become abysmal.. no marks, no scholarship.. By the end of grade 12 it was obvious to everyone in the basketball sphere that I was no longer a product, my confidence on the court was shot and the same players I was once better than were playing 25 min + a game while I watched from left bench.. It only fueled my addiction, it was easier to rip a bowl and forget than to go to the gym and train a sport (that deep down i still loved) that was making me miserable.. The summer after grade 12 I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders, I gave up on basketball.. My addiction to marijuana hit new heights and I was fully immersed in the party pop culture.. Many fun nights, many memories, many things to make you forget about your problems.. I didnt even graduate, september rolls around and all my peers are going to University while I convinced my parents to enroll me in a "private" school (pay for my grades).. I attended the school with my best friend (who had a similar fate in his amateur sports career and saw similar aspirations evaporate because of weed).. We had learned nothing and smoked on a daily basis at that school and had an awesome time while we somehow magically recieved 90+ avgs. The following year I attended university to study chemical engineering (family of engineers) but my weed habits that year reached feverish heights.. the stress of school was something i was not mentally strong enough to handle and weed was my escape route more than ever.. other than some occasional strong performances on exams that i studied hard for, i had failed a lot.. by the end of that year I was put on 1 year mandatory absence from the program.. when that letter came in, once again just like with basketball i had said, "fuck it all" and started to smoke even more weed just to forget my failures.. You see, I have a certain image, tall, good-looking, model girlfriend, smart, funny, etc.. (not to toot my own horn, i just know this to be somewhat true) I am still waiting to get back into school and in my ethnic local community secrets cannot exist, everyone knows my problems now.. but my circle of friends still think i am studying engineering in my second year.. It is a horrible way to live and i agree with the mother about her 16 year old.. weed made me very manipulative and a compulsive liar.. let me correct that, as a kid I liked to lie needlessly just to see if I can get away with it, I knew it was wrong but I liked doing it.. Weed made it worse.. People who "know" me have this certain idea of me and it just isn't the true me, only a few people can say they know the real me.. Im not trying to say, "Weed made all my problems" because that is not true, I made my problems by choosing to smoke weed.. Now I torture myself with every decision I remember where instead of going to bed to wake up and train i went out and abused my parents trust by getting high, instead of going home to study I go to my friends apartment and rip bowls for 5 hours.. I am the tool here, I now have nothing except my family and (amazing) girlfriend.. I could be lightyears ahead of where I am (my brother is no longer Mr. Brother but Dr. Brother, my sister is on a similar path) but instead i am still very much struggling with weed addiction and in my basement typing this reply because i feel a strong urge to protect any other youngster from the same assumptions I heard about weed, the same assumptions you make.. FACT: teens make bad choices, FACT: teens may have an addictive personality (I do) FACT: weed CAN be addictive.. You are simply wrong and I am sadly right.. I have seen similar cases in pot culture time and time again.. its a drug thing and its sad that people profit from other people's demise.. but then again, we in North America with our cars and tvs and refrigerators benefit from the hunger and poverty of the rest of the world.. When there is demand, someone will supply and people will get exploited, whether it be the consumer or the labour and even the producer.. Capitalism at its finest, groups strongly advocating for their own wants.. The kids want weed, I just hope they realize they really don't want it before its too late</p>

  <div class="content">
      <div class="field field-name-comment-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden" ><p>First, sorry to be biting your head off. This is a relatively emotional topic for reasons you will read below. Also, the amount of small-mindedness people adopt when looking into the issues of marijuana is irritating. Don't</p>
<p>I can't speak for a 16 year old kid. What I can speak to though is that I am turning 30 in 2 months time. I have been smoking everyday pretty much for the past 5 years (have been smoking much longer, but have taken breaks for years at a time beforehand because I struggled with finding a middle-ground) with the exception of a 1 year break between mid-2011 and mid-2012. The reason for stopping was because it was ruining my life. And i didn't stop straight away. I spent 3 years spending all my "what-could-have-been-savings" on weed (smoking about 1 gram of chronic a day). I lost a lot of friends in the process because I became a recluse, stood still in my life (career didn't move forward, no new relationships), I was depressed, I knew that smoking was not moving my life forward in any way yet I found myself terrified at the thought of stopping smoking.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the year I stopped, after about 3 months I started finding the world interesting again. I started loving the mountains, rock climbing, being around people, being active and I started building relationships again. I then started smoking again about 6 months ago and I got straight back into the full time thing. My work has gone to shit over the past 6 months, my interests have dwindled impressively, and I find now that any activity I do is forced (oh, and the savings I had accumulated during the year of not smoking has started to be eroded) and have started falling back into depression. I have tried to stop probably 10 times since I started again yet for some reason I find myself going back to it (much like an addict would no?).</p>
<p>Anyway, one thing I have learned (admittedly I'm a smart guy so this may not make sense to some of you) is that people are different. And, at the same time, many people are the same. Hence, I believe that I am not alone (considering I have met many people through my smoking career that have been desperate to stop yet couldn't) and so that would suggest that many other people are, like me, addicted to marijuana.</p>
<p>I do appreciate though that many many people do not get addicted to the drug. But please, try not to be so publicly ignorant when you state that marijuana addiction is not real. You are welcome to argue with me and tell me I am not addicted. You would be wrong though. You clearly are not even assuming that you understand an addicts point of view, in which case, why are you even participating in the conversation. You are not doing it for the learning it seems...</p>

      <div class="field field-name-comment-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden" ><p>I agree with your post.  In my teens, I became daily user, and became a young adult smoking marijuana daily.  I didn't quit until well into my 30's and realized later (when I quit) that smoking marijuana daily kept me in a state of depression. I am an introverted person and marijuana made me more withdrawn.  Sure, I had some sort of social life based upon smoking, but when I quit, I had few friends because those friends I had when I was smoking, I knew only superficially and our relationship was based around pot culture (smoking pot, obtaining pot, etc). I wonder now what my 20's would've been like had I had real friends and not "pot friends."  To make matters worse, I barely remember my 20's and that time almost feels like "lost time."  These days when I smoke again, it tends to make me feel more withdrawn and I can tell it makes me slightly depressed.  Of course, I sometimes think of smoking when I have to do hard labor or exercise, but the mental repercussions aren't worth it.  Now that I'm not feeling depressed, I prefer to feel all of life.</p>

      <div class="field field-name-comment-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden" ><p>I had smoked pot for many years until about 5 years ago when it became difficult to get and I have met and known at least a couple hundred people that have smoked recreational pot for many years on and off. I have yet to see any of them addicted. Many of them have easily quit with no withdrawal symptoms that I am aware of. Most of them have become outstanding and productive citizens. Many of them still smoke recreational pot. I have talked to many of them about the possibility of addiction and we all tend to agree that they are not addicted and have stopped many times without any withdrawal symptoms. As far as draining the bank account that is certainly a problem but not because of the pot but instead of the fact that it is illegal which has driven the price through the roof. If you spend all of your money on pot then I would expect you would become depressed and reclusive. That is not the effect of pot but the result of our irrational laws making it illegal. After a hard weeks work I find it much more relaxing to smoke a joint in my own home not bothering anybody else instead of drinking alcohol and going out and killing somebody or suffering a terrible headache the next morning and possibly becoming addicted. I do not recommend that pot be smoked before going to work and depending on the THC/CBD ratio which will determine if the pot is hyper or sleeper it could have a impact on performance. Also, the more one smokes pot the less effect it has. If I have not smoked for a week or longer then I can get a pretty good buzz when I smoke again but if I continue to smoke the next day and so on then the high is considerably reduced and ineffective. Also, pot is the only drug that I have found that actually remedies my restless leg syndrome at night and I have tried all sorts of prescription and over-the-counter remedies to no effect.</p>

There are clinical case studies and real world case studies which I fall into the later. I know of at least a couple hundred marijuana users over the past 60 years of personal use and not one of them has become addicted ever. Not one of them has suffered any sort of negative affects. The only reason that any of them have been incarcerated or not been employed lucratively is because of the illegality and not effects of cannabis in itself. It's time to wake up and smell the pot and stop using it has an excuse for your failures.</p>

Did I mention he has been doing this for 3 years...every day? He's doing well, has a 3.6GPA (3rd year of college), and everyone he knows (including myself for a while) has no idea he's a regular smoker. Despite his dependency, he is just another good citizen. So I ask you, what harm comes from being a regular smoker? For that matter, if you're addicted to a substance but it harms you in no way and has no negative impact on your life what is the problem? Does addiction always have to be a problem?</p>

      <div class="field field-name-comment-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden" ><p>American pot wasn't as strong in the 60s and 70s because we didn't have traditional cultivation techniques and the strong varietals that you would encounter in Thailand, South Africa or India. The most potent blossoms presently would yield about 15-17% THC. My guess is that the best marijuana grown at that time would be the same.</p>
<p>Law enforcement is using scare tactics to demonize marijuana. It is not that much more potent now. The main advantage to growing hydroponically, for instance, is not the potency but the speed at which the plant grows when given optimal nutrition.</p>
<p>I have been using marijuana since my teenage years. In part, I was medicating a undiagnosed chronic unipolar depression. In my opinion, it had a neutral to slightly negative impact on my depression. Television, caffeine, poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle, alcohol, video games had a much more negative impact. </p>
<p>If you do use marijuana, use it in moderation. Don't use it as a crutch for your emotional problems. The real problem is that our culture provides a thousand crutches for the inevitable pain we encounter in life.</p>
<p>I use marijuana in such small amounts now that I don't think it alters my 'mind' but rather adjusts my mood, appetite and nausea to the same extent as a cup of coffee or a cigar. I use a vaporizer rather than smoking. I do think smoking anything is unhealthy.</p>

Its not just throwing a couple seeds in the ground and coming back months later to some nice pot. Certain lighting, dampness, and mixtures of different types of weed make a strong or weak plant. Growers are combining different marijuana strains to make new, stronger strains. Each year there is a competition in Amsterdam called the Cannabis Cup in which judges from all around the world can sample and vote for their favorite new strain. =]</p>

      <div class="field field-name-comment-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden" ><p>It is all too often that I hear people lay the claim that our understanding of genetics has so drastically improved that today's marijuana is undeniably stronger than it was twenty years ago. Frankly, this is rather hard to swallow. The fact of the matter is that there are records of recreational/medicinal marijuana use dating back as far as 2700 BCE, which means that the plant has been domesticated for nearly five thousand years (if not more). Furthermore, it grows very rapidly (approximately four months); just think about how much more information we have on evolution by studying microorganisms, as opposed to multi-cellular organisms. Why is this? It's simply because microorganisms have such short lifespans that we are able to witness evolution within a single lifetime. The same principle applies to marijuana: five thousand years, with about three harvests per year, means that human beings have had a LOT of time to figure out how to properly grow it. With this said, the notion that THC levels have magically tripled within the past twenty years borders on absurdity.<br />
The reason that this urban legend is so popular is because it's something that both aficionados and prohibitionists of marijuana like to cite. Prohibitionists want to scare everyone into thinking that using marijuana today can/will lead to psychological problems that history is yet to encounter. Meanwhile, aficionados are so sucked up into the marijuana subculture that they like to think they are getting their hands on the best stuff around.<br />
Maybe if someone encounters a strain called, "Monsanto Mary-Jane," then I will consider revoking everything I just wrote.</p>

      <div class="field field-name-comment-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden" ><p>well the technology has advanced a lot since the 70's but it all depends on the way it is grown and certain strains are known to have higher levels of certain cannabinoids  ..... I personally prefer higher cbd levels because they help with my muscle disorders...... but i always enjoy a nice high thc content ....... but the way that they test the different levels and cannabinoid ratios is with gas chromatography</p>
<p>Cannabinoids have been tested in the past using different methods (HPLC, TLC, GC) and the aim has always been to identify quantities of different cannabinoids inside the cannabis resin. Gas chromatography (GC) is a type of chromatography in which the mobile phase is a carrier gas, usually an inert gas such as helium or an unreactive gas such as nitrogen, and the stationary phase is a microscopic layer of liquid or polymer on an inert solid support, inside a glass column. With gas chromatography the solutions travel through the column in a gas state. The interactions of these gases reacts with the walls of the column (coated by different stationary phases) and causes different compounds to isolate. The main active components in cannabis resin (THC, CBD and CBN) have been analyzed through the years, but now other cannabinoids are proving very interesting for medicinal users. So we decided to extend the testing to include the CBG, a cannabinoid used in many medicinal tests all over the globe. Cannabigerol, also known as CBG, is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in many strains at various concentrations. CBG is mostly useful to lower blood pressure and to alleviate glaucoma, but it is too early to rule out other beneficial effects.<br />

<p>but its all in the way you grow it..... yes certain strains might be more likely to be higher in CBD such as indica strains ..... its all in the say you grow and the time of harvest ..... a microscope and a good eye that knows the right time to pull can succeed in getting a high cbd strain .... oh and the drying and curing process has a lot to due with it..... the amount of light it gets the longer its cured all depends on the cannabinoid ratios/ levels</p>

My brother was a daily weed smoker until he dropped out of high school, lost his car, his home, job and his relationships. My Mom was sure he was headed to jail until he met a woman that was important enough for him to quit. After quiting he got his GED, great job and then started his own company and he's an all around great person. His personality has changed so much since he quit. My niece smoked weed through high school and then went onto meth. She spent a Christmas in rehab away from her 4 year old son. She too lost her job, was in financial ruin and almost lost her son before she stopped and she would tell you going back to weed would be the beginning of a relasp. I worked with a girl that went to lunch and got high everyday. She of course was fired...her work, time missed at work and attitude showed her weed abuse. I saw her bartending after she was fired, what a waste. I work at a manufacturing company and we had a girl lose 2 fingers in a machine...the company always makes you take a drug test after an accident and she tested positive for weed of course she was fired. Another niece was married with 2 children and her husband got into weed...they are now divorced, he lost his business, rarely see's his kids, lives at his Dad's and spent Thanksgiving in jail. We just had an local situation that a few high school girls were getting high in a her car in a parking lot, when a police office approched the car she paniced and tried to drive off...she hit the police officer and then a high speed chase. This 17 year old is being tried as an adult. Almost all good companies require you to pass a drug test for employment. My bosses daughter wasn't able to get a job at her college coffee shop or the local HyVee so she's now working at Taco Bell. She was in a car accident and they found weed in the car, after testing positive she was given a DYI and possesion charge. Her life at only 20 is a mess because she can't stop smoking weed. This drug affects so many people in a negative way and for anyone to make young people rationalize a life destructive drug is irresponsible. Young people need to know how it will affect their lives in a negative way not hear how there is nothing wrong with it. People can deal with life without numbing their mind with drugs...in fact life is pretty amazing when you're clear and not dealing with the consquences drugs will bring. Please stop saying nothing is wrong with smoking weed...this drugs brings grave consequences to so many people.</p>

I could also make an argument against video games because there are ppl who are addicted to video games. So Addicted they lose their jobs and family. Does that mean video games should be illegal? You apparently surround yourself with losers if all these ppl ruined their lives from smoking weed. My brother is a very successful entrepreneur and smokes weed. My mother is a corporate lawyer and smokes weed. Most of my friends have great jobs, great homes, great families.... and they smoke weed. </p>
<p>Also some of your stories help to prove why marijuana should be legal. The girl who panicked when the cop came wouldn't have panicked if weed were legal. Companies couldn't deny employment to people who smoke weed... and they won't have to work at Taco Bell.</p>

<p>I'm very sorry for the bad life experiences your loved ones had to go through, but they are the only ones to blame. Yes, they were pot smokers, however, that wasn't caused their downfalls. It was their own individual personalities and genes that caused your brother to lack the motivation to finish high school or your sister to lack the self control to say no to meth. As for their criminal struggles, those are only existent because of people like you: people who blindly stigmatize marijuana on the basis of popular culture.

I have never seen or experienced any of the things that you talk about. I am a bit livid over your biased and judgmental accusations. You are obviously misdiagnosing your patients and incorrectly demonizing and associating marijuana as the root cause when they obviously have other more serious psychological and medical issues. Everything you use to substantiate your argument is hearsay and biased conjecture. If I were to believe everything that many of my patients said then pigs would be flying and the moon would be made of cheese.</p>

      <div class="field field-name-comment-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden" ><p>Those 3rd party observations don't make it fact either. Please show me proof that Marijuana was the root cause of the problem for these patients.  Just because they are smoking weed when they have major life issues doesn't mean that the weed is the problem. Thats like saying a bank robber robbed the bank because they drove a car to get there and that cars cause people to rob banks not people... </p>
<p>People may turn to weed when they have problems as a way to cope and ease their pain but it doesn't mean that marijuana is what caused the problem. People have issues that they need to work out and cover them up doesn't make them better. I don't think think there is any problem with marijuana use as long as you don't use it to cover up the real problems you're having. Don't blame a plant, it didn't do it, you did.</p>

Is it possible that the problems were because pot is illegal? Not getting a job for fear of failing a drug test or running from the police because you have pot is not a symptom of pot itself but because we have managed to vilify it and make it illegal. I think you are sitting on your high horse backwards.</p>
