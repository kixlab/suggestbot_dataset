		<h1>The Human Baby</h1>
		<div class="byline">
			by James Kimmel, Ph.D.</div>
		<p align="center">&nbsp;<br>&quot;Tenderness appeared in man's mammalian ancestors eons before he learned to preserve fire or shape a stone.&quot;</p>
		<p align="center">- Lewis Mumford, The Conduct of Life<br>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The human infant is a helpless creature at birth. He
          is virtually immobile, he cannot creep, walk, or speak, and is greatly
          limited in his ability to act with purpose. Unlike other primates, he
          cannot even hold on to or cling to his mother. He must be carried if
          he is to go from one place to another. Seventy-five per cent of his
          brain develops after birth. He cannot continue to live without the
          efforts of another human. He requires years of development before he
          can care for himself. A baby's helplessness and immature development
          requires a source of care. Nature has provided a source to match this
          need - the human mother.</p>
		<p>Mothers are biologically and genetically designed to
          nurture their babies. A newborn's mother has everything a baby needs - arms to hold him, breasts with human milk to feed and comfort him,
          a human body to share with him, a person to protect and be there for
          him. She is someone who has evolved with the power and specific
          resources that will allow her baby to continue to live and to develop
          normally after he is born. Mother and infant did not evolve
          separately, but together. The mother is the other half of the human
          nurturing process, a process which begins at conception and which
          continues for many years after birth. Although a mother and her baby
          are from the moment of conception structurally separate, they evolved
          to function together as a unit. Donald Winnicott, the English
          psychologist, has said that, &quot;There is no such thing as a baby,
          there is a baby and someone.&quot; This statement captures the reality
          of the human baby - a reality which is often overlooked in our
          society because babies are inaccurately perceived from the moment of
          birth as separate individuals.</p>
		<p>It is not possible to fully understand the human
          baby or his development if we study him in separateness from the
          &quot;someone&quot; who keeps him alive. There has never been a baby
          who lived without the help and support of another human - with the
          possible exception of a few isolated and unproven reports of feral
          children raised by animals. And since those few individuals were
          abnormal in their development when they were found, it seems safe to
          conclude that a baby who develops without the care of another human
          being will be abnormal. So, when we talk about babies, or about their
          needs, we must also talk about mothers - or the &quot;someone&quot; or
          &quot;someones&quot; who take her place. Babies' needs and who babies
          become, have to do, not only with their genes, but with their
          caretakers and the society in which they develop.</p>
		<p>Babies enter the world with only one power - the
          power to elicit the emotion of tenderness and a caring response to
          them from other humans, especially and specifically from their
          mothers. Everything about an infant is designed to bring about such a
          response. She is small, soft, vulnerable, harmless and engaging. Her
          need for care and protection is obvious. Her cry evolved to make her
          mother (and other humans) anxious and concerned. It is a signal of
          distress to which emotionally appropriate human beings respond to with
          efforts to be of help. Mother and baby are at first strangers to each
          other, but the mother, by affirming her baby's life with herself,
          establishes a joined entity in which each becomes a part of the other.
          The mother becomes the &quot;someone&quot; who makes it possible for
          the baby to continue to live and develop after birth.</p>
		<p>A baby will, shortly after birth, begin to smile, to
          make pleasant and sweet happy sounds, to recognize and to explore his
          mother, and then to laugh, reach out, touch and hug, all of which
          increases his mother's tender attachment to him. He indicates that he
          likes being with his mother, that he wants to be with her, that he is
          not a stranger, that he is a friendly, social being, that he has all
          the human emotions that she does<i>. Mother and baby are structurally
          separate and without a placental attachment after birth, but they are
          not physically or emotionally separate.</i> They evolved to be a
          nursing couple in close, physical contact day and night - a couple
          who are reactive to each other's moods and feelings. A mother smiles
          when her baby smiles, laughs when her baby laughs, is anxious when her
          baby is anxious, content when he is content, peaceful when he is
          peaceful, and sad when he is unhappy. A baby smiles when his mother
          smiles, laughs at her sounds of delight, becomes upset when his mother
          is upset, anxious, distant, angry, or not available when he wants to
          be with her.</p>
		<p>The mother-infant relationship, because of its
          physical intimacy, minimal separateness, strong mutual dependency, and
          the necessity for unity in functioning, collaboration, empathy, and
          identification may well be the most social of all human relationships.
          No other relationship, including that of the adult couple, tests the
          power of the human capacity to imagine, wonder, and become
          &quot;another&quot;, since it is at first nonverbal, and then
          minimally verbal for many years. A baby cannot tell you with language
          who he is, what he feels, or what he wants or needs. The mother must
          come in touch with the &quot;forgotten language&quot;, those
          non-verbal ways of communicating with another of our kind, that once
          was for humans (before we developed language) the only way to express
          our caring feelings to another.</p>
		<p>For a baby, innately social, the relationship with
          his mother is his introduction to humanity, his first human
          relationship, and the one that sets the tone for all of his future
          relationships. For the mother, it is an opportunity to nurture and
          cherish the life of another, to directly share and participate in the
          development and creation of a human being, and by so doing, grow in
          her human connection.</p>
		<p>A baby isn't at first aware that he can have an
          effect on his mother, that he has the power to make her feel
          tenderness toward him. Neither can he do anything special to make her
          take care of him. He is, without knowing it, relying on millions of
          years of mammalian evolution, on the fact that he is a baby and that
          she is a mother, in order to receive the tenderness and nurturing that
          his mother evolved to provide to her children.</p>
		<p>We are a species whose existence is genetically
          rooted in our ability to feel tenderness toward the life we create and
          the capacity to nurture this life, both before and after birth. Prior
          to birth, the nurturing process follows its own natural genetic and
          biological course, and, in its tenacity, can only be terminated by
          miscarriage or abortion. The mother's body spontaneously accommodates
          as well as conditions permit to the growing embryo and fetus. Even
          unwanted conceptions that are carried to full term can deliver healthy
          infants. For many individuals, the process prior to birth, because it
          is independent of culture, may be the only time in their lives when
          they are nurtured in a normal human way.</p>
		<p>As with all mammals, human gestation does not end
          with birth. The nurturing process after birth, although it is
          genetically and biologically continuous with the process before birth,
          is unfortunately not automatic. In humans, the mother can choose, and
          be influenced by others within her culture, to discontinue being a
          part of this process. It is likely that in our human beginnings
          mothers were governed much more by hormonal, instinctive, and
          reflexive processes in their response to their newborns than they
          later came to be. But as we developed our modern brain, the care of
          infants and young children became a conscious activity, and as
          consciousness became more and more determined by culture, the care of
          infants and children became a cultural process, greatly influenced by
          the socioeconomic organization of a society.</p>
		<p>Babies are no longer cared for in ways that fit
          them, but in ways that make them fit their society. We are a species
          that is genetically designed to nurture our offspring and also one
          which can, because of our capacity for consciousness and awareness,
          understand, value, and give priority to the newborn's need for
          nurturing. We can - as individuals and as a society - encourage
          mothers to nurture their babies. However, consciousness is a two-edged
          sword. From cultural conditioning, we can believe, for example, that
          biological mothering is unimportant, unnecessary, and an unfair and
          burdensome intrusion on women's lives, or that too much nurturing
          &quot;spoils&quot; babies and is harmful to their development, or even
          that some babies, depending on their gender, &quot;imperfection&quot;
          at birth, parentage, or &quot;illegitimacy,&quot; should not live.</p>
		<p>We can be certain that for the bulk of human
          existence, mothers, mothering, and a baby's need for a mother were
          highly valued and given great priority by the human group. If such had
          not been the case, we would not have survived as, or continued to be,
          a species that required mothering. Mother and baby could not have
          lived very long on their own, separate from the group. Neither could
          they have survived without the support of the group.</p>
		<p>Ninety-nine percent of all humans who have ever
          lived were hunter-gatherers (Nanda). Studies of hunter-gatherer
          societies readily confirm the respect given, and the support provided,
          by the group to a mother nurturing a baby. Since ancient times,
          however, continuing until the present, there has been a concerted
          effort in Western civilization to eliminate the necessity for the
          natural mother to nurture her newborn. Mothers in many cultures and at
          various times have been encouraged to suppress their tender feelings
          toward their babies, discouraged from nurturing them in the biological
          human way, and to give over their baby's care to others. The wet nurse
          and baby bottle attest to these historical facts. Both of these
          cultural methods of providing infants with sustenance have - to our
          misfortune - succeeded in achieving their goal of eliminating the
          necessity for the natural mother to have to care for her baby. They
          have dramatically changed the biological conditions for human
          reproduction, the way new human life develops and, perhaps, the human
          species itself.</p>
		<p>The history of childhood in the civilized world
          reveals that babies have not always been perceived as lovable or
          needing tenderness. At various times and for varied reasons, they have
          been seen as evil, harmful, burdensome, worthless, unwanted, and
          expendable. They have, of course, been treated in accordance with
          these beliefs about them (deMause, Beekman). Lloyd de Mause, in his
          book on the history of child care, has stated, &quot;The history of
          childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to
          awaken. The further back in history one goes, the lower the level of
          child care, and the more likely children are to be killed, abandoned,
          beaten, terrorized, and sexually abused&quot;.</p>
		<p>DeMause is referring to the societies of
          civilization, not to societies of people living outside civilization.
          The story of people who live as hunter-gatherers is quite different as
          regards children than the one described by him. Studies by
          anthropologists of hunter-gatherer groups do not describe infant and
          child care in these groups as a &quot;nightmare.&quot; They usually
          describe the care of the young as &quot;indulgent&quot;. One does
          find, however, that as these groups are exposed to &quot;civilized
          ways&quot;, the care of babies and young children becomes less
          nurturing and more harsh, cruel, and punitive.</p>
		<p>Humans evolved in the natural world and evolved to
          adapt to that world. Crucial to our success as a species when we lived
          in that world was our capacity to collaborate as a unified group. The
          human individual, as compared to other animals, is poorly endowed to
          survive in nature. We have no claws or fangs that can serve as
          weapons, we are slow-moving, and we have no protective armor. Even our
          superior brain, coupled with the manual dexterity that allows us to
          create what we can imagine, would have little survival value if we
          were not able to act collectively. Indeed, the human brain, with its
          capacity for language, empathy, and the ability to imagine and to play
          at being another, evolved as it did to enhance our capacity for
          collaborative and collective behavior. Those traits that allow us to
          survive in the modern world, such as self-sufficiency, independence,
          competitiveness, selfishness, and indifference to the plight or
          misfortune of others would have had little adaptive value when we
          lived in small groups as hunter-gatherers. Our adaptive strength then
          was in our ability for combined and unified functioning, not in our
          individual and separate skills, powers, possessions, or wealth.</p>
		<p>The nurturing mother-infant interaction, rooted in
          the mother's capacity to care about the life she creates, was for most
          of our existence the model for all human relationships and the
          foundation for human society. It allowed the newborn to be born in an
          immature state and to slowly develop his brain and mind in relation to
          loving others. The nurturing process, predicated on the unity of
          mother and baby, developed individuals who would find it natural to
          function in unison with others. We would be a very different kind of
          species - a very unsocial one - if we were born fully developed and
          did not require mothering.</p>
		<p>A human baby born today, to any parents anywhere in
          the world, would have no trouble fitting into a hunter-gatherer
          society. He evolved to do so. On the other hand, any baby born today
          in modern society does not fit <i>our</i> world, nor would any baby
          born in the past fit it either. Babies (and mothers) have not changed
          in their reproductive biological or genetic structure; it is society
          and mothers who have changed in their response to, and in their
          attitude toward, babies. We no longer value and support mothering or
          the babies' critical need to develop in relation to a tender,
          nurturing mother. We have deviated from the nurturing aspect of
          reproductive biology by changing the baby's &quot;someone&quot;.</p>
		<p>In a society where a baby lives and develops without
          his mother's presence and without human tenderness, some babies, if
          not most, become a different kind of human than they were meant to be.
          They must adapt to and fit the substitutes that have replaced natural
          mothering: formula, pacifiers, cribs, playpens, security objects, and
          substitute caregivers. In doing so, they are, as adults, different
          from adults who develop in relation to a nurturing mother.
          Inappropriately and poorly nurtured children grow up without the
          internalization of tenderness. We evolved to pass on to the newborn
          our tender feelings for them.</p>
		<p>Babies need tenderness. They do not grow well
          without it. It is the stuff that makes us human.<br>&nbsp;</p>
