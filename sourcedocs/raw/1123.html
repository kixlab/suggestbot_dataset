		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">University of Pennsylvania researchers performed Internet searches for slightly more than a month in 2016 to identify CBD products that displayed contents on their labels and were for sale online. They bought 84 products from 31 companies, blinded their labels, and had their contents tested.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A full 70 percent of the labels turned out to be incorrect. The products either contained more CBD than their labels specified, or less. Thirty percent of the labels were “accurate” within a range of 10 percent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Of particular concern was that testing detected THC in 18 of the 84 samples, and the amounts of THC in some products were sufficient to cause intoxication or impairment, especially in children.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The publication of this article in JAMA took place just days after the FDA sent warning letters to four major CBD producers asking them to eliminate all medical claims they make for their products. All have been marketing their products with unproven medical claims. They have 15 business days from last week to remove the claims or FDA can seize their merchandise and put them out of business.</span></p>

He founded and ran Solutions, an after-school alcohol and drug treatment program for young people in Atlanta, Georgia. When he retired recently, he merged Solutions with Caron Treatment Center, a nonprofit organization with treatment facilities in several states.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Dr. Margolis wrote an op-ed for the <em>Atlanta Journal Constitution</em> in 2002 calling for careful, reasoned debate about the legalization of marijuana. Today, he writes that that debate still hasn’t happened. He lays out what science says about the impact of marijuana use on young people and asks if we are prepared to allow next generations to be so drug damaged.</span><br />

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose:</span> This study aims to assess potential health care costs and adverse health effects related to cannabis use in an acute care community hospital in Colorado, comparing study findings to those medical diagnoses noted in the literature. Little information is available about specific hospital health care costs, thus this study will add to the knowledge gap and describe charges and collections from visits of these patients in one hospital&#8217;s Emergency Department (ED). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Objective:</span> Review diagnoses of cannabis users visiting a local ED and outline the potential financial and health effects of these patients on the health care system. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Design:</span> An Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved retrospective observational study of patients seen in the ED from 2009 to 2014 with cannabis diagnoses and positive urine drug analyses (UDA) matched with hospital billing records. Randomized patient records were reviewed to determine completeness of documentation and coding related to cannabis use. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Setting:</span> An acute care hospital in one city in Colorado. The city has nearly 100 medical marijuana dispensaries, but has not legalized recreational cannabis use. The city decided to not allow recreational stores in city limits as they were allowed to make that determination as a result of Amendment 64, which allowed municipalities to determine if they wanted recreational marijuana in their town. As of this publication, more than 70% of Colorado&#8217;s municipalities have opted out of recreation marijuana sales. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Participants:</span> Subjects seen through the ED who had both a diagnosis code listing cannabis and a positive UDA for cannabis. Exclusions were subjects with UDA for cannabis but also tested positive for other substances, subjects who had cannabis diagnosis but no UDA result or those who had no UDA but did have a cannabis diagnosis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Conclusion:</span> Subjects seen in the ED had similar diagnoses as those reviewed in the literature, confirming the serious side effects of marijuana use. During the study period, the study hospital incurred a true loss of twenty million dollars in uncollected charges after allowing for contractual obligations. While adverse health effects have been described in the literature, there is little data on the financial impact of marijuana use on the health care system. This study demonstrated an increasing number of patients who are seen in the ED also have used cannabis. These patients are not always able to pay their bills, resulting in a financial loss to the hospital. The authors encourage the collection of hospital financial data for analysis in the states where medicinal (MMJ) and/or recreational marijuana is legal</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">They narrowed a broad literature review to only 18 trials </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">with a total of 925 participants.

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The House of Delegates of the Medical Association of Georgia (MAG) passed a strongly worded resolution opposing the expansion of “medical” marijuana at its annual meeting October 20-21. Passed unanimously, the resolution sends a clear signal to legislators to reject a Georgia House of Representatives resolution introduced in the 2017 session that carries over to next year. That resolution, if passed, would enable legislators to place a constitutional amendment on the state’s November 2018 ballot to cultivate, process, and sell marijuana for medical use throughout the state.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The issue has evolved in each legislative session since 2014. Current law allows people with 14 different conditions to apply to the Georgia Department of Public Health for a card that provides legal immunity for possessing 20 fluid ounces of “medicinal cannabis” that can contain 5 percent THC.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The MAG House of Delegates’ resolution notes that “calling marijuana ‘medical cannabis’ or ‘low THC oil’ does not alter its psychoactive, neurotoxic, and addictive effects. Marijuana at THC levels of 3 percent, 4 percent, or 5 percent has resulted in hundreds of thousands of Americans experiencing cannabis use dependence since the 1980s.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It points out that “THC has been contraindicated for use in treatment of conditions of children in studies by Children’s Hospital Colorado, Boston Children’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School and Duke University.” It adds that marijuana-related fatal road crashes have increased in Colorado and Washington since those two states fully legalized the drug.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The resolution begins by stating, “Legislators or voters should not decide what medical conditions should be treated by a non-standardized, un-tested drug, namely artisanal THC Oil and related marijuana products, and then base treatment on non-scientific anecdotal information.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">For these and other reasons, the resolution:</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“RESOLVED, that the Medical Association of Georgia oppose the expansion of the legalization of non-standard and non-FDA approved use of cannabis for medical use in Georgia and educate physicians and other clinicians on the risks of artisanal cannabis products lacking FDA approval.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">And “RESOLVED, that the Georgia Delegation submit a resolution to the American Medical Association to work with the National Institutes of Health to ease some of the barriers to medical research regarding chemical components of marijuana such as cannabidiol that show great promise.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The House of Delegates is MAG’s primary legislative and policy-making body, according to its website. It consists of county and specialty medical societies. Dr. Craig Kerins of the Richmond County Medical society introduced the resolution, which was written by Susan Blank, MD, president of the Georgia Society of Addiction Medicine and Gregg Raduka, PhD, executive director of Let’s Be Clear Georgia.</span><br />

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">U.S. marijuana growers’ and processors’ greatest fear has just been realized. One of the largest international producers and marketers of beer, wine, and spirits, Constellation Brands, has bought a 9.9 percent stake in a Canadian marijuana grower, Canopy Growth Corporation. The two companies plan to develop a line of marijuana-infused drinks to sell in Canada, expected to legalize the drug for recreational use in 2018</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">US marijuana growers and processors have long feared that mega corporations like those that make up the alcohol and tobacco industries would swoop in and put them out of business if pot is legalized nationwide. They just didn’t think it would happen in Canada first.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Business analysts say this is a smart move on the part of Constellation Brands, given now-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s campaign promise to legalize the drug if elected.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Whether parents, public health officials, scientists, and doctors agree is another matter. Marijuana beverages being marketed by an alcoholic beverages company with Constellation Brand’s clout is hardly likely to reduce auto traffic injuries and deaths.</span><br />

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">MOUNT SHASTA, Siskiyou County (KPIX 5) — It’s happening in the shadow of Mount Shasta — hundreds of marijuana gardens pockmarking the landscape in neighborhoods that have little in the way of housing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">For law enforcement officials in Siskiyou County, it’s a state of emergency.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“This is a monumental effort but, then again, we’ve got a monumental problem,” says Sheriff Jon E. Lopey.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">What’s unfolding in this county is a race between growers and the law to see who can get to the countless grow gardens first.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“We’re in harvest season. We’re really putting a lot of resources into it and a lot of personnel, trying to take out as much as we can before it gets harvested and goes off back east or wherever it’s going,” said Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Deputy Mike Gilley.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">You can see the enormous extent of the grow gardens from space. Fire up Google Earth and you can count grow after grow dotting the high desert landscape like an outbreak of measles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“I have a one-mile-square photograph and you can pick out 80 gardens in that one square mile,” said Sgt. Gilley.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">All of this is happening in a county that is decidedly not part of the “Emerald Triangle.” In fact, elected officials and voters have passed laws aimed at keeping marijuana out of Siskiyou County.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“Our county does not allow outdoor cultivation of cannabis,” asserts Sheriff Lopey.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Siskiyou County has some of the cheapest — as well as most scenic — land you can find in California. You can purchase nearly three acres for about $16,000. That brings in people who see an opportunity. The sheriff thinks those people represent a nationwide problem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“I think … that this is an organized-crime effort. (They) basically take over large geographic areas to grow illegal marijuana. That’s basically what it amounts to,” Lopey said.</span></p>

		<p>With no age restrictions on its use, some people  – even children – are likely consuming CBD on a very frequent basis.</p>
<p>While a growing chorus of voices recommend CBD oil for all manner of ailments with glowing reviews and assurances of its safety, consumers would be wise to think very carefully before jumping on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>This article seeks to pull back the curtain on the CBD story and reveal the very real potential dangers of use by otherwise healthy people so that you can make a truly informed decision for your family.</p>
<p>Please note that I am not disputing the benefits of cannabis in this article. I know it helps a lot of very sick people manage their illness in a comfortable way without the need for pharmaceuticals. What I am presenting is the other side of the story that is usually not discussed – even glossed over in favor of aggressive marketing to otherwise healthy people.</p>
<p><strong>What is CBD Oil?</strong></p>
<p>CBD oil is an alternative remedy for inflammation, pain, seizures and many other conditions. It is gaining widespread popularity over pharmaceutical drugs to treat the same ailments.</p>
<p>Manufacturers make CBD oil by diluting the active ingredient cannabidiol with a carrier fat such as coconut oil. Depending on what carrier oil is used (i.e., saturated fats or vegetable oils), the remedy then appeals to a wider variety of people. In other words, CBD fans can find an oil that fits their particular food philosophy on fats.</p>
<p><strong>Cannabidiol</strong></p>
<p>You might be surprised to learn that cannabidiol is one of over a hundred compounds known as cannabinoids. The buds, flowers, leaves and stalks (not seeds) of the hemp plant contain them. Other common names for this plant are marijuana or cannabis.</p>
<p>Tetrahydrocannabinol, better known as THC, is another well known cannabinoid in hemp plant matter. It is best known for its mind altering effects, which pot smokers experience firsthand. (1)</p>
<p>Fans of CBD oil claim that cannabidiol is safe because it has zero inherent psychoactive properties like THC. However, this is disputable, if not downright false,  in light of research on both animals and humans. More on this later.</p>
<p><strong>Hash (Cannabis) Oil vs CBD Oil vs Hemp Seed Oil</strong></p>
<p>It is important to understand the key differences between the three primary oils derived from the hemp or marijuana plant. These characteristics determine whether the oil is used as food or medicine and, in turn, whether it is even legal or not.</p>
<p>CBD oil falls in the gray area, which is why it is so confusing and potentially dangerous for anyone except those who are gravely ill with few other treatment options. Hopefully, the discussion below will help clear things up for you!</p>
<p><strong>Cannabidiol (CBD) Oil</strong></p>
<p>As described above, manufacturers create medicinal CBD oil by blending cannabidiol with a carrier oil. This active ingredient is either isolated or alcohol extracted from whole cannabis plant matter.</p>
<p>CBD was legalized in all 50 states by the 2014 Farm Bill, which served as the springboard for its explosive growth. However, this approval came with an important caveat. The legislation required extraction of CBD for academic research or under a state pilot program. Since then, a number of states broadened this narrow definition, which legalized other CBD manufacturing processes. (2)</p>
<p><strong>Hemp Seed Oil</strong></p>
<p>CBD oil is vastly different from hemp seed oil, which is a food and not medicine. It is made by cold pressing the seeds on the cannabis plant. The resulting oil is high in inflammatory omega-6 fats. Hemp seeds contain no THC and hence the oil should technically not contain any either.</p>
<p>Some countries require testing for THC in hemp seed oil to verify purity. Typical requirements are that there are no more than 5-10 or even zero parts per million (ppm) detected in the final product.</p>
<p><strong>Hemp Oil (Hash or Cannabis Oil)</strong></p>
<p>In comparison, hash or cannabis oil does contain high inducing THC. It is also misleadingly known as honey oil.</p>
<p>It comes from aerial parts of the marijuana plant except the seeds. This medicinal or recreational oil can be made from any of the three sub-species of the cannabis plant – Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and more rarely Cannabis ruderalis.</p>
<p>Hash oil is illegal for recreational use in most states but is approved for medicinal use by a growing list of others. It is usually consumed by eating or smoking. It is also sold in cartridges for use in vaping pens.</p>
<p>In summary, while hemp seed oil is widely recognized as safe and available on healthfood store shelves all across the country, hemp oil is still regulated as as a medicinal only drug in some states and completely outlawed in others. CBD oil falls in the gray area somewhere between the two.</p>
<p>The question that remains to be answered is its safety. Does the narrow legalization of CBD in the 2014 Farm Bill guarantee its safety? Or is it actually more risky than consumers have been led to believe?</p>
<p><strong>CBD Oil Risks</strong></p>
<p>The side effects of consuming cannabidiol are very real though commonly glossed over by those selling it.</p>
<p>Drug Contraindications</p>
<p>CBD oil may potentially interact in a negative way with anti-epilepsy drugs. As of now, only in vitro (test tube) observations exist with no living organism testing proving safety. Drugs that may interact include: (3)<br />
•carbamazepine (Tegretol)<br />
•phenytoin (Dilantin)<br />
•phenobarbital (Luminal, Solfoton, Tedral)<br />
•primidone (anti-seizure)</p>
<p><strong>Side Effects</strong></p>
<p>According to a review of existing research by the journal Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research, the most common side effects of consuming CBD or CBD oil include:<br />
•fatigue<br />
•nausea or vomiting<br />
•diarrhea<br />
•dizziness<br />
•anxiety or depression<br />
•changes in appetite/weight<br />
•Psychosis</p>
<p>While there is a well known link between psychotic disorders and pot, CBD is generally regarded as anti-psychotic. (4)</p>
<p>How can this be if a CBD side effect is psychosis? (5)</p>
<p>Perhaps this common belief is simply not true!</p>
<p><strong>Psychoactive Effects of Cannabinoids</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps cannabinoid oil purveyors tend to ignore the well established reactions because the side effect profile of CBD is better than pharmaceutical drugs used to treat similar conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, proponents of CBD oil use insist on its safety because cannabidiol is not mind altering like its cousin cannabinoid THC.</p>
<p>Research from the 1970s seems to confirm that CBD is well tolerated up to 600 mg without psychotic episodes. (6)</p>
<p>However, more recent research disputes this assumption.</p>
<p><strong>Conversion of CBD to THC</strong></p>
<p>Researcher Kazuhito Watanabe, PhD and his team at Daiichi College of Pharmaceuticals, Japan discovered a disturbing problem with cannabidiol. (7)</p>
<p>They found that CBD converts into THC, the same psychosis inducing substance found in weed. In addition, CBD converted into two other THC-like cannabinoids known as HHCs (hexahydroxycannabinols). All three produced high inducing symptoms in mice.</p>
<p>This research indicates that THC is not the only mind altering cannabinoid in hemp. It also suggests the possibility that a person can be exposed to brain altering, high inducing substances by simply consuming CBD.</p>
<p>Getting High on CBD?</p>
<p>Acidity is necessary for the conversion of CBD to THC and the two psychoactive HHCs. Researchers performed this conversion using artificial digestive juices. The change accelerated in the presence of some kind of sugar (or alcohol).</p>
<p>In people consuming CBD oil, this would parallel as acidity in the stomach. Since people commonly consume CBD oil in sugary lattes, candy, goodies, smoothies or alcoholic beverages, this situation mimics the reality of many people who use it.</p>
<p><strong>Effects of THC Derived from CBD</strong></p>
<p>To test the effects of these components, the researchers then injected mice with small quantities of the THC and HHCs converted from CBD. The researchers tested for the four most common symptoms of THC exposure including:<br />
•Catalepsy – loss of sensation or consciousness<br />
•Hypothermia – drop in body temperature<br />
•Prolonged sleep<br />
•Reduced pain perception</p>
<p>Mice injected with small amounts of THC and HHCs converted in artificial gastric juices from CBD tested positively for all 4 pot exposure symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Human Studies</strong></p>
<p>Follow-up research in 2016 published in the journal Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research gives additional pause.</p>
<p>More than 40% of epileptic children orally administered CBD exhibited adverse events, with THC like symptoms the most common. In their conclusion, researchers challenged the accepted premise that CBD is not high-inducing.</p>
<p>Gastric fluid without enzymes converts CBD into the psychoactive components Δ9-THC and Δ8-THC, which suggests that the oral route of administration may increase the potential for psychomimetic adverse effects from CBD. (8)</p>
<p><strong>Is CBD Oil Safe for Children?<br />
</strong><br />
The takeaway of existing research as of this writing seems to indicate extreme caution when it comes to ingestion of CBD oil especially by children.</p>
<p>Research definitively shows that THC exposure affects their developing brains in a negative way – perhaps permanently. The important point here is that consuming CBD or CBD infused oil can initiate this THC exposure – not just smoking or vaping pot. The Journal of Current Pharmaceutical Design warns:</p>
<p>The literature not only suggests neurocognitive disadvantages to using marijuana in the domains of attention and memory that persist beyond abstinence, but suggest possible macrostructural brain alterations (e.g., morphometry changes in gray matter tissue), changes in white matter tract integrity (e.g., poorer coherence in white matter fibers), and abnormalities of neural functioning (e.g., increased brain activation, changes in neurovascular functioning). (9)</p>
<p><strong>CBD During Pregnancy<br />
</strong><br />
The Journal Future Neurology warns that cannabis exposure crosses the placenta. “Human epidemiological and animal studies have found that prenatal cannabis exposure influences brain development and can have long-lasting impacts on cognitive functions.” (10)</p>
<p>Since CBD partially converts to THC under acidic conditions, women who consume CBD oil for morning sickness or other discomforts of pregnancy should understand that use may mimic using pot directly. Just because CBD oil is natural and works effectively to alleviate symptoms does not mean it is safe for your baby.</p>
<p>Always discuss any supplemental foods with a practitioner before use!</p>
<p><strong>CBD from Hops and Other Non-Cannabis Plants</strong></p>
<p>Some CBD products and oil come from plants other than cannabis. Hops is one that is popular currently. (11)</p>
<p>People that use non-cannabis CBD mistakenly believe that they are safe from THC. False marketing of these products encourages this line of thinking.</p>
<p>Be warned that no matter where CBD comes from, the potential for conversion of CBD to THC in the digestive tract exists. CBD is ultimately a cannabinoid no matter what plant it comes from. Thus, unless the CBD is applied transdermally or intravenously to avoid the acidic conditions within the digestive tract, the risk for THC exposure and brain-altering effects still exists.</p>
<p>To give you a example of how this works, consider how beta carotene converts to Vitamin A in the digestive tract. It doesn’t matter if the beta carotene comes from carrots, peppers or squash. This nutrient will still potentially convert to Vitamin A. The same principle applies to CBD that is consumed orally. The digestive process can result in conversion to THC no matter what plant is the source of the CBD.</p>
<p><strong>Is CBD Safe for Anyone?<br />
</strong><br />
Consumers desperately need more research about the high-inducing effects of CBD-to-THC that could manifest as a result of the digestive process.</p>
<p>The half life of oral CBD in the body is about 2 days. Thus, depending on how much a person consumes and how often, the potential risk of psychosis could increase over time depending on individual metabolism.</p>
<p>It seems that, as of this writing, the prudent course of action for the cautious consumer is to adopt a wait and see attitude toward CBD and CBD oil products pending further research on the very real potential for mind altering, pot-like effects.</p>
<p>Some companies are already working to develop synthetic transdermal CBD. Such a drug would bypass the gastrointestinal tract and avoid bioconversion to psychoactive THC and/or HHCs. Of course, this treatment likely has its own set of yet unknown dangers!</p>
<p>While the risks of THC exposure from CBD oil and other products are likely of little concern for gravely ill people who desperately need it, for otherwise healthy people and children, beware! It seems wise until further research is concluded to treat CBD oil, candy, and other products just like any other high inducing drug. Just. Say. No.</p>

<p>Well, by now Healthline has corrected the article you reference as evidence for CBD causing psychosis, after I (and maybe others, who knows) pointed out to them that they had mistakenly put the side effects of THC for those of CBD. Now it lists only diarrhoea, changes in appetite and fatigue. Time for you to follow suit? You both reference the same scientific article, and now that this is the only remaining reference to back up your claim, I think it is time you actually looked at it and realised that it does not support your claim either. Could you then still go on and claim to have truth on your side, knowing that your claim is based on nothing at all? And keep on calling people who disagree with you biased? It’s pretty clear to me who is the biased one here, and probably to most others as well.<br />
 Sarah, you may have good intentions but you are not making the world a better place by publishing misinformation. Maybe a few people will be kept from trying CBD due to reading it, but most people will realise right away how ridiculous it is. It will just contribute to their mistrust of official information and authority figures on the subject of drugs. Because fact is that a lot of fairly harmless drugs have been needlessly demonised along with the genuinely dangerous ones since Nixon started his war on drugs. You might believe otherwise, but people who try them know better. And the more misinformation they see around them, the more they will be inclined to disbelieve also the genuine warnings about those drugs which can actually be really harmful. Especially now in this age of ‘fake news’ where people are more and more unsure of what information they can trust. People actually end up harming themselves much more due to ignorance than they would if they had full knowledge of the whole subject in advance! Proper education is the way to reduce the harm from drugs the most, not waging a war against them with misinformation – isn’t it obvious by now that this war has totally failed, because it is unwinnable?</p>

<p>I actually cited a scientific study about CBD converting to THC in the gut! You are welcome to believe anything you like, but the fact is that some people do experience psychosis from CBD. Read through the comments and read the referenced research study.</p>

<p>rooislangwtf</p>
<p>The effort the Japanese study went to, to convert cbd to thc makes me wonder what the likelihood is of it actually happening in the human body (ph of 1.2 that’s lower than normal gastric acid and then a heck of a lot of purification). The epilepsy study didn’t go past observation to indicate thc effects (urine tests would’ve helped).</p>
<p>So the real conclusion to draw is until more tests are done:<br />
 Dont take cbd with alcohol or a lot of sugars or get a way to take cbd non orally (a patch or a suppository maybe).</p>

<p>I believe you picked and chose your so-called info from a multitude of sources without validating ANY of it. You are doing an extreme dis-service to those who use CBD effectively. People have to do their own research and find what works for them. Not all brands are created equal. I could write a book, with VALID sources, disputing virtually every point you made.</p>

<p>I find it amusing that people who disagree with an article frequently get in a huff and claim that “all” the sources/references are invalid and that they could “write a book” disputing every point. LOL Go read a site then that confirms all your biases. You don’t want the truth .. you want an article validating your belief system.</p>

<p>I believe failed to include that the types of CBD oils in question are the Full Spectrum which has THC properties. The two other types will NOT produce THC and they are Broad Spectrum and Isolate Spectrum. The majority of CBD oils on the market today are Full Spectrum with THC compounds, however when the THC is extracted from the CBD Oils you have a Broad Spectrum product which may cost more, but will NOT have THC period! Do your homework and don’t always believe everything you read, especially when the Spectrums were never discussed</p>

<p>Please read the article. You have apparently missed the point completely as have several other commenters. There is NO BRAND of CBD oil that is safe. ANY cannabidiol even if from another plant (like hops) will potentially trigger a conversion to THC in the gut. When NYC just banned CBD from edibles sold at restaurants, healthfood stores etc, there was NO distinction between “full spectrum” and isolate spectrum.</p>

<p>Not all CBDs are created equal. Not all CBD has THC. A lot have trace amounts however not all. My company is 100% 0.00000 % THC free.</p>

<p>I don’t think you understood the article! I am not suggesting that any CBD oil has THC in it … it DOESN’T MATTER how your CBD oil is produced … some CAN AND DOES CONVERT to small amounts of THC in the acidity of the digestive tract when consumed. Some people have a HUGE negative reaction to this.</p>
<p>Beta carotene partially converts to Vitamin A in the digestive tract too as do many other substances. </p>

<p>J Clin Psychiatry 2018;79(6):17m11977 </p>
<p>10.4088/JCP.17m11977 </p>
<p>Objective: Associations between adolescent cannabis use and poor neurocognitive functioning have been reported from cross-sectional studies that cannot determine causality. Prospective designs can assess whether extended cannabis abstinence has a beneficial effect on cognition. </p>
<p>Methods: Eighty-eight adolescents and young adults (aged 16–25 years) who used cannabis regularly were recruited from the community and a local high school between July 2015 and December 2016. Participants were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of cannabis abstinence, verified by decreasing 11-nor-9-carboxy-∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol urine concentration (MJ-Abst; n = 62), or a monitoring control condition with no abstinence requirement (MJ-Mon; n = 26). Attention and memory were assessed at baseline and weekly for 4 weeks with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. </p>
<p>Results: Among MJ-Abst participants, 55 (88.7%) met a priori criteria for biochemically confirmed 30-day continuous abstinence. There was an effect of abstinence on verbal memory (P = .002) that was consistent across 4 weeks of abstinence, with no time-by-abstinence interaction, and was driven by improved verbal learning in the first week of abstinence. MJ-Abst participants had better memory overall and at weeks 1, 2, 3 than MJ-Mon participants, and only MJ-Abst participants improved in memory from baseline to week 1. There was no effect of abstinence on attention: both groups improved similarly, consistent with a practice effect. </p>
<p>Conclusions: This study suggests that cannabis abstinence is associated with improvements in verbal learning that appear to occur largely in the first week following last use. Future studies are needed to determine whether the improvement in cognition with abstinence is associated with improvement in academic and other functional outcomes. </p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">When people like the headline writer of this <em>HealthDay</em> news article talk about “medical marijuana,” they usually mean everything. The plant’s dried flowers which people smoke. Concentrates that can contain up to 90 percent THC, whose extraordinarily high levels are almost certainly what is sending toddlers and children who accidentally consume them and adults who consume them on purpose to emergency rooms with many needing to be hospitalized. “Edibles” – cookies, candies, and soft drinks infused with marijuana that are now in the food chain. And hundreds more, all sold as “medicines.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The <em>HealthDay</em> author does a good job of covering a new study in <em>Pediatrics</em>, the journal of the American Association of Pediatrics. But notice the study’s title: “Medical Cannabinoids – not Medical Marijuana – in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">What’s the difference?  </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The marijuana plant contains about 500 different chemicals. Most have not been studied. Some 100 of those are called cannabinoids, so-called because they are unique to the cannabis plant. Most of these have not been studied either, but that is changing. Some cannabinoids show scientific promise and may become medicines. Two already are.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">By medicines, we mean they have gone through rigorous preclinical (test tubes and animals) and clinical (humans) research. They have proven to FDA that they are both safe and effective, can be manufactured with a consistent dose, and most importantly <em>are pure</em>. They contain no contaminants unlike most of the products in legal states. A further FDA safeguard is that sometimes approved medicines cause dangerous side effects in the larger population after approval. FDA has a notification system that requires doctors to report any that occur so the medicine can be pulled from the market, if necessary.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The most studied cannabinoids are delta-9 THC and cannabidiol (CBD). The former makes people high. The latter doesn’t. The two medicines that FDA has approved are nabilone (trade name Cesamet<sup>®</sup>) and dronabinol (trade names Marinol<sup>® </sup>and Syndros<sup>®</sup>). Cesamet<sup>®</sup> and Marinol<sup>®</sup> are pills. Syndros<sup>®</sup> is an oral liquid. They are used to reduce chemotherapy-related nausea and AIDS wasting in patients who do not respond to standard medications.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Two more cannabinoids, nabiximols (trade name Sativex<sup>®</sup>, approved in other countries but not yet in the US yet) and CBD (trade name Epidiolex<sup>®</sup> which has completed clinical trials and is applying for FDA approval) are in the pipeline.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">About half our medicines originated in plants. But when drug makers create a new medicine from them, they use pure chemicals to make a molecule-for-molecule carbon copy of the plant’s component. Nabilone and dronabinol are made that way. Patients know when they take these medicines that they will not contain any contaminants and FDA has approved them.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Not so the “medical” marijuana products being produced and sold in states that have legalized the drug for medical use. In fact, the American Epilepsy Society calls such CBD products “artisanal CBD” to differentiate them all from Epidiolex<sup>®</sup>, which may be available as early as next year to treat children and adolescents suffering intractable seizures.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> </span><br />

<p id="first" class="lead" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A systematic review of published studies on the use of medical cannabis in children and adolescents finds a notable lack of studies and a minimal number of the randomized, controlled trials needed to confirm the effectiveness of a treatment. In their paper published in the journal <em>Pediatrics</em>, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators Shane Shucheng Wong, MD, and Timothy Wilens, MD &#8212; both of the MGH Department of Psychiatry &#8212; report that their review suggests only two pediatric uses of medical cannabis &#8212; to relieve chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and to reduce seizures &#8212; are supported by existing studies.</span></p>
<div id="text">
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;Medical cannabis is now legal in 29 states and the District of Columbia, and in those areas with active programs, children and adolescents can legally access medical cannabis with certification from their doctor and consent from a parent or guardian,&#8221; says lead author Wong. &#8220;This means that doctors and families need to understand what we know and what we don&#8217;t yet know about medical cannabis in order to make the best decision for the health of the individual child.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Two synthetic cannabinoids &#8212; compounds that act on specific receptors in the brain &#8212; have been approved for medical use in the U.S., both of which mimic a form of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the compound responsible for the &#8220;high&#8221; of recreational cannabis use. Dronabinol (Marinol) is approved to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in both children and adults, while the pediatric use of nabilone (Cesamet) carries a caution. A third cannabinoid, cannabidiol, is currently in phase 3 trials for treatment of seizures.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The researchers followed established procedures in searching for studies of medical cannabis use listed in major research indexes and selected out those that primarily enrolled participants aged 18 and under and included original data about a clinical use. Only 21 papers reporting on a total of 22 studies met their criteria. The papers were published from 1979 to 2017, 14 within the last five years. Only 5 were randomized controlled trials, the others being case reports, open-label trials, parent surveys or case series. The most common conditions studied were chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (6 studies) and seizures (11 studies).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The trials for chemotherapy side effects &#8212; 4 of which were randomized controlled trials &#8212; found that medical cannabis was significantly better than anti-nausea drugs standard at the time of study for reducing nausea and vomiting. Similarly the epilepsy studies, including a single randomized trial, found that medical cannabis reduced the frequency of seizures in participants, some with treatment-resistant seizures. Limitations of these studies include lack of a control group for many, small sample size, differences in the medications used and lack of long-term follow-up.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Two studies investigating the use of cannabis for spasticity and three case report on use for neuropathic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder or Tourette syndrome all lacked controls or blinding, conferring a high risk of biased findings. &#8220;At this time,&#8221; Wong says, &#8220;we do not have good evidence that cannabis can be useful in children and adolescents for any conditions other than seizures or chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">He and Wilens also note that decisions regarding medical cannabis use need to weigh the likely benefits against the known risks, which &#8212; based on the results of studies in recreational cannabis users &#8212; are probably even greater for children and adolescents. Their still-developing brains may make them even more vulnerable than adults to cannabis&#8217;s negative effects on learning, memory, attention and problem solving. Additional research is needed to better understand the risks and long-term effects of cannabis-based drugs in this population.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">When asked how he would advise the parents of a child with a condition that could be alleviated with medical cannabis, Wong states, &#8220;I would recommend they have a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits with a physician who has specialized knowledge and experience in the area. For chemotherapy side effects, that could be a pediatric oncologist or palliative care specialist; for seizures, that could be a pediatric neurologist, especially at an academic medical center involved in the ongoing clinical trials of medical cannabis for seizure disorders.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">CALISTOGA, Calif. — Marijuana farmers and dispensary owners across Northern California are nervously watching as wildfires burn through some of the state’s prime cannabis growing areas and destroy valuable crops, which could drive up prices for consumers across the country.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“This is right smack in the middle of people’s harvests,” said Eli Melrod, the CEO of Solful Dispensary in Sebastopol, in northern California. “It couldn’t have been worse timing, frankly.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A single marijuana plant can be worth up to $5,000, but pot growers can’t get crop insurance like traditional farmers or the vintners whose grapevines tend to get most of the attention here.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Wildfires are burning across parts of Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino counties, which are known for both wine and marijuana, particularly among high-end consumers willing to pay a premium for the name.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Complicating matters: Marijuana farms are built in remote areas with poor road access and don’t necessarily appear on firefighters’ maps of buildings to be protected. The growers often live largely off the radar, without health insurance or access to traditional job support systems such as unemployment insurance. Black market growers may be reluctant to tell friends and family members of the losses they’ve suffered.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“It’s just sad that we live in this underground world where we can’t discuss the true extent of the damage,” said Jessica Lilga of Alta Supply, a statewide wholesale cannabis distribution based in Oakland. “All remaining growers who did not literally lose their crops will be affected.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/636433386289791100-11.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15324" src="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/636433386289791100-11-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="300" srcset="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/636433386289791100-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/636433386289791100-11-768x511.jpg 768w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/636433386289791100-11-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/636433386289791100-11.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></span></p>

<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">It’s unclear exactly how many people work in the cannabis industry in northern California and how many cultivation operations exist. Lilga said she’s aware of “thousands” of grow operations but was reluctant to speculate, given the industry’s secretive nature.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But any interruption could have widespread implications for American marijuana consumers, legal or otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Millions of Californians consume medical marijuana, but even more pot is illegally shipped across state lines for black markets around the U.S. California’s legal cannabis market is worth an estimated $2.76 billion, according to marijuana analytics firm New Frontier Data, while the state’s black market is worth $13.5 billion, according to GreenWave Advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">GreenWave estimates that nearly $11 billion worth of the state’s black-market cannabis is grown in Northern California, with a “significant” amount of that shipped to neighboring states. In comparison, the California wine industry is worth an estimated $114 billion nationally, although the two industries are hard to compare side-by-side because one is illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Lilga, who lives in Santa Rosa, was evacuated herself when the wildfire ran over her neighborhood. She’s not sure she has a home to return to: “That cash that all these growers should be bringing in next month would help rebuild our burning cities if it were not all taken away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Lilga predicted that an otherwise good crop year means the state’s overall supply should be enough to meet demand without significantly impacting price. Still, many cannabis dispensaries and distributors are setting up GoFundMe accounts to help growers who have lost their crops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Farmer Kim Tate of One Feather Ranch in Mendocino’s Redwood Valley said wildfires forced her to evacuate with her horses, leaving behind her entire year’s crop that was expected to yield about 350 pounds of cannabis. About two-thirds of the crop had been harvested and stored before the fire broke out, she said, but the rest remained in the fields and growing rooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">As with wine, marijuana contaminated by wildfire smoke may leave behind an unpleasant taste for consumers, Melrod said. Tate said she hoped to use ozone to flush her organically raised plants of any toxins. Every bit will matter: A pound of high-quality marijuana is worth about $1,200 on the wholesale market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“We’re going to see have to see how smoky it is,” she said as she tried to return to the ranch Thursday.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">By Peter Fimrite</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="47"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The legalization of cannabis in California has done almost nothing to halt illegal marijuana growing by Mexican drug cartels, which are laying bare large swaths of national forest in California, poisoning wildlife, and siphoning precious water out of creeks and rivers, U.S. Attorney McGregor Scott said Tuesday.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="47"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The situation is so dire that federal, state and local law enforcement officials are using $2.5 million from the Trump administration this year to crack down on illegal growers, who Scott said have been brazenly setting booby traps, confronting hikers and attacking federal drug-sniffing dogs with knives.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="46"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Instead of fading away after legal marijuana retail sales went into effect this year, the problem has gotten worse, according to Scott, who was joined in a news conference Tuesday in Sacramento by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and other federal forestry and law enforcement officials.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="33"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Most alarming, Scott said, is the increasing use of carbofuran, a federally restricted insecticide so powerful that a teaspoon of it can kill a 600-pound African lion. The insecticide is banned in California.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="23"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The problem of illegal growing operations and contaminated lands “is biblical in proportion,” he said. “The chemicals have gone to a different level.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="29"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The cartels, mainly from Mexico, use 760 tons of fertilizer on 400 grows every year hidden on the 20 million acres of national forest land in California, officials said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="58"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The growers clear-cut trees, remove native vegetation, cause erosion, shoot deer and other animals, and litter the landscape with garbage and human waste. They also divert hundreds of millions of gallons of water from streams and creeks, and the runoff is generally contaminated with pesticides, which are also found in the plants, soil and wildlife in the area.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="71"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This year, 70 percent of the endangered spotted owls tested near sites that had been used for illegal marijuana cultivation were found to have one rodenticide or more in their systems, officials said. One owl died, leaving a clutch of eggs. Last year, 43 poisoned animals were found, including deer, bears, foxes, coyotes, rabbits and rare Pacific fishers. Another 47 animals had been shot, most likely by illegal growers, authorities said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="71"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Since 2012, 17 Pacific fishers have been killed by pesticides at grow sites, said Mourad Gabriel, the director of the Integral Ecology Research Center, a wildlife and environmental research nonprofit. He said carbofuran was found in 78 percent of the plantations eradicated in 2017. That’s compared with 40 percent in 2015 and only 10 to 12 percent in 2012, when he conducted the first scientific study of illegal marijuana grow sites.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="45"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“It’s concerning, because now when we go into these sites we find contamination in the native vegetation, the soil, the water; and it’s increasing,” said Gabriel, whose research is funded by state and federal grants. “Those sites are still contaminated two or three years later.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="19"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In all, 1.4 million illegally grown marijuana plants were destroyed in raids in national forests in California in 2017.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="54"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Bill Ruzzamenti, the former director of the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting, said California supplies 60 to 80 percent of all the marijuana consumed in the nation. In 2016, he said, 11 million pounds left the state, which is illegal under Proposition 64, the initiative that legalized the drug for recreational use in the state.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="20"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The people guarding the grow sites are inevitably armed and “a public safety risk to all of us,” said Becerra.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="29"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Margaret Mims, the sheriff of Fresno County, said hikers, backpackers and nature lovers have reported running across fishhooks hanging at eye level and trip wires possibly attached to shotguns.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="45"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“I have grandkids and I like to go fishing, but there are places we will not go because I am afraid for my grandkids,” said Ruzzamenti, who is now director of the federal High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program. “That should be unacceptable to everybody.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="31"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The problem isn’t new. Bootleg cannabis has been circulating around Mendocino, Humboldt and Trinity counties — the famed Emerald Triangle — for decades, and backwoods growing is ingrained in the culture.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="46"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Ruzzamenti said he has been trying to eradicate black-market growing on public lands since 1983. And Mexican cartels aren’t the only problem. Only a few hundred of the estimated 12,500 retail operators in the state last year have become licensed so far, according to industry officials.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="30"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In Mendocino County alone, as many as 75 percent of residents in some remote areas are marijuana growers, and only about 10 percent of the crop is being grown legally.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="35"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The issue has taken on a new level of importance as the multibillion-dollar California cannabis industry begins to ramp up. Legal growers and retailers want desperately to protect the regulated, taxed marijuana market in California.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="46"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The hope is that taxes collected by the government can fund law enforcement efforts, which will, in turn, deter illegal operations and generate additional taxes. Wholesale prices for marijuana are also expected to drop with the mainstreaming of the industry, providing less incentive for bad actors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="63"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But so far that hasn’t worked. In all, California collected $60.9 million in excise, cultivation and sales taxes related to legal marijuana for the first three months of 2018. Gov. Jerry Brown’s January budget proposal predicted that $175 million would pour in over the first six months from the new taxes. That would have translated to $87.5 million in January, February and March.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="44"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In his updated budget plan released earlier this month, Brown proposed spending $14 million to create four investigative teams and one interdiction team to combat illegal activities, tax evasion and crime. The money would come from tax revenue and licensing fees over two years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="26"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Even though marijuana is still illegal on the federal level, Scott said the U.S. Attorney’s office plans to focus only on illegal growers on public lands.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="18"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Becerra said that without the help of the federal government, California wouldn’t be able to handle the problem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" data-words="10"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“You gotta make it so crime doesn’t pay,” he said.</span></p>

And the state’s teens are more likely to smoke marijuana than young people nationwide.</span></div>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Although we have the same problems with marijuana as we do with liquor abuse, no blockbuster conclusions came from a recent report on Washington’s marijuana universe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But a couple of somewhat unexpected environmental wrinkles from Washington’s marijuana industry — both legal and illegal — also emerge in the second annual <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://wsnia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/NWHIDTA-Marijuana-Impact-Report-Volume-2_August-2017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">look at the state&#8217;s experience</a> since passage of a 2012 initiative allowing recreational pot sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Marijuana growers and processors use 1.63 percent of the state’s electricity, which is a lot, according to the report by the Northwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area — a combined effort by several federal, state and local government agencies. By way of comparison, all forms of lighting — in homes, commercial buildings and manufacturing — <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=electricity_use">account</a> for just 7 to 11 percent of electrical consumption nationally. Or, as the report puts it, the power is enough for 2 million homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The high power consumption stems from the heat lamps and the accompanying air conditioning for indoor marijuana growing operations. “They are exceedingly energy-consumptive,” said Steven Freng, manager for prevention and treatment for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The carbon footprint, according to the report, equals that of about 3 million cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">And illegal pot growers siphoned off 43.2 million gallons of water from streams and aquifers during the 2016 growing season — water that tribes, farmers and cities would otherwise use as carefully as possible, in part to protect salmon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Sixty percent of Washington’s illegal pot was grown on state-owned land in 2016. That’s because black-market growers tend to worry about gun-toting owners on private lands, according to Freng and Luci McKean, the organization&#8217;s deputy director. The black-market operations use the water during a roughly 120-day growing season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Marijuana purchases have boomed in Washington. Legal marijuana sales were almost $1 billion in fiscal year 2016 and were on track to be about $1.5 billion in fiscal 2017, which ended June 30. As of February, the state had 1,121 licensed producers, 1,106 licensed processors and 470 licensed retailers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">What Washington&#8217;s marijuana users are getting is above average in potency. According to the report, nationwide marijuana products average a THC percentage of 13.2 percent, while Washington state’s THC average percentage was 21.6 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Teen use of marijuana has grown slightly. Depending on how the numbers are crunched, marijuana use among Washington’s young adults and teens ranges from 2 to 5 percent above the national average. Five percent of Washingtonians age 18-to-25 use pot daily, slightly above the national average, the report said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">According to a survey cited in the report, 17 percent of high school seniors and 9 percent of high school sophomores have driven within three hours after smoking pot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Adult use before driving is still a fuzzy picture. A third of Washingtonians arrested for driving under the influence had THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, in their bloodstreams. One study found an increase in dead drivers with THC above the legal limit in their blood from 7.8 percent in 2013 to 12.8 percent in 2014.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“Adults still don’t understand the effects of impairment behind the wheel of a car,” Freng said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">McKean said that one major unknown is marijuana-laced edibles, which authorities believe have become a significant factor in THC-impaired drivers, but has not been studied enough to provide solid numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Another major unknown, McKean and Freng said, is how marijuana consumption contributes to emergency room and hospital cases because the state hospitals have not agreed to release that data to government officials.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Christina Brezing, MD, Frances Levin, MD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It is vital that physicians—particularly psychiatrists who are on the frontlines with patients who struggle with cannabis use—are able to identify and characterize cannabis use disorders; provide education; and offer effective, evidence-based treatments. This article provides a brief overview of each of these topics by walking through clinical decision-making with a case vignette that touches on common experiences in treating a patient with cannabis use disorder.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A separate and important issue is screening for emerging drugs of abuse, including synthetic “marijuana” products such as K2 and spice. Although these products are chemically distinct from the psychoactive compounds in the traditional cannabis plant, some cannabis users have tried synthetic “marijuana” products because of their gross physical similarity to cannabis plant matter.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em><strong>CASE VIGNETTE</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>Mr. M is a 43-year-old legal clerk who has been working in the same office for 20 years. He presents as a referral from his primary care physician to your outpatient psychiatry office for an initial evaluation regarding “managing some mid-life issues.” He states that while he likes his job, it is the only job he has had since graduating college and he finds the work boring, noting that most of his co-workers have gone on to law school or more senior positions in the firm. When asked what factors have prevented him from seeking different career opportunities, he states that he would “fail a drug test.” Upon further inquiry, Mr. M says he has been smoking 2 or 3 “joints” or taking a few hits off of his “vaping pen” of cannabis daily for many years, for which he spends approximately $70 to $100 a week.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>He first used cannabis in college and initially only smoked “a couple hits” in social settings. Over time, he has needed more cannabis to “take the edge off” and has strong cravings to use daily. He reports liking how cannabis decreases his anxiety and helps him fall asleep, although he thinks the cannabis sometimes makes him “paranoid,” which results in his avoidance of family and friends.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>More recently, he identifies conflict and regular arguments with his wife over his cannabis use—she feels it prevents him from being present with his family and is a financial burden. He admits missing an important awards ceremony for her work and sporting events for his children, for which he had to “come up with excuses,” but the truth is that he ended up smoking more than he had intended and lost track of the time.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>Mr. M reports multiple previous unsuccessful attempts to reduce his use and 2 days when he stopped completely, which resulted in “terrible dreams,” poor sleep, sweating, no appetite, anxiety, irritability, and strong cravings for cannabis. Resumption of his cannabis use relieved these symptoms. He denies tobacco or other drug use, including use of synthetic marijuana products such as K2 or spice, and reports having a glass of wine or champagne once or twice a year for special occasions.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>The diagnosis</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In the transition from DSM IV-TR to DSM-5, cannabis use disorders, along with all substance use disorders, have been redefined in line with characterizing a spectrum of pathology and impairment. The criteria to qualify for a cannabis use disorder remain the same except for the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>1.</strong> The criterion for recurrent legal problems has been removed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>2.</strong> A new criterion for craving or a strong desire or urge to use cannabis has been added, and the terms abuse and dependence were eliminated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">To qualify as having a cannabis use disorder, a threshold of 2 criteria must be met. Severity of the disorder is characterized as “mild” if 2 or 3 criteria are met, “moderate” if 4 or 5 criteria are met, and “severe” if 6 or more criteria are met. Mr. M demonstrates 3 symptoms of impaired control: using longer than intended, unsuccessful efforts to cut back, and craving; 3 symptoms of social impairment: failure to fulfill home obligations, persistent problems with his wife, and reduced pursuit of occupational opportunities; 1 symptom of risky use: continued use despite paranoia; and 2 symptoms of pharmacological properties: tolerance and withdrawal. As such, he meets 9 criteria, which qualify him for a diagnosis of severe cannabis use disorder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">You summarize Mr. M’s 9 symptoms and counsel him about severe cannabis use disorder. He becomes upset and states that he was not aware one could develop an “addiction” to cannabis. He expresses an interest in treatment and asks what options are available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Treatment options</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Psychotherapeutic treatments, including motivational enhancement treatment (MET), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and contingency management (CM), have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing frequency and quantity of cannabis use, but abstinence rates remain modest and decline after treatment. Generally, MET is effective at engaging individuals who are ambivalent about treatment; CM can lead to longer periods of abstinence during treatment by incentivizing abstinence; and CBT can work to enhance abstinence following treatment (preventing relapse). Longer duration of psychotherapy is associated with better outcomes. However, access to evidence-based psychotherapy is frequently limited, and poor adherence to evidence-based psychotherapy is common.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In conjunction with psychotherapy, medication strategies should be considered. Because there are no FDA-approved pharmacological agents for cannabis use disorder, patients should understand during the informed consent process that all pharmacotherapies used to treat this disorder are off-label. A number of clinical trials provide evidence for the off-label use of medications in the treatment of cannabis use disorder. The current strategies for the off-label treatment of cannabis use disorder target withdrawal symptoms, aim to initiate abstinence and prevent relapse or reduce use depending on the patient’s goals, and treat psychiatric comorbidity and symptoms that may be driving cannabis use. Here we focus on the evidence supporting these key strategies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Targeting withdrawal and craving</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Cannabis withdrawal is defined by DSM-5 as having 3 or more of the following signs and symptoms that develop after the cessation of prolonged cannabis use:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">• Irritability, anger, or aggression</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">• Nervousness or anxiety</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">• Sleep difficulty</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">• Decreased appetite or weight loss</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">• Restlessness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">• Depressed mood</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">• At least one of the following physical symptoms that causes discomfort: abdominal pain, shakiness/tremors, sweating, fever, chills, or headache</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Withdrawal symptoms may be present within the first 24 hours. Overall, they peak within the first week and persist up to 1 month following the last use of cannabis. In the case of Mr. M, insomnia, poor appetite, and irritability as well as sweating are identified, which meet DSM-5 criteria for cannabis withdrawal during the 2 days he abstained from use. He also identifies strong craving and vivid dreams, which are additional withdrawal symptoms included on marijuana withdrawal checklists in research studies, although not included in DSM-5 criteria. These and other symptoms should be considered in clinical treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Medication treatment studies for cannabis withdrawal have hypothesized that if withdrawal symptoms can be reduced or alleviated during cessation from regular cannabis use, people will be less likely to resume cannabis use and will have better treatment outcomes. Studies have shown that dronabinol and nabilone improved multiple withdrawal symptoms, including craving; and quetiapine, zolpidem, and mirtazapine help with withdrawal-induced sleep disturbances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Combining dronabinol and lofexidine (an alpha-2 agonist) was superior to placebo in reducing craving, withdrawal, and self-administration during abstinence in a laboratory model. However, in a subsequent treatment trial, the combined medication treatment was not superior to placebo in reducing cannabis use or promoting abstinence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Six double-blind placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy trials in adults with cannabis use disorder have looked at withdrawal as an outcome. Of these studies, only dronabinol, bupropion, and gabapentin reduced withdrawal symptoms. In addition to reducing withdrawal symptoms, nabiximols/Sativex (a combination tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and cannabidiol nasal spray not available in the US) increased retention (while actively on the medication in an inpatient setting) but did not reduce outpatient cannabis use at follow-up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">All of the medications available for prescription in the US can be monitored reliably with urine drug screening to assess for illicit cannabis use except dronabinol, which will result in a positive screen for cannabis. When using urine drug screening, remember that for heavy cannabis users the qualitative urine drug screen can be positive for cannabis up to a month following cessation. When selecting a medication, take into account the cost of the medication, particularly since insurance will likely not cover THC agonists such as dronabinol for this indication, and possible misuse or diversion of scheduled substances (eg, dronabinol, nabilone). In addition, monitoring for reductions in substance use and withdrawal symptoms is key.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Abstinence initiation and relapse prevention</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Other clinical trials have looked at medications to promote abstinence by reducing stress-induced relapse, craving (not as a component of withdrawal), and the reinforcing aspects of cannabis. Of these trials, the following results show potential promise with positive findings: gabapentin reduced quantitative THC urine levels and improved cognitive functioning (in addition to decreasing withdrawal), and buspirone led to more negative urine drug screens for cannabis (although the difference was not significant compared with placebo). However, in a follow-up larger study, no differences were seen compared with placebo and women had worse cannabis use outcomes on buspirone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>N</em>-acetylcysteine resulted in twice the odds of a negative urine drug screen in young adults and adolescents (although there was no difference between adolescent groups in self-report of cannabis use).Gray and colleagues reported that no differences were seen between <em>N</em>-acetylcysteine and placebo (results of the trial are soon to be published). Topiramate resulted in significantly decreased grams of cannabis used but no difference in percent days used or proportion of positive urine drug screens.<sup>16</sup> In a recent small clinical trial, reductions in cannabis use were seen with oxytocin in combination with MET.<sup>17</sup>Studies with nabilone and long-term naltrexone administration reduced relapse and cannabis self-administration and subjective effects, respectively, which suggests promising avenues yet to be explored by clinical trials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Treatment of psychiatric comorbidity</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Other studies have looked at the effects of treating common comorbid psychiatric disorders in adults with cannabis use disorder, postulating that if the psychiatric disorder is treated, the individual may be more likely to abstain or reduce his or her cannabis use. For example, if a person is less depressed, he may better engage in CBT for relapse prevention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Fluoxetine for depression and cannabis use disorder in adolescents decreased cannabis use and depression, although there was no difference compared with placebo. A trial of venlafaxine for adults with depression and cannabis use disorder demonstrated less abstinence with greater withdrawal-like symptoms compared with placebo. These findings suggest that this antidepressant might not be beneficial for treatment-seeking individuals with cannabis use disorder and may actually negatively affect outcomes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em><strong>CASE VIGNETTE CONT&#8217;D</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>After discussing and presenting the different psychotherapy and medication treatment options to Mr. M, you and he decide to start CBT to help with abstinence initiation. In addition, you prescribe 20 mg of dronabinol up to 2 times daily in combination with 50 mg of naltrexone daily, to help globally target Mr. M’s withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse once abstinence is achieved. However, a few days later, Mr. M calls to say that his insurance will not cover the prescription for dronabinol and he cannot afford the high cost. Given his main concerns of cannabis withdrawal symptoms, you select gabapentin up to 400 mg 3 times daily and continue weekly individual CBT.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>Mr. M calls back several days later and reports that he has made some improvements in reducing the frequency of his cannabis use, which he attributes to the medication, but he thinks he needs additional assistance. After reviewing the treatment options again, he gives informed consent to start 1200 mg of N-acetylcysteine twice daily. After 10 weeks of this medication, his urine screens are negative.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>You continue to provide relapse prevention CBT. He reports to you that his anxiety and insomnia are almost resolved, and you suspect that withdrawal was the cause of these symptoms. He reports significant improvement in his relationship with his family and recently received a promotion at work for “going above and beyond” on a project he was given the lead.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>Over the next 6 months, he has 2 relapses that in functional analysis with you are determined to be triggered by unsolicited contact from his former drug dealer. Together, you develop a plan to block any further contact from the drug dealer. After several months, both the gabapentin and N-acetylcysteine are tapered and discontinued. Mr. M continues to see you for biweekly therapy sessions with random drug screens every 4 to 6 weeks.</em></span></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Based on the available evidence, gabapentin, THC agonists, naltrexone, and possibly <em>N</em>-acetylcysteine show the greatest promise in the off-label treatment of cannabis use disorders. System considerations, such as medication cost, need to be factored into the decision-making as well as combination medication and psychotherapy approaches, which—as demonstrated in the case of Mr. M—may ultimately work best. Until further research elucidates the standard of medication practices for cannabis use disorder, the best off-label medication strategy should target any co-occurring disorders as well as any identified problematic symptoms related to cannabis use and cessation of use. When available, referral for evidence-based psychotherapy should be made.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Abstract</span></h3>
<div class="">
<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">BACKGROUND:</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">There are conflicting interpretations of the evidence regarding the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of cannabinoids in pain management and palliative medicine.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">METHODS:</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">We conducted a systematic review (SR) of systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and prospective long-term observational studies of the use of cannabinoids in pain management and palliative medicine. Pertinent publications from January 2009 to January 2017 were retrieved by a selective search in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Medline. The methodological quality of the SRs was assessed with the AMSTAR instrument, and the clinical relevance of quantitative data syntheses was assessed according to the standards of the Cochrane Collaboration.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">RESULTS:</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Of the 750 publications identified, 11 SRs met the inclusion criteria; 3 of them were of high and 8 of moderate methodological quality. 2 prospective long-term observational studies with medical cannabis and 1 with tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol spray (THC/CBD spray) were also analyzed. There is limited evidence for a benefit of THC/CBD spray in the treatment of neuropathic pain. There is inadequate evidence for any benefit of cannabinoids (dronabinol, nabilone, medical cannabis, or THC/CBD spray) to treat cancer pain, pain of rheumatic or gastrointestinal origin, or anorexia in cancer or AIDS. Treatment with cannabis-based medicines is associated with central nervous and psychiatric side effects.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">CONCLUSION:</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The public perception of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of cannabis-based medicines in pain management and palliative medicine conflicts with the findings of systematic reviews and prospective observational studies conducted according to the standards of evidence-based medicine.</span></p>

        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In a backpacking hostel during a stag weekend 10 years ago, I fell asleep on a top bunk next to an open window. Of course, that now strikes me as a stupid thing to have done, but at the time I didn’t give it a thought. I was on a weekend away, not a health-and-safety awareness course. At some point during the night, I tried getting out of the bunk, but instead of turning left and using the ladder, I turned right and hopped straight out of the window.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">I fell 24ft on to concrete. From a survival point of view, I was lucky to land on my feet. The downside was that some rather important sections of my legs did not come out of it so well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">My left heel was crushed, while over on the right, my tibia and fibula – the two long bones in the lower leg – detached from their couplings and shattered. The next few weeks involved operations, plates, screws and quite unimaginable levels of agony. At one point, I felt a kind of blinding calm, as though <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/painkillers/">the pain had gone all the way up the scale</a> and rung a bell at the top.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">While those pain levels have never returned, over the years there have been generous helpings of it; my legs didn’t take too kindly to being smashed up and bolted back together, and they seem to enjoy reminding me of this. After trying many different ways of managing the pain, eight months ago I started taking cannabidiol, or CBD for short – a non-psychoactive compound found in both hemp and cannabis plants.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The effect on the pain has been profound. It comes as an oil that I put under my tongue whenever pain moves from a dull niggle to the kind that is difficult to ignore.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">CBD influences the release and uptake of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, leading to many potential therapeutic uses. Crucially, it does not contain any THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis; in other words, CBD does not get you high. Since last year, it has been legal to buy in the UK, after the government’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHPR) approved its use as a medicine under licence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">CBD oil has since been <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/23/medicalmarijuana-prescribed-11-year-old-nhs-first-time/">prescribed to an 11-year-old British boy suffering from epilepsy</a>, in what is believed to be the first instance of a cannabis-derivative being prescribed on the NHS.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Last month, a cancer patient diagnosed four years ago with an <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4865170/Woman-claims-cannabis-oil-CURED-brain-tumour.html" rel="nofollow">incurable brain tumour and given just six months to live</a>, ascribed her incredible recovery to turning to cannabis oil as a last resort.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">While research into the medical benefits of CBD oil is in its infancy, it is certainly encouraging. Recent reports suggest it could be a more useful anti-inflammatory than ibuprofen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“There has been some early scientific evidence that CBD can help with inflammation,” says Dr Henry Fisher, of drug policy thinktank Volteface.<strong> “</strong>There is also a lot of anecdotal evidence that it helps people who do contact sports, because of the tendency to get inflamed joints. Taking other anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen on a long-term basis – as many sportspeople do – is not a good idea because of potential damage to your liver.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It also has distinct advantages over opioid medicines, says Dr Fisher. “With CBD, there is no evidence of any long-term negative impact, and no likelihood of addiction. And, of course, there are <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/painkillers/">no known cases of anybody overdosing on CBD</a>.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The comparison to prescription medicine is particularly pertinent for me. For several months after my accident, I took Oxycontin, a common opioid painkiller. It was very useful at that time because it gave me a warm fuzzy feeling, making everything seem okay. But after a while, I started waking up feeling groggy and crushed. So I decided to stop, and the withdrawal was horrendous. It was several days of indescribable misery, so bad that it made the pain from the injuries feel like a slightly over-zealous massage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>Cannabidiol, or CBD, is one of more than 80 cannabinoids, natural compounds found in the marijuana plant. It is extracted from the plant via steam distillation and usually bottled with a dropper. Unlike THC, Tetrahydrocannabinol – the most abundant cannabinoid, CBD does not have an intoxicating effect.</em></span></p>
<h1 class="color"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>What does it do?</em></span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>Most studies of CBD’s effects are preclinical, but is been shown useful in treating social anxiety and lessening episodes of schizophrenia. The most complete research on the benefits of CBD is on treatment of childhood epilepsy and a plant-based medicine, Epidiolex is scheduled for FDA approval in the US.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>Another cannabis-based drug, Sativex, is already approved to relive the pain of muscle spasms in people suffering from multiple sclerosis. Clinical trials are also underway to test this category of drugs for cancer pain, glaucoma and appetite loss in people with HIV or AIDS.</em></span></p>
<h1 class="color"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>Is it legal?</em></span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>A low-concentration CBD oil is available in UK pharmacies as a health supplement. Campaigners have called for a high-concentration oil to also be made legal here. In December 2016, the government’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ruled that “products containing CBD used for medical purposes are a medicine”.</em></span></p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Getting off that heavy-duty medicine was key for my recovery. Because this kind of medication saps your energy, and the one thing you need to fight back to full fitness is energy. I spent months in a wheelchair, then on crutches, then finally I was able to start taking slow, painful steps on legs that had forgotten what their purpose was. I had always done a lot of sport, particularly martial arts – I got my black belt in kickboxing when I was 21 and spent some time working as an instructor. This training helped after the accident because I was in reasonably good shape – mashed bones notwithstanding – and I was used to pushing myself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">I never thought I would be able to fight again. So I just concentrated on simply being able to take care of myself. I also just got on with my life, somehow managing to acquire a lovely wife, daughter and son along the way. Then three years ago, I decided that the legs must have healed as much as they were ever going to, and I started doing martial arts again.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Rather than risk going back to kickboxing, <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/boxing/2017/08/18/conor-mcgregors-martial-art/">I took up Brazilian jiu-jitsu</a>, a grappling discipline where you subdue your opponent with chokes and joint-locks. If you watch beginners, it can look a bit like playground wrestling, but done properly it is graceful but deadly. I started off gently, but after a while I put the injuries behind me and trained as hard as ever. It was through the men I train with that I found out about CBD.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Everyone that uses it tells a similar story: they sleep better and feel less pain. While there are ongoing trials for CBD as a treatment for everything from multiple sclerosis to Parkinson’s disease, all I know is that for me it can make the difference being sitting on the sofa and being able to go training. I can now lift and carry my children without wincing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">CBD does not make the pain go away completely, but that is okay – a bit of pain is necessary, an alarm system to warn of imminent peril. But once the message has been received, it is nice to be able to turn the volume down a little bit.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Abstract</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">BACKGROUND:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Violence is a major concern and is prevalent across several mental disorders. The use of substances has been associated with an exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms as well as with violence. Compared to other substances such as alcohol and cocaine, existing literature on the cannabis-violence relationship has been more limited, with most studies being conducted in the general population, and has shown controversial results. Evidence has suggested a stronger relationship when examining the effects of the persistency of cannabis use on future violent behaviors. Though, while cannabis use is highly prevalent amid psychiatric patients, far less literature on the subject has been conducted in this population. Hence, the present prospective study aims to investigate the persistency of cannabis use in psychiatric patients.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">METHOD:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The sample comprised of 1,136 recently discharged psychiatric patients provided by the MacArthur Risk Assessment Study. A multi-wave (five-assessment) follow-up design was employed to allow temporal sequencing between substance use and violent behaviors. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to examine the effect of persistency of cannabis use on violence, while controlling for potential confounding factors. Potential bidirectional association was also investigated using the same statistical approach.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">RESULTS:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Our results suggest a unidirectional association between cannabis use and violence. GEE model revealed that the continuity of cannabis use across more than one time wave was associated with increased risks of future violent behavior.

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Marijuana advocates can no longer claim legalization is devoid of catastrophic results.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The Denver Post, which has embraced legalization, analyzed federal and state data and found results so alarming they published a story last week under the headline &#8220;Traffic fatalities linked to marijuana are up sharply in Colorado. Is legalization to blame?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Of course legalization is to blame. It ushered in a commercial industry that encourages consumption and produces an ever-increasing supply of pot substantially more potent than most users could find when the drug was illegal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The post reported a 40 percent increase in the number of all drivers, impaired or otherwise, involved in fatal crashes in Colorado between 2013 and 2016. That&#8217;s why the Colorado State Patrol posts fatality numbers on electronic signs over the highways.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;Increasingly potent levels of marijuana were found in positive-testing drivers who died in crashes in Front Range counties, according to coroner data since 2013 compiled by The Denver Post. Nearly a dozen in 2016 had levels five times the amount allowed by law, and one was at 22 times the limit. Levels were not as elevated in earlier years,&#8221; The Post explained.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">All drivers in marijuana-related crashes who survived last year tested at levels indicating use within a few hours of the tests.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;The trends coincide with the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado that began with adult use in late 2012, followed by sales in 2014,&#8221; the Post reported.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Greenwood Village Police Chief John Jackson called the trend &#8220;a huge public safety problem.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Colorado Springs Councilwoman Jill Gaebler, who wants a ballot measure to legalize recreational pot in Colorado Springs, tried to downplay the Post&#8217;s findings in a comment on Gazette.com.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;&#8230;33% or 196 of all traffic deaths that occurred in 2016 were alcohol-related,&#8221; Gaebler wrote. &#8220;Yet you don&#8217;t hear anyone trying to ban alcohol, even though it is far more dangerous, in every regard, to marijuana.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The Post found fatal crashes involving drivers under the influence of alcohol grew 17 percent from 2013 to 2015. Figures for 2016 were not available. Drivers testing positive for pot during that span grew by 145 percent, and &#8220;prevalence of testing drivers for marijuana use did not change appreciably, federal fatal-crash data show.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The entire country has an enormous problem with alcohol-related traffic fatalities. Given our inability to resolve that problem, it is arguably idiotic to throw another intoxicating substance into the mix with the predictable result of more traffic deaths caused by impairment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">El Paso County Commissioner Longinos Gonzalez gets it, as shown by a comment he left on gazette.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;Recent data indicates crime is up statewide, homelessness up, black and Hispanic teen arrests related to MJ are up a lot,&#8221; Gonzalez wrote. &#8220;A Denver TV station did a month long data poll last year at a hospital in Pueblo (which has fully embraced MJ) and found that nearly half of all newborns were testing positive for THC in their bloodstream at birth. Who would want to expand MJ sales in face of such data? And the big supporters of rec MJ can only fall back on their &#8216;go-to&#8217; arguments, that &#8216;it isn&#8217;t as bad as alcohol&#8217; or that the negative articles are biased or not credible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Another Gazette commenter expressed surprise at Gaebler&#8217;s &#8220;casual attitude&#8221; about the Denver Post&#8217;s findings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;&#8230;We already have alcohol, let&#8217;s add MJ, and why stop there — people want and need their opioids. Let there be drinking, toking, shooting up in our beautiful city,&#8221; the commenter wrote.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">One must stretch the imagination to deny that legalized pot has caused a substantial increase in Colorado highway deaths. Pot is an intoxicating, psychoactive drug. That means it cannot be harmless. Expect emerging and troubling data to make this fact increasingly clear.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Cannabis labelled ‘Sativa’ and ‘Indica’ may not come from distinct ancestries, according to a study performed by the Canadian Dalhousie University in cooperation with Bedrocan on the genetic differences between the two types and their hybrids. In this study 149 Dutch cannabis samples were analysed, correlating the genotype and chemotype to their reported ancestries. Indica- and Sativa-labelled samples were not as distinct as sub species would be assumed to be, but the genetic differences between them do correlate to their terpene profile (resin fragrance), which could explain the variation between them. Results of this new study have been presented on the <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://cannabinoidconference2017.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Association for Cannabis as Medicine (IACM) congress</a> in Cologne, Germany, September 2017.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">There is perhaps no debate in the world of cannabis more contentious than that of species. The genus <em><i>Cannabis sativa</i></em> L. is the only official species, but the terms ‘Sativa’, ‘Indica’ and ‘Hybrid’ have been widely adopted by cannabis breeders and cultivators as a way of advertising their product’s effects, aromas or purported pedigree. The degree to which these labels correspond to their actual ancestry, however, is dubious, and how this informal classification scheme relates to genotype or phenotype has been largely unexplored.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In the study an analysis of 149 cannabis samples was performed, correlating the genotype and chemotype (based on terpene and cannabinoid content of the flowers) to their reported ‘ancestry’.  The researchers then compared the reported labels to new scales they generated by reclassifying the samples based on their genetic and chemical similarity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The Indica/Sativa classification of Dutch cannabis does not correspond to distinct genetic lineages or to cannabinoid type, but there are genetic and chemical similarities that explain the variation between the groups. Deconvolution of the Indica-Sativa ancestry showed a strong relationship between the chemical and genetic profiles, suggesting that the distinct terpene contents of the types are heritable and important to the identity of these two groups. It is likely that strains are classified by their distinct aromas, and not their lineages, which has a direct impact on the genetics of this crop.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Bedrocan, worldwide producer of standardised medicinal cannabis, is already working on the terpene profiles that are associated with the current Bedrocan products. Hugo Maassen, head of the phyto engineering department at Bedrocan: “This study shows that the Indica/Sativa differences could be largely based on terpene content, which instead of the current Indica/Sativa labelling might require for more insight in the terpene profiles related to the Bedrocan products available for patient use.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The terpene profiles of the Bedrocan products are expected to be announced in the near future.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">LASSEN NATIONAL FOREST (KPIX 5) — It’s a massive crime scene, deep in Lassen National Forest.  Through dense ground cover and brutal terrain, federal agents are making their way to what might well qualify as an industrial-scale farm operation. There are living quarters, kitchens, bathrooms and trash dumps, all for the purpose of growing a lot of marijuana.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“This one was in excess of 15,000 plants,” said Stephen Frick, a special agent with the U.S. Forest Service.  A plant count that high requires multiple plots, across several miles, fed by an endless network of pipes, all drawing right from natural waterways. Scattered over all of this, there are the chemicals.  In every single direction there are fertilizers, poisons, and insecticides.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“The malathion, the pesticides a lot of the over the counter stuff, those are pretty common,” says Frick. “The uncommon ones are the restricted use pesticides like the carbofuran.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Carbofuran, an extremely toxic pesticide that’s effectively banned in the United States, is fast becoming a favorite tool among Mexican drug cartels, which operate in California’s public lands. Once a rare find, it’s now turning up at 60 to 70 percent of illegal grow sites, often mixed in bottles that have no warning label.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“A mountain biker, a hiker, a child, could be hiking out here, find this and think it’s a full bottle of vitamin water,” explained Dr. Mourad Gabriel, field agent for the Integral Ecology Research Center. “An eighth of a teaspoon would kill a 300 pound black bear.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">That is exactly what is happening.  Illegal growers aren’t just using carbofuran as an insecticide, they’re using it to kill anything that wanders into their grow sites. “If you want to kill wildlife, then let’s just go ahead and place poison in food, and have wildlife come,” says Gabriel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Bears that were photographed walking into camps contaminated with carbofuran were subsequently found dead, and agents are now routinely finding dead wildlife near grows, with testing often proving carbofuran to be the killer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The situation has become so toxic that hazardous materials experts are now involved, trying to figure out just how long carbofuran hangs around in our soil and water. “In order to determine how lethal this is,” said Gabriel. “Or how harmful this potentially may be for wildlife and humans.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The forest service is now approaching 400 illegal grow sites this year in California.  There is no specific designated budget for mitigating the sites, which are increasingly complicated and expensive to resolve with the presence of carbofuran.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The grows are an old problem, but the illegal, pink poison is just a new, lethal twist.  The toll it’s taking on our public lands is just starting to surface.  As Dr. Gabriel sees it, “the impact to wildlife and fisheries, this is a whole completely new frontier.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">As the legalization of marijuana continues to spread among various states within the U.S., researchers, and physicians are trying to fully grasp the potential health hazards of the recreational use of the drug. Since marijuana can be consumed through a variety of methods—e.g.<em>,</em> eating, smoking, or vaporizing—it is important to understand if and how drug delivery methods affect users. With that in mind, a recent study from investigators at Portland State University found benzene and other potentially cancer-causing chemicals in the vapor produced by butane hash oil, a cannabis extract.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Findings from the new study—published recently in <em>ACS Omega </em>in an article entitled “<a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsomega.7b01130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toxicant Formation in Dabbing: The Terpene Story</a>”—raises health concerns about dabbing, or vaporizing hash oil—a practice that is growing in popularity, especially in states that have legalized medical or recreational marijuana. Dabbing is already controversial. The practice consists of placing a small amount of cannabis extract (a dab) on a heated surface and inhaling the resulting vapor. The practice has raised concerns because it produces extremely elevated levels of cannabinoids—the active ingredients in marijuana.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“Given the widespread legalization of marijuana in the U.S., it is imperative to study the full toxicology of its consumption to guide future policy,” noted senior study author Robert Strongin, Ph.D., professor of organic chemistry at Portland State University. “The results of these studies clearly indicate that dabbing, while considered a form of vaporization, may, in fact, deliver significant amounts of toxins.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Dr. Strongin and his colleagues analyzed the chemical profile of terpenes—the fragrant oils in marijuana and other plants—by vaporizing them in much the same way as a user would vaporize hash oil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“The practice of &#8216;dabbing&#8217; with butane hash oil has emerged with great popularity in states that have legalized cannabis,” the authors wrote. “Despite their growing popularity, the degradation product profiles of these new products have not been extensively investigated.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The authors continued, stating that the current study focused on the “chemistry of myrcene and other common terpenes found in cannabis extracts. Methacrolein, benzene, and several other products of concern to human health were formed under the conditions that simulated real-world dabbing. The terpene degradation products observed are consistent with those reported in the atmospheric chemistry literature.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Many of the terpenes that the researchers discovered in the vaporized hash oil are also used in e-cigarette liquids. Moreover, previous experiments by Dr. Strongin and his colleagues found similar toxic chemicals in e-cigarette vapor when the devices were used at high-temperature settings. The dabbing experiments in the current study produced benzene—a known carcinogen—at levels many times higher than the ambient air, the researchers noted. It also produced high levels of methacrolein, a chemical similar to acrolein, another carcinogen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“The results of these studies clearly indicate that dabbing, although considered a form of vaporization, may, in fact, deliver significant amounts of toxic degradation products,” the authors concluded. “The difficulty users find in controlling the nail temperature put[s] users at risk of exposing themselves to not only methacrolein but also benzene. Additionally, the heavy focus on terpenes as additives seen as of late in the cannabis industry is of great concern due to the oxidative liability of these compounds when heated. This research also has significant implications for flavored e-cigarette products due to the extensive use of terpenes as flavorings.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15270" src="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-1-300x231.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="231" srcset="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-1-300x231.jpg 300w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-1-768x591.jpg 768w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-1.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 8pt;color: #0000ff">Research ecologist Mourad Gabriel is one of the few scientists studying illegal grow sites in California’s overrun national forests.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">On a hot August morning, Mourad Gabriel steps out of his pickup onto the gravel road that winds up the side of Rattlesnake Peak. Dark-bearded and muscular, the research ecologist sports a uniform of blue work clothes, sturdy boots and a floppy, Army-style camo hat. He straps on a pistol. “Just to let you know,” Gabriel says, sensitive to the impression the gun makes, “it’s public land, so I open-carry.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Another 100-degree day is promised. Gabriel and his four field assistants are headed to work in California’s Plumas National Forest, a few hours’ drive from Lake Tahoe, at the northern terminus of the Sierra Nevada. The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) has enlisted Gabriel to assess the scars from rampant marijuana cultivation. Today’s field site: an illegal marijuana plantation known as the Rattlesnake Grow.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Gabriel doesn’t take chances because he’s been threatened personally. In 2014, someone poisoned his family dog with a pesticide that’s used at the grow sites. The intruder crept onto Gabriel’s property at night and scattered poisoned meat in his backyard. And last year during raids on plots elsewhere in California, two police dogs were stabbed by men fleeing the scene.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">So whenever Gabriel enters a cultivation site with his research team — even one that’s been abandoned, as this one is — he always goes in first.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15271" src="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-2-300x231.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="231" srcset="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-2-300x231.jpg 300w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-2-768x591.jpg 768w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-2.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 8pt;color: #0000ff">U.S. Forest Service officers collect coils of plastic pipe used to divert water from springs to marijuana plants at an illegal grow site on public lands.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Most of the U.S. domestic marijuana supply is raised in California. Some pot is grown on private property for legal use by medical marijuana patients. These operations can be monitored, and with Californians having legalized recreational pot last November, the regulation is sure to tighten. But in popular pot-growing regions like Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity counties — closer to the Northern California coast in the so-called Emerald Triangle — environmental regulation has been slow to catch up. Commandeering streams, growers divert the water into high-tech greenhouses, to the detriment of the aquatic life lower in the drainage, including the threatened coho salmon. Biologists for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife have shown that thirsty marijuana plantations can dry up water sources.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">What’s more, the rest of the crop — the vast black-market portion — is planted on public or tribal lands by people who ignore the environmental consequences of their activity. When they’re captured, some turn out to be Mexican drug cartel workers, and others come from smaller independent groups. U.S. authorities concede that the great majority of these “trespass grows” are never detected. Even after sites are cleared, the shadowy growers may reclaim them the next year.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“The public doesn’t understand the industrial scale of this,” says wildlife biologist Craig Thompson.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But if you have heard anything about streams being polluted or animals and birds being poisoned by marijuana production, it’s almost certainly because of Gabriel, a soft-spoken scientist who now and then unleashes his inner Rambo.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>After the Bust</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Gabriel takes his team of biologists over the top of an open, sunbaked ridge and down the other side of the mountain. Immediately, burnt and toppled trunks of pine and fir and head-high tangles of wild lilac shrubs impede the way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Ten years ago, the Moonlight Fire destroyed 65,000 acres of forest in the Plumas. The marijuana growers stole into the broad footprint left by the blaze in dozens of places. In the section we’re hiking, they cut trails and cleared a series of plots on a steep slope above a ravine. Then the trespassers dug out three springs and diverted their flow into half-inch black plastic piping, which they threaded through the cover of vegetation to their network of plots below. The waterlines emptied into tarp-sealed pits that could store hundreds of gallons of water. Having started thousands of marijuana seedlings in plastic cups, the growers planted them among the shrubs throughout the plots. Each bright green plant was irrigated via drip lines, some triggered by a battery-powered timer. Although the mountainside faced north and east, light was no problem. Where it used to be blocked by trees, the strong California sun now slathered the crop.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Gabriel was with the rangers and deputies when they busted the site in 2015 and uprooted more than 16,000 plants. Judging by bags left around the site back then, he suspects at least 4,000 pounds of potent fertilizer were used. He also recorded several empty containers of a concentrated organophosphate insecticide — a lethal nerve poison that’s toxic to wildlife.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trouble-in-pot-country2.jpeg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15276" src="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trouble-in-pot-country2-503x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="440" height="897" srcset="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trouble-in-pot-country2-503x1024.jpeg 503w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trouble-in-pot-country2-147x300.jpeg 147w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trouble-in-pot-country2.jpeg 741w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Gabriel’s non-profit organization, Integral Ecology Research Center (IERC), was hired to assess the damage to water sources, soils and sensitive plants and animals. They also inventoried toxic waste, piping, camp materials and trash. Now it’s up to the Forest Service to decide how to repair the damage. Gabriel, enlisting local volunteer groups, will assist with the cleanup, too. The service he offers is soup-to-nuts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“He’s passionate. He’s a character,” says USFS’s Thompson, who collaborates with Gabriel on research. “He has continued to shine a light on the issue, though it’s still under the radar.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Connecting the Dots</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The first glimmer of impacts to wildlife came to Gabriel from fishers. A fisher — a type of weasel whose body is about the size of a housecat’s — is a denizen of deep woods. It has a wide face and long furry tail, and it can run up and down trees like the woodrats and squirrels it hunts. Fishers have never been overly abundant in the mountains of the West Coast, and their population plummeted after a century of logging and trapping. In the 21st century, biologists have tried to restore the Pacific fisher by reintroducing young animals and tracking them with radio collars. But the fishers’ expansion has been slow because they have been dying more rapidly than researchers expected.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Gabriel joined the fisher reintroduction project in 2009. At the time, he was completing his Ph.D. at the University of California, Davis. He credits an uncle for interesting him in the outdoors. The uncle was also a taxidermist; hence, young Mourad developed an interest in the interiors of animals. In high school, a vocational aptitude test suggested that he could be a game warden, park ranger or biologist. As an undergrad at Humboldt State University, he took courses supporting all three. Gabriel met his future wife, Greta Wengert, while they were both studying wildlife biology in college. After marrying, the two founded IERC in Blue Lake, Calif.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15272" src="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-3-300x231.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="231" srcset="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-3-300x231.jpg 300w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-3-768x591.jpg 768w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-3.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 8pt;color: #0000ff">Craig Thompson, a USFS biologist, drops a water filter into a High Sierra stream near a marijuana grow site. Tests have turned up pesticides and fertilizers coming from the grows.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Gabriel’s work for the fisher reintroduction project was lab-based. He conducted necropsies of dead animals that Thompson’s field researchers had picked up. Examining a fisher carcass one day, Gabriel found that its organs had turned to mush. The fisher had been poisoned by a compound that blocks clotting and prompts unchecked internal bleeding, a so-called second-generation anticoagulant rodenticide (AR). D-CON, commonly used against mice and rats, is a familiar brand of AR. But how did a forest carnivore absorb a pesticide typically used around farms and houses?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Gabriel remembers wondering if this one fisher was an outlier. “So we went back to the archival liver tissue,” he says. When he inspected frozen specimens and collected additional carcasses from colleagues, Gabriel discovered that rodenticides had, if not killed, then at least tainted 85 percent of expired fishers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“It took a while to connect the dots,” he says. From his field experience he was familiar with illegal pot grows, which had plagued the backcountry terrain for 20 years or more. “We’ve all run into it. We’ve been trained,” Gabriel says. “If you come upon a site, you do a 180 and walk away.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Mounds of Pesticide</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Law enforcement officers from different agencies asked him if rat bait from grow sites might be the culprit. It made sense; woodrats and squirrels would gnaw the marijuana plants.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">If the growers scattered AR and the rodents were sapped by internal bleeding, they would become easier prey for fishers. Bioaccumulation, as the process is known, would pass the rodenticide up the food chain, where concentrations increase. The fishers in turn might have become prey for bobcats and mountain lions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15273" src="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-4-300x231.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="231" srcset="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-4-300x231.jpg 300w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-4-768x591.jpg 768w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-4.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 8pt;color: #0000ff">Wildlife biologist Greta Wengert (above) carefully handles a suspected neurotoxin found in a Gatorade bottle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Raids turned up empty bags of AR and sometimes even mounds of the pesticide. To test their hypothesis about bioaccumulation, Thompson, Gabriel and state toxicologists tried to tie the levels of AR exposure in fishers with the locations of grow sites found by law enforcement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The researchers analyzed 46 female fishers that died over five years. Their results showed that the animals that lived longest had the least rodenticide in their livers and the fewest grow sites within their home ranges. Conversely, animals with roughly four or more grow sites nearby died the soonest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In a 2015 paper in the journal PLoS ONE, the researchers stepped back and examined all the causes of mortality in their collared fishers. Predation accounted for 70 percent of the deaths, disease an additional 16 percent, and poisoning, which until lately hadn’t been considered, 10 percent. The new factor might explain why fishers weren’t rebounding as fast as they might be. Pesticides might be the major factor in most of the deaths, even those not poisoned outright. “You can argue that the animals that are affected by rodenticide are weaker,” Thompson says, “and that the predation rates on them, as I suspect, are higher.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Sounding the Siren</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In a parallel case, rodenticides have worked their way into some of California’s northern spotted owls, a threatened species. The owls also eat tainted rodents near grow sites. The evidence here is less direct, and depends on analyses of a competing species, the barred owl. For decades, barred owls from Eastern states have been invading the breeding territory of the northern spotted owl in California, Oregon and Washington. Already on the ropes from the logging of old-growth woods, spotted owls were disappearing, and so biologists tried a desperate measure: shooting barred owls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">At the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation in Humboldt County, forestry biologist Mark Higley, who has helped with the fisher project, also takes part in the culling of barred owls. Higley says he and his staff have had run-ins with illegal growers, “taking risks we shouldn’t take.” After Gabriel’s breakthrough with AR and fishers, Higley sent him liver samples of more than 155 barred owls that had been collected at Hoopa. More than half were positive for rodenticide. Gabriel also had positive results from two spotted owls that were hit by cars. Since spotted owls are endangered, Higley and Gabriel use barred owls as a surrogate — their dietary habits are similar — and infer that up to half of spotted owls near grow sites might be exposed to rodenticide. Now Thompson is looking for other examples of bioaccumulation. He’s testing mountain lion scat for rat poison and pesticides.</span></p>

<div><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 8pt;color: #0000ff">Researchers examine a Pacific fisher carcass (left). The animals are struggling in part due to rat poison used by illegal marijuana growers</span></div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Only Gabriel, Thompson and a handful of other biologists are investigating the ecological effects of toxins from the trespass grows. The funding opportunities are scant, and the fieldwork is hard and potentially dangerous. Although growers who have been surprised at their plots haven’t hurt anybody — usually they just run away — sometimes shots are fired.Adding to the frustration, many important questions are nearly impossible to answer. At what levels do agricultural chemicals and rodenticide interfere with fishers’ reproduction? How much poison does it take to weaken an animal enough that it becomes easy prey for fishers and bobcats? Wildlife toxicology’s pitfall is that lab experiments can’t be performed on wild populations, let alone on sensitive and rare species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“You have these snippets of field-based evidence,” Gabriel says. “Maybe you could do a liver biopsy on a captive fisher, but it would cause bleeding, and if an anticoagulant were affecting the animal, [the test] could push it over the edge. I’ll leave that work to someone else.” His role, as he sees it, is sounding the siren. “The problem is getting worse,” he says, frustrated. “Who’s documenting this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>The Unseen Grower</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Amid the lilac shrubs, pungent with pollen, marks of the Rattlesnake Grow aren’t immediately obvious. Soon the paths and waterlines of the growers can be spotted, and then other items like fertilizer bags, heavy-duty plant shears and matted clothing, which the wilderness is swallowing up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">As Gabriel investigates a stream angling toward the ravine, the four techs split into pairs. Two young field biologists push off in opposite directions, using their GPS trackers to measure plot boundaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The slanting plot, still faintly pocked with bare spots where the marijuana grew, is about 50 yards wide and 100 yards long. They crisscross the area with cans of spray paint, tagging empty bags of chemicals as they count them. When they take a break, they huddle in the shade thrown by the charred trees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Walking on a diagonal line across the site, the biologists collect at least five samples of soil in plastic bags. The samples will be tested for various pesticides. Five samples for 1,500 square yards might not seem like much. “That’s all we can get funded for,” says Gabriel, who has rejoined the others. He reports spotting boot tracks. “I think they came back and took the tent and sleeping bags, probably sometime last spring.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15275" src="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-6-300x231.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="231" srcset="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-6-300x231.jpg 300w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-6-768x591.jpg 768w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/high-consequences-6.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 8pt;color: #0000ff">Growers often squat in primitive camps on public lands, leaving their mess to the Forest Service after harvest time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Of all the species Gabriel studies, the human animal — the unseen grower — is the hardest for him to figure out. “I’ve visited between 100 and 200 grow sites,” he says, leaning against a fallen tree. He wonders, why would growers plant so high up on this ridge with limited water?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“We saw a different approach last week,” Gabriel says. “Just 60 meters from a paved road they were growing 5,000 plants. Maybe one criminal organization decides, ‘We’ll go deep in the wilderness,’ and another, ‘Let’s put it by the road.’ You’re trading easier access for greater risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">He sees each site as a piece of a larger puzzle. If researchers could better understand the selection process, it might be possible to better handle these trespass grows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Later, over a beer in his motel room, Gabriel says, “There’s no way I can do this physically 15 or 20 years from now.” He figures he’s got eight more years, after which he hopes the field will be big enough for him to exit and do something else, leaving others to carry on the research. He’s trying to spur other biologists to study illegal grows too. He wants to track the long-term effects of the chemicals by incorporating specialties like hydrology and soil science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“As an ecologist, I love working on species of conservation concern,” he says. “I want a stable population of fishers and owls. I want basic research and applied management. Not science just for the sake of science but science as a solution.”</span></p>

Mike Pence, worries the marijuana lobby. They question Pence’s belief that marijuana is a gateway drug and its abuse is a crime, deserving penalty. While the marijuana lobby claims “Marijuana is a happy, healthy, wonderful plant and everybody should have the right to grow it, just as they grow <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://www.wthr.com/story/21752467/pence-questions-proposal-to-decrease-marijuana-penalties">dandelions,</a>” the National Insitute of Drugs (NIDA) findings support Pence’s objection to the legalization of marijuana.  According to NIDA’s latest available data, “illicit drug use in the U.S. is on the rise, and “More than half of new illicit drug users begin with marijuana.” Yet, marijuana legalization has become an issue in the U.S. presidential elections.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">How did we get here?</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The impresario who staged and pushed to legally dope of the American people is the billionaire financier George Soros. He found a kindred spirit in President Obama who got this <span class="s1">dog and pony </span><span class="s2">s</span>how on the road. The chosen vehicle was Obama-Care. And the first indication for this came on August 5, 2009, with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)’s little noticed tender for the production and distribution of large quantities of marijuana cigarettes, <span class="s1">for purposes other </span><span class="s2">than</span><span class="s3"> for research, </span><span class="s1">clocked</span> <span class="s3">under the DEA control and</span><span class="s1"> supposedly in</span> <span class="s3">compliance  with FDA regulations</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">According to pro-legalization activist <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/10/residents-in-these-8-states-are-set-to-vote-on-mar.aspx">Sean Williams</a>, “President Obama has suggested that the best way to get the attention of Congress is to legalize marijuana in as many states as possible at the state level. If a majority of states approve marijuana measures, and public opinion continues to swell in favor of cannabis, Congress may have no choice but to consider decriminalization — or legalize the substance.” <span class="s1">Not surprisingly, recently  there have been </span><span class="s2">widely-reported <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://www.smobserved.com/story/2016/06/18/news/us-govt-will-legalize-marijuana-on-august-1/1484.html"><span class="s3">leaks</span></a> from the </span><span class="s4">DEA  that the agency anticipates making “medical” marijuana” legal in all 50 states, even though this requires FDA approval.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Until the early 1990s, the voices to legalize drugs in the United States were not in sync. This changed with Soros’ first foray into U.S. domestic politics in 1992-1993. Soros, who made his fortune by bidding on instability, is known to say, “If I spend enough, I make it right.” While other billionaires give to the arts, higher education and medicine to better the quality of the lives of their fellow men, Soros chose to “right” illegal drug use, under the guise of a social reformer. “The war on drugs is doing more harm to our society than drug abuse itself.” Due to the widespread social and political opposition to illegal drug use, he chose to begin his efforts to “right” the situation, with a popular getaway drug, marijuana – a brain and mind altering drug that creates life-long dependency. To make his decision more palatable, the ultimate opportunistic Soros, declared marijuana is a “compassionate drug,” and for more than two decades poured tens of millions of dollars into campaigns to first legalize the use of “medical marijuana,” and more recently to decriminalize the use of “recreational” marijuana. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Pretending to support an “open society,” Soros,  uses his philanthropy to “change” or more accurately deconstruct the moral values and attitudes of the Western world, and particularly of the American people. He claims to support humanitarianism, equality and individual and political freedom, what Karl Pooper, the Austrian-born British philosopher argued were necessary for what he considered an “open society.”<span class="s1">nominal contact with Popper while studying at the London School of Economics. </span><span class="s1">Although Popper met with Soros once or twice while Soros was a student at the London School of Economics, Soros failed to make much of an impression on the old philosopher. According to Michael T. Kaufman’s 2003 <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.amazon.com/Soros-Life-Times-Messianic-Billionaire/dp/037570549X">unauthorized biography</a> of the billionaire, when Soros contacted Popper in 1982 to let him know about how he’d been naming funds, foundations, and various other entities after the concepts enshrined in the The Open Society, Popper wrote back: “Let me first thank you for not having forgotten me. I am afraid I forgot you completely; even your name created at first only the most minute resonance. But I made some effort, and now, I think, I just remember you, though I do not think I should recognize you.”</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Not surprisingly, Soros’ “open society” Institute and foundations are not about promoting any of Popper’s ideas. Certainly not freedom.  Instead, by working diligently to legalize drugs,<strong> Soros advances the greatest slavery ever–drug addiction</strong>. This sits well with his rejection of the notion of ordered liberty, in favor of a progressive ideology of rights and entitlements.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">On February 7, 1996, I opined in The Wall Street Journal that <strong>Soros’s “sponsorship unified the movement to legalize drugs and gave it the respectability and credibility it lacked</strong>.” I suggested “<strong>unchallenged, Soros would change the political landscape of America.”</strong> It took two decades and lots of money to achieve what he set out to get. For him, legalizing marijuana was a necessary stepping-stone to advancing drug policies in the U.S. and elsewhere toward legalizing the use of all drugs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Money is but one of the many possible speculations on Soros’s motivation to legalize drugs. If asked, he’ll respond with gibberish that makes no sense.  However, the revenues from the illegal drug trade are enormous. There are no other commodities on the market that yield such high and fast a return. Since 2014, legally listed marijuana producing and distributing companies will be generating huge revenues. Soros seems to believe that state-controlled drug distribution will best serve to increase dependency on the state.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><span class="s1">The overwhelming evidence </span><span class="s1">on the short and long term harm caused by marijuana to the user and </span><span class="s1">to society </span><span class="s1">should have stopped any attempt to legalize the drug. However, the vast amounts of money spent on influencing the public and the politicians generated the desired </span><span class="s1">social acceptance of the “compassionate drug,” marijuana. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In November 1996, Soros’ efforts <span class="s1">succeeded<b> </b></span>in California, making it the first state to legalize “medical marijuana.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span class="s1" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Recreational use of marijuana has nothing to do with medical marijuana. As with other drugs, the development of marijuana/cannabis as medicine has to follow modern medical rules – advancing with clinical trials with specific compounds, looking for side effects and interactions with other drugs, etc.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify"><span class="s1" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But when last November, the <span class="s2"><a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/drug-enforcement-administration/">DEA</a></span> Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg said, “We can have an intellectually honest debate about whether or not we want to legalize something that is bad and dangerous, but don’t call it medicine. That’s a joke.” Rosenberg opined there was a need for “legitimate research into the efficacy of marijuana for its constituent parts as a medicine. But I think the notion that state legislatures just decree it so is ludicrous.” The pro-drug lobby called for his dismissal. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Among the ill-effects of marijuana use (whether obtained legally or not) is memory loss, as proven by researchers at Northwestern University. The <a class="broken_link" style="color: #0000ff" href="http://www.redorbit.com/topics/thalamus/">study also found</a> “evidence of brain alterations … significant deterioration in the thalamus, a key structure for learning, memory, and communications between brain regions.”  If this were not enough, the study <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1113028919/marijuana-effects-on-the-brain-similar-to-schizophrenia-121613/">concluded</a>, “chronic marijuana use could “memory-related structure [to] shrivel and collapse.s..[and] boosts the underlying process driving schizophrenia.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This study as many others documented the devastating long-term harm caused by marijuana use. Another National Institute on Drug Abuse <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana">(NIDA)</a> study found that “marijuana smoke contains 50% to 70% more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke … which further increases the lungs’ exposure to carcinogenic smoke.” Moreover, “marijuana users have a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of heart attack in the first hour after smoking the drug. … This risk may be greater in aging populations or those with cardiac vulnerabilities.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Other studies documented “distorted perceptions, impaired coordination, difficulty in thinking and problem-solving, and problems with learning and memory.”  As a result, someone who smokes marijuana every day may be functioning at a suboptimal intellectual level all of the time.” In conclusion: “Research clearly demonstrates that marijuana has the potential to cause problems in daily life or make a person’s existing problems worse. In fact, heavy marijuana users generally report lower life satisfaction, poorer mental and physical health, relationship problems, and less academic and career success compared to their peers who came from similar backgrounds. For example, marijuana use is associated with a higher likelihood of dropping out from school. Several studies also associate workers’ marijuana smoking with increased absences, tardiness, accidents, workers’ compensation claims, and job turnover.” NIDA’s latest survey from 2013, show that drug users are exacting more than <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/nationwide-trends">$700 billion annually</a> in costs related to crime, lost work productivity and health care. Add yo this the cost of newly hooked Americans on social welfare, including food stamps, Obamacare, public housing, free cell phones, and other entitlements.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Moving to relax Federal oversight on marijuana use, a Department of Justice <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/cole-DOJ-memo-aug-2013.pdf">memo</a> on August 29, 2013, clarified the government’s prosecutorial priorities and stated that the federal government would rely on state and local law enforcement to “address marijuana activity through enforcement of their own narcotics laws.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">When Colorado legalized the use of “recreational” use of marijuana, on January 1, 2014, the TSA announced it stopped deploying detection dogs in the state’s airports, even though these dogs are trained to also detect other illegal drugs, explosives, blood, contraband electronics, stashed currency, and more. Similar measures will take place once marijuana is legalized, exposing American airport to terrorist attacks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The Obama’s endorsed and Soros’ funded Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, has <a class="broken_link" style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/what-president-obamas-legacy-means-me/">promised</a> to “defend and build on the progress…made under President Obama,” including his and the billionaire’s efforts to legalize marijuana. American voters should keep this in mind when voting for their next President.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">National Families in Action has remade some of the graphs and charts in the report to emphasize key findings. This one shows how many of Colorado&#8217;s students were expelled, referred to law enforcement, or suspended in the 2015-2016 school year. This is the first year the Colorado Department of Education differentiated marijuana violations from all drug violations, and this year&#8217;s report will serve as a baseline to determine whether marijuana violations increase, decrease, or stay fundamentally the same.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The new report explains that although Colorado created its own Healthy Kids Survey, the combination of a poor response rate and the fact that several major counties with large populations had low or no participation rendered the 2015 survey&#8217;s results invalid. For a discussion of this see page 33 (PDF page 41). Volume 5 relies on the National Survey on Drug Use and Health to compare Colorado marijuana use with the national average for ages 12-17, 18-25, and 26 &amp; older over a ten year period (2005-2006 to 2014-2015).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">SAM is a nonpartisan alliance of lawmakers, scientists and other concerned citizens who want to move beyond simplistic discussions of &#8220;incarceration versus legalization&#8221; when discussing marijuana use and instead focus on practical changes in marijuana policy that neither demonizes users nor legalizes the drug. SAM supports a treatment, health-first marijuana policy.  SAM has four main goals:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">To inform public policy with the science of today&#8217;s marijuana.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">To reduce the unintended consequences of current marijuana policies, such as lifelong stigma due to arrest.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">To prevent the establishment of &#8220;Big Marijuana&#8221; &#8211; and a 21st-Century tobacco industry that would market marijuana to children.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">To promote research of marijuana&#8217;s medical properties and produce, non-smoked, non-psychoactive pharmacy-attainable medications.</span></li>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">ABSTRACT:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Background </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The number of people entering specialist drug treatment for cannabis problems has increased considerably in recent years. The reasons for this are unclear, but rising cannabis potency could be a contributing factor. Methods Cannabis potency data were obtained from an ongoing monitoring programme in the Netherlands. We analysed concentrations of δ -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) from the most popular variety of domestic herbal cannabis sold in each retail outlet (2000–2015). Mixed effects linear regression models examined time-dependent associations between THC and first-time cannabis admissions to specialist drug treatment. Candidate time lags were 0–10 years, based on normative European drug treatment data. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Results </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">THC increased from a mean (95% CI) of 8.62 (7.97–9.27) to 20.38 (19.09–21.67) from 2000 to 2004 and then decreased to 15.31 (14.24–16.38) in 2015. First-time cannabis admissions (per 100 000 inhabitants) rose from 7.08 to 26.36 from 2000 to 2010, and then decreased to 19.82 in 2015. THC was positively associated with treatment entry at lags of 0–9 years, with the strongest association at 5 years, b = 0.370 (0.317–0.424), p &lt; 0.0001. After adjusting for age, sex and non-cannabis drug treatment admissions, these positive associations were attenuated but remained statistically significant at lags of 5–7 years and were again strongest at 5 years, b = 0.082 (0.052–0.111), p &lt; 0.0001. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Conclusions</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> In this 16-year observational study, we found positive time-dependent associations between changes in cannabis potency and first-time cannabis admissions to drug treatment. These associations are biologically plausible, but their strength after adjustment suggests that other factors are also important.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">New research suggests that marijuana users may be more likely than nonusers to misuse prescription opioids and develop prescription opioid use disorder. The study was conducted by researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), part of the National Institutes of Health, and Columbia University.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The investigators analyzed data from the <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.healthdata.gov/dataset/national-epidemiologic-survey-alcohol-and-related-conditions-nesarc%E2%80%94wave-1-2001%E2%80%932002-and">National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions</a>, which interviewed more than 43,000 American adults in 2001-2002, and followed up with more than 34,000 of them in 2004-2005. The analysis indicated that respondents who reported past-year marijuana use in their initial interview had 2.2 times higher odds than nonusers of meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for prescription opioid use disorder by the follow-up. They also had 2.6 times greater odds of initiating prescription opioid misuse, defined as using a drug without a prescription, in higher doses, for longer periods, or for other reasons than prescribed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A number of recent papers suggest that marijuana may reduce prescription opioid addiction and overdoses by providing an alternate or complementary pain relief option. That suggestion is partly based on comparisons of aggregate data from states that legalized marijuana for medical use vs. those that didn’t. In contrast, the current study focuses on individual marijuana users vs. nonusers and their trajectories with regard to opioid misuse and disorders. These findings are in-line with previous research demonstrating that people who use marijuana are more likely than non-users to use other drugs and develop problems with drug use.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Drug Free America Foundation launched its new <em>Marijuana and the Workplace Tool Kit</em> this morning at a forum co-sponsored with Drug Free Manatee and the Manatee Chamber of Commerce at Pier 22 in Bradenton FL.  The forum featured a presentation by Amy Ronshausen, Deputy Director of Drug Free America Foundation who unveiled the <em>Tool Kit</em> and discussed how the implementation of Florida’s medical marijuana program will affect employers in the state. The forum also included a panel discussion with a group of experts that includes healthcare and labor attorneys, insurance representatives and a state legislator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">            As marijuana legalization efforts gain traction around the country as it has in Florida, the business community needs to be prepared.  “Employers must be diligent and proactive in understanding how the use of marijuana affects individuals, the overall influence to their business, and the level of financial liability that is acceptable,” according to Calvina Fay, executive director of Drug Free America Foundation.  “It is critical that an evaluation be completed based upon legitimate science, the safety-sensitive nature of the business, and risk analysis as opposed to perception and emotion,” she said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Employees that use marijuana and other drugs negatively impact the bottom line for employers due to increased workplace accidents, injuries, and other effects, increasing the cost of doing business.  “The safety of all employees, vendors, customers, other drivers, pedestrians, or generally anyone encountering an employee while driving under the influence of pot could be impacted,” said Fay.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The tangled web of conflicting and diverse laws and statutes being drawn across the country varies from state to state, from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, making this issue very confusing for all concerned.  No two states’ marijuana laws are identical, further complicating the issue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Identifying and defining liability related to marijuana use is perhaps one of the most evolving areas of risk management and insurance practices.  “From the viewpoint of an insurer, the conflicting laws are particularly troublesome for insuring a business against unexpected loss with no clear best practice and can potentially impact workers compensation claims and well as health, life and other business insurance coverage and premiums,” Fay suggested.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A smart approach for employers is to implement workplace practices that encourage safe, healthy lifestyles, and discourage behaviors that are counter-productive, both from a personal and a business standpoint. “In this tumultuous time of conflicting laws, confusion, and change, employers are encouraged to stay the course where a drug-free workplace is concerned,” continued Fay.  “We also encourage employers to remain consistent and fair in the application of workplace rules and procedures and to regularly review their program in relation to applicable laws, regulations and statutes that may have changed,” she concluded.</span></p>

<p id="__p2" class="p p-first-last"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Since marijuana legalization, pediatric exposures to cannabis have increased, resulting in increased pediatric emergency department (ED) visits. Neurologic toxicity is most common after pediatric exposure; however, gastrointestinal and cardiopulmonary toxicity are reported. According to a retrospective review of 986 pediatric cannabis ingestions from 2005 to 2011, pediatric exposure has been specifically linked to a multitude of symptoms including, but not limited to, drowsiness, lethargy, irritability, seizures, nausea and vomiting, respiratory depression, bradycardia and hypotension.Prognosis is often reassuring. </span></p>
<p class="p p-first-last"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Specific myocardial complications related to cannabis toxicity that are well documented in adolescence through older adulthood include acute coronary syndrome, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, pericarditis, dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest. To date, there are no reported pediatric deaths from myocarditis after confirmed, recent cannabis exposure. The authors report an 11-month-old male who, following cannabis exposure, presented in cardiac arrest after seizure and died. Myocarditis was diagnosed post-mortem and cannabis exposure was confirmed. Analyses of serum cannabis metabolites, post-mortem infectious testing, cardiac histopathology, as well as clinical course, support a potential link between the cannabis exposure and myocarditis that would justify preventive parental counseling and consideration of urine drug screening in this reported setting.</span></p>

The patient was lethargic for two hours after awakening that morning and then had a seizure. During the prior 24–48 hours, he was irritable with decreased activity and was later retching. He was noted to be healthy before developing these symptoms. Upon arrival in the ED, he was unresponsive with no gag reflex. Vital signs were temperature 36.1° Celsius, heart rate 156 beats per minute, respiratory rate 8 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 80% on room air. </span></p>
<p class="p p-first"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Physical exam revealed a well-nourished, 20.5 lb., 11-month-old male, with normal development, no trauma, normal oropharynx, normal tympanic membranes, no lymphadenopathy, tachycardia, clear lungs, normal abdomen and Glasgow Coma Scale rating of 4. He was intubated for significant CNS depression and required no medications for induction or paralysis. Post-intubation chest radiograph is shown in <a class="fig-table-link figpopup" style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5965161/figure/f2-cpcem-01-166/" target="figure" rel="noopener noreferrer">Image 2</a>. He subsequently became bradycardic with a heart rate in the 40s with a wide complex rhythm. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and is shown in <a class="fig-table-link figpopup" style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5965161/figure/f1-cpcem-01-166/" target="figure" rel="noopener noreferrer">Image 1</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p p-first"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">He then became pulseless, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated. Laboratory analysis revealed sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 7.7 mmol/L, chloride 115 mmol/L, bicarbonate 8.0 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 24 mg/dL, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, and glucose 175 mg/dL Venous blood gas pH was 6.77. An ECG was repeated (<a class="fig-table-link figpopup" style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5965161/figure/f3-cpcem-01-166/" target="figure" rel="noopener noreferrer">Image 3</a>). He received intravenous fluid resuscitation, sodium bicarbonate infusion, calcium chloride, insulin, glucose, ceftriaxone and four doses of epinephrine.

CBC demonstrated white blood cell count 13.8 K/mcL with absolute neutrophil count of 2.5 K/mcL and absolute lymphocyte count of 10.7 K/mcL, hemoglobin 10.0 gm/dL, hematocrit 34.7%, and platelet count 321 K/mcL. LFTs showed total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 77 IU/L, and alanine transferase 97 IU/U. A single blood culture from the right external jugular vein revealed aerobic gram-positive rods that were reported two days later as Bacillus species (not <em>Bacillus anthracis</em>). Toxicology screening revealed urine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay positive for tetrahydrocannabinol-carboxylic acid (THC-COOH) and undetectable serum acetaminophen and salicylate concentrations. Route and timing of exposure to cannabis were unknown.</span></p>
<p id="__p5" class="p p-last"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Autopsy revealed a non-dilated heart with normal coronary arteries. Microscopic examination showed a severe, diffuse, primarily lymphocytic myocarditis, with a mixed cellular infiltrate in some areas consisting of histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. Myocyte necrosis was also observed. There was no evidence of concomitant bacterial or viral infection based on post-mortem cultures obtained from cardiac and peripheral blood, lung pleura, nasopharynx and cerebrospinal fluid. Post-mortem cardiac blood analysis confirmed the presence of Δ-9-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ-9-carboxy-THC) at a concentration of 7.8 ng/mL. Additional history disclosed an unstable motel-living situation and parental admission of drug possession, including cannabis.</span></p>

<h2 id="__sec3title" class="head no_bottom_margin ui-helper-clearfix"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">DISCUSSION</span></h2>
<p id="__p6" class="p p-first"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">As of this writing, this is the first reported pediatric death associated with cannabis exposure. Given the existing relationship between cannabis and cardiovascular (CV) toxicity, as well as the temporal progression of events, post-mortem analysis, and previously reported cases of cannabis-induced myocarditis, the authors propose a relationship between cannabis exposure in this patient and myocarditis, leading to cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This occurrence should justify consideration of urine drug screening for cannabis in pediatric patients presenting with myocarditis of unknown etiology in areas where cannabis is widely used. In addition, parents should be counseled regarding measures to prevent such exposures.</span></p>
<p id="__p7"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The progressive clinical presentation of this patient during the prior 24–48 hours, including symptoms of somnolence, lethargy, irritability, nausea, seizure and respiratory depression are consistent with previously documented, known complications of recent cannabis exposure in the pediatric population. It is well known that common CV effects of cannabis exposure include tachycardia and decreased vascular resistance with acute use and bradycardia in more chronic use. These effects are believed to be multifactorial, and evidence suggests that cannabinoid effect on the autonomic nervous system, peripheral vasculature, cardiac microvasculature, and myocardial tissue and Purkinje fibers are all likely contributory. The pathogenesis of myocarditis is not fully understood. In general, myocarditis results from direct damage to myocytes from an offending agent such as a virus, or in this case, potentially a toxin. The resulting cellular injury leads to a local inflammatory response. Destruction of cardiac tissue may result in myocyte necrosis and arrhythmogenic activity, or cellular remodeling in chronic myocarditis.</span></p>
<p id="__p8"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Autopsy findings in this patient were consistent with noninfectious myocarditis as a cause of death. The histological findings of myocyte necrosis with mature lymphocytic mixed cellular infiltrate are consistent with drug-induced, toxic myocarditis.The presence of THC metabolites in the patient’s urine and serum, most likely secondary to ingestion, is the only uncovered risk factor in the etiology for his myocarditis. This is highly unlikely attributable to passive exposure.</span></p>
<p id="__p9"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It is difficult to extrapolate a specific time of cannabis ingestion given the unknown dose of THC, the individual variability of metabolism and excretion, as well as the lack of data on this topic in the pediatric population and post-mortem redistribution (PMR) kinetics. However, the THC metabolite detected in the patient’s blood, Δ-9-carboxy-THC, is known to peak in less than six hours and be detectable for at least a day, while the parent compound, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is expected to rapidly metabolize and distribute much more quickly, being potentially undetectable six hours after exposure in an infrequent user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The parent compound was below threshold for detection in this patient’s blood. In addition, if cannabis ingestion occurred the day of presentation, it would have been more likely that THC would have been detected with its metabolite after PMR. Given this information, the authors deduce that cannabis consumption occurred within the recent two to six days, assuming this was a single, acute high-potency ingestion. This time frame would overlap with the patient’s symptomatology and allow time for the development of myocarditis, thus supporting cannabis as the etiology.</span></p>
<p id="__p10"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The link between cannabis use and myocarditis has been documented in multiple teenagers and young adults. In 2008 Leontiadis reported a 16-year-old with severe heart failure requiring a left ventricular assist device, associated with biopsy-diagnosed myocarditis.The authors attributed the heart failure to cannabis use of unknown chronicity. In 2014 Rodríguez-Castro reported a 29-year-old male who had two episodes of myopericarditis several months apart.Each episode occurred within two days of smoking cannabis.In 2016, Tournebize reported a 15-year-old male diagnosed with myocarditis, clinically and by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, after initiating regular cannabis use eight months earlier. There were no other causes for myocarditis, including infectious, uncovered by these authors, and no adulterants were identified in these patients’ consumed marijuana.Unlike our patient, all three of these previously reported patients recovered.</span></p>
<p id="__p11"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In the age of legalized marijuana, children are at increased risk of exposure, mainly through ingestion of food products, or “edibles.”These products are attractive in appearance and have very high concentrations of THC, which can make small exposures exceptionally more toxic in small children.</span></p>
<p id="__p12" class="p p-last"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Limitations in this report include the case study design, the limitations on interpreting an exact time, dose and route of cannabis exposure, the specificity of histopathology being used to classify etiology of myocarditis, and inconsistent blood culture results. The inconsistency in blood culture results also raises concern of a contributing bacterial etiology in the development of myocarditis, lending to the possibility that cannabis may have potentially induced the fatal symptomatology in an already-developing silent myocarditis. However, due to high contaminant rates associated with bacillus species and negative subsequent blood cultures, the authors believe this was more likely a contaminant. In addition, the patient had no source of infection on exam or recent history and was afebrile without leukocytosis. All of his subsequent cultures from multiple sites were negative.</span></p>

<h2 id="__sec4title" class="head no_bottom_margin ui-helper-clearfix"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p id="__p13" class="p p-first-last"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Of all the previously reported cases of cannabis-induced myocarditis, patients were previously healthy and no evidence was found for other etiologies. All of the prior reported cases were associated with full recovery. In this reported case, however, the patient died after myocarditis-associated cardiac arrest. Given two rare occurrences with a clear temporal relationship – the recent exposure to cannabis and the myocarditis-associated cardiac arrest – we believe there exists a plausible relationship that justifies further research into cannabis-associated cardiotoxicity and related practice adjustments. In states where cannabis is legalized, it is important that physicians not only counsel parents on preventing exposure to cannabis, but to also consider cannabis toxicity in unexplained pediatric myocarditis and cardiac deaths as a basis for urine drug screening in this setting.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In a large observational study of veterans, the researchers found an increase in participants who experienced a heightening of their PTSD symptoms when using medical marijuana.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The study looked at evidence from 47,000 veterans dealing with PTSD from 1992 to 2011.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">From this group of veterans, the researchers could not conclusively say that medical marijuana has benefits when dealing with people with PTSD.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">US Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin said: &#8216;My opinion is, is that some of the states that have put in appropriate controls, there may be some evidence that this is beginning to be helpful. And we&#8217;re interested in looking at that and learning from that.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But the VA does not prescribe medical marijuana to its veterans currently.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8216;Until the time that federal law changes, we are not able to be able to prescribe medical marijuana for conditions that may be helpful,&#8217; Shulkin said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Marijuana is legal for medical and recreational use in eight states: Massachusetts, Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, Nevada, California and Maine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It is also legal for strictly medical use in the District of Columbia and 21 states: Montana, North Dakota, Arizona, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware and Hawaii.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The restrictions on marijuana studies are partly due to the Drug Enforcement Agency&#8217;s hesitation on allowing medical marijuana across the US.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">LONDON (Reuters) &#8211; People who smoke marijuana have a three times greater risk of dying from hypertension, or high blood pressure, than those who have never used the drug, scientists said on Wednesday. </span><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The risk grows with every year of use, they said. </span><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The findings, from a study of some 1,200 people, could have implications in the United States among other countries. Several states have legalized marijuana and others are moving toward it. It is decriminalized in a number of other countries.</span></p>
<div class="cli cli-text" style="text-align: justify">
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“Support for liberal marijuana use is partly due to claims that it is beneficial and possibly not harmful to health,” said Barbara Yankey, who co-led the research at the school of public health at Georgia State University in the United States. </span><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">“It is important to establish whether any health benefits outweigh the potential health, social and economic risks. If marijuana use is implicated in cardiovascular diseases and deaths, then it rests on the health community and policy makers to protect the public.” </span><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Marijuana is also sometimes used for medicinal purposes, such as for glaucoma. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The study, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, was a retrospective follow-up study of 1,213 people aged 20 or above who had been involved in a large and ongoing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In 2005–2006, they were asked if they had ever used marijuana.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="cli cli-text" style="text-align: justify">
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">For Yankey’s study, information on marijuana use was merged with mortality data in 2011 from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, and adjusted for confounding factors such as tobacco smoking and variables including sex, age and ethnicity. </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The average duration of use among users of marijuana, or cannabis, was 11.5 years. </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The results showed marijuana users had a 3.42-times higher risk of death from hypertension than non-users, and a 1.04 greater risk for each year of use. </span><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">There was no link between marijuana use and dying from heart or cerebrovascular diseases such as strokes.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="cli cli-text" style="text-align: justify">
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Yankey said were limitations in the way marijuana use was assessed ― including that researchers could not be sure whether people had used the drug continuously since they first tried it. </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But she said the results chimed with plausible risks, since marijuana is known to affect the cardiovascular system. </span><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">“Marijuana stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increases in heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen demand,” she said.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="cli cli-text" style="text-align: justify">
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Experts not directly involved in the study said its findings would need to be replicated, but already raised concerns. </span><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">“Despite the widely held view that cannabis is benign, this research adds to previous work suggesting otherwise,” said Ian Hamilton, a lecturer in mental health at Britain’s York University.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><a class="" style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/kanye_west/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye West</a> is suing his tour&#8217;s insurer after the company allegedly refused to pay for his canceled shows in November &#8211; and blamed his cannabis use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The rapper was forced to cancel the last 21 shows of his North American tour after he had a mental breakdown and had to be checked into a hospital.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">While his insurer Lloyd&#8217;s of London would normally cover the costs, the company said they don&#8217;t have to pay because his marijuana use caused the breakdown.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The 40-year-old is asking for $10 million in damages from Lloyd&#8217;s, claiming the company has yet to pay him out for his cancelled shows, and has no intent to do so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">His company said in a legal document filed on Tuesday that insurers have yet to pay and is &#8216;implying that Kanye&#8217;s use of marijuana may provide them with the basis to deny the claim&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Here, Daily Mail Online takes a closer look at how marijuana use could cause psychosis and potentially cause a mental breakdown, as Lloyd&#8217;s claims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Marijuana legalization began in the United States in 1996, when California legalized the drug for medical use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">That sparked a wave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In the next decade, 14 states followed suit: Oregon, Alaska, Washington, Maine, Hawaii, Nevada, Colorado, Montana, Vermont, New Mexico, Michigan, New Jersey, Arizona and Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Then in 2012, Colorado and Washington state legalized the drug for recreational use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Now, just five years later, marijuana is legal for medical and recreational use in eight states: Massachusetts, Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, Nevada, California and Maine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It is also legal for strictly medical use in the District of Columbia and 21 states: Montana, North Dakota, Arizona, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware and Hawaii.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The wave has given rise to a booming industry of edibles, dispensaries, cannabis healthcare professionals, and paraphernalia.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Marijuana is the national favorite according to a report published by Addictions.com, making up more than 70 percent of all drug use in the United States.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But experts warn researchers are struggling to keep up with the pace of legalization, and there are still many gaps in our knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">However, some experts warn people are using the drug to self medicate for things like depression and anxiety despite research showing it does more harm than good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In fact, there research shows that increased risk of depression as a result of frequent marijuana use is thought to be behind psychosis&#8217; onset. The two mental health conditions have previously been linked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8216;A number of people choose to self medicate, but it could actually make things like anxiety and depression worse,&#8217; Dr Lucy Troup, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at Colorado State University told Daily Mail Online.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8216;We can&#8217;t fully understand yet the brain mechanisms that cause mental illness, but we&#8217;ve seen a clear link between marijuana use and users who report psychotic breaks. But again, it&#8217;s different for every person.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In California medical marijuana can be used as a treatment for anxiety. In the other states and DC, someone suffering from anxiety or depression can apply for a medical marijuana license if their conditions are considered to be severe and debilitating.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">COULD CANNABIS TREAT MIGRAINES?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Chemicals in cannabis could be effective at treating painful migraines, research revealed last month.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Cannabinoids, the compounds in marijuana that make you feel high, may be better at treating pain than recommended migraine medication, a study found.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Researchers from the Interuniversity Center in Florence found that pills containing the chemicals reduce the pain felt by migraine sufferers by 43.5 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The drug also had a number of additional effects, including stopping stomach aches and muscle pain, according to the researchers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Previous research has found cannabis reduces migraines by targeting cells in the body that control pain relief and inflammation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">CAN MARIJUANA USE CAUSE A PSYCHOTIC BREAK?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Psychosis is defined as a condition that affects the mind and causes the sufferer to lose touch with reality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Symptoms include:</span></p>
<ul class="mol-bullets-with-font" style="text-align: justify">
<li class=""><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">delusions and hallucinations</span></li>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Studies have found that marijuana is thought to cause psychosis-like experiences by increasing a user&#8217;s risk of depression. The two mental health conditions have been linked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Frequently abusing the substance also significantly reduces a user&#8217;s ability to resist socially unacceptable behavior when provoked, research suggests.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8216;We don&#8217;t understand the precise mechanisms for psychosis, but there is clear research that supports that cannabis use can lead to it,&#8217; Dr Lucy Troup, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at Colorado State University told Daily Mail Online.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8216;I can&#8217;t comment particularly on Kanye West&#8217;s case, because I don&#8217;t know a lot about him other than what the media says. But there are different variables that could have made it more likely such as how long it&#8217;s been used, when someone first started, how concentrated or potent the drug is that they are using, how they are taking it, and their specific genotype.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Drug-induced psychosis is most commonly associated with LSD or amphetamines, but can also be caused by marijuana, cocaine and alcohol.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Results of a study by the University of Montreal revealed that going from being an occasional marijuana user to abusing the substance once a week or as often as every day, increases the risk of psychosis-like experiences by 159 percent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The results also demonstrated that marijuana use reduces a person&#8217;s ability to resist socially unacceptable behavior in response to a particular stimulus.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">KANYE WEST&#8217;S PAST MARIJUANA USE: COULD THE DRUG HAVE CAUSED THE RAPPER&#8217;S MENTAL BREAK?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In the past Kanye has been candid about his weed habit. He&#8217;s made multiple references in his songs. He also admitted to smoking before the 2015 Video Music Awards where he infamously announced his 2020 presidential candidacy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Dr Troup explained that while she doesn&#8217;t know much about the rapper&#8217;s circumstance in particular, she was surprised to hear that Lloyd&#8217;s of London isn&#8217;t paying out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">She said that if a bank makes that claim about anyone, be it Kanye or someone less well known, the process to support that claim is long and complicated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8216;There isn&#8217;t enough knowledge about his [Kanye&#8217;s] medical history for anyone but his doctor to say for sure what caused his mental break,&#8217; Dr Troup explained. &#8216;It would be a long and complicated process because they would have to look at his blood work, a hospital report, and a number of other things.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8216;I&#8217;m guessing when you insure a rock star you have to expect these kinds of things,&#8217; she added.</span></p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">CASE REPORT</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">               A healthy 13-month-old, 12-kg female presented to the ED with injected conjunctiva and inappropriate staring for 2 h, followed by a half-hour period of somnolence. The mother denied any possible ingestions, fevers, vomiting, seizures, or head trauma. Birth and medical history were unremarkable.</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">        Growth and development were age appropriate. On presentation, patient was somnolent, but arousable with stimulation. Vital signs were: temperature 36.6C, heart rate of 127 beats/min, respiratory rate of 39 breaths/min, blood pressure of 98/66mmHg, and an SpO2 of 100% on room air. Pupils were equal and dilated to 6mm bilaterally.</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. Computed tomography of the head, chest x-ray study, electrocardiogram, complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and serum toxicology were unremarkable.</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">       The mother appeared intoxicated, with slurred speech and injected conjunctiva. Maternal cannabinoid intoxication was suspected and urine cannabinoids on the child were sent and returned positive. Upon result disclosure, the mother stated that the child recently consumed hemp seed milk. Urine gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) confirmatory test was positive for d-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Within 8 h, the child returned to baseline without any medical interventions other than observation. Poison control, social work, and child protection services were all notified and involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">DISCUSSION</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">           Cannabis is one of the most abused drugs worldwide. Cannabis formulations, such as marijuana (dried, leaves), hashish (resin), and hashish oil (concentrated resin extract) can be inhaled or ingested. THC is the main psychoactive ingredient that binds to brain cannabinoid receptors, producing dose- and time-dependent stimulant, hallucinogenic, or sedative effects. Effects of inhaled cannabis occur within minutes after ingestion, peak within 15–30 min, and last up to 4 h post ingestion.</span></p>
<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">INTRODUCTION</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">          Cannabis is a psychoactive plant composed of more than 500 chemical components called cannabinoids, which exert their psychoactive effect by activating specific receptors in the central nervous system and immune system. Cannabinoids are among the most abused drugs worldwide, with an estimated 22.2 million users in the United States. Since 2017, medical marijuana has been legalized in 31 states, and 9 states have decriminalized recreational marijuana. In such states, emergency department (ED) visits and poison center calls for accidental cannabis intoxication have increased. With these changes, emergency physicians must be adept in recognizing unintentional cannabis toxicity in young children, as intoxication can result in encephalopathy and coma.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">     Orally consumed cannabis has delayed effects, with onset ranging from 30 min to 3 h, lasting up to 12 h post ingestion. With the increased bioavailability of cannabis concentrates and the smaller body mass in children, toddler cannabis ingestion results in high serum THC levels, despite a small amount ingested.</span></p>
<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">     Pediatric cannabis intoxication has variable presentations, ranging from mentation changes to encephalopathy and coma. The most common symptoms are central nervous system depression (i.e., lethargy, coma), confusion, agitation, hypotonia, bilateral reactive mydriasis, and ataxia. Nausea and vomiting have been reported, along with bradycardia, bradypnea, hypotension, and respiratory depression necessitating mechanical ventilation. Other symptoms include tremor, hallucinations, nystagmus, slurred speech, and muscle weakness. With such nonspecific </span><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">symptomatology, cannabis toxicity can mimic postictal states, encephalitis,or sepsis, which lead to unnecessary diagnostic evaluations.</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">    Prompt urine screening can prevent further invasive and costly workups, such as brain imaging and lumbar puncture, and may thwart the need for mechanical ventilation or i.v. antibiotics/antivirals for presumed meningoencephalitis. Initial urine screening is typically performed with the highly sensitive enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique, but can have false-positive results, as many drug metabolites can influence the test, including hemp seed products. The confirmatory test, GC-MS, will only test positive for THC, making it highly specific for cannabis ingestion.</span></p>
<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">       Hemp is derived from a strain of the cannabis sativa plant species that contains a much </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">lower concentration of the psychoactive component, THC, and higher concentrations of cannabidiol. Due to the increased availability in natural grocery stores, hemp products have become increasingly popular as health supplements in children. In order for hemp products to be commercially sold in the United States, strict regulations enforce the THC component to be &lt; 0.3% of the total product weight. Despite these strict regulations on THC content, a recent study byYang et al. demonstrated that hemp products, in fact, have a variable THC component and may contain up to 12 times the legal THC limit. Therefore, prolonged use of hemp seed oil may induce neurologic symptoms of THC. </span></span></p>
<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">       A recent case by Chinello et al. described a case of a 2-year-old child who developed neurologic symptoms after taking 2 teaspoons of hemp seed oil per day for 3 weeks. </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">No antidote exists for cannabis toxicity and activated charcoal is not effective. Management is largely supportive and most pediatric patients are observed and return to baseline within 8–12 h. Pediatric cannabis intoxication should be reported to child protection services to identify neglect and at-risk families and enhance child safety.</span></span></p>
<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">       Pediatric cannabis ingestions are more frequent due to rising marijuana use in the United States (US). In a comparison of state trends in unintentional pediatric marijuana exposures, as measured by call volume to US poison centers, call rates in states that had passed legislation prior to 2005 were increased by 30%, juxtaposed to non-legal states, where call volume remained unchanged. Despite its increasing availability, reports of unintentional pediatric cannabis ingestion leading to toxicity are uncommon. History taking must review both medicinal and recreational drug exposures to prevent missing the diagnosis. Knowledge of substances that can lead to false positives is imperative. Pertinent to our case, hemp product consumption will not result in a positive cannabinoid urine confirmatory test, as hemp does not contain enough THC to induce toxicity. However, recent data show hemp seed oil products may have substantially more THC than the level acceptable for commercial hemp use, and with prolonged exposure may induce toxicity. Our case involved an acute exposure and is therefore unlikely to cause any related toxicities.</span></p>
<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">      Lastly, with the growing popularity of edible marijuana products, which typically resemble candy and may be alluring to the exploratory toddler, emergency physicians must be vigilant when considering potential cannabis toxicity.</span></p>
<p class="has-text-color" style="color: #0000ff;text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">As access to cannabis increases, emergency physicians must recognize pediatric unintentional cannabis toxicity. Prompt cannabinoid urine screening can prevent further invasive diagnostic investigations.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Dear David,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> I am sending you below a copy of a letter I have sent to the Premiers of Canada – and other members of the worldwide drug prevention community, plus an email to UN HQ in New York.   Since they get so many letters I thought it </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">would be sensible to send you a copy direct as it might take time for you to receive it through UN internal mail.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Dear Premiers,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">As members of the worldwide drug prevention community we have been reading with increasing concern and disbelief the way that Canada seems to be bulldozing through legislation that can only damage the citizens of your country – not the least the children.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The Rights of the Child Treaty, under article 33 of the international drug conventions, would be breached if this legislation is allowed to be ratified.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Under the terms of the convention, governments are required to <strong>meet children’s basic needs </strong>and help them <strong>reach their full potential</strong>. Since it was adopted by the United Nations in November 1989, <strong>194 countries </strong>have signed up to the UNCRC,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"><strong>United Nations Conven</strong><strong>tion on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is an important international legal </strong><strong>instrument that obligates States Parties to protect children and youth from involvement with illicit drugs and the drug trade</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Canada is a signatory to the CRC – which is a legally binding document.  Should your country go ahead with the decision to legalise marijuana – against all the evidence from respected scientists and Health authorities worldwide Canada would be an outcast by those 193 nations who have agreed and signed to Article 33.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">We find it astonishing that the wealth of evidence and opinion in Canada and  worldwide,  on the harmfulness of marijuana would seem to have been totally ignored by your parliamentarians.   Indeed new evidence relating to the epidemic of gastrochisis was submitted in good time by our Australian colleague Dr. Stuart Reece and was not allowed to be presented.   Instead you have been persuaded by groups that want marijuana to be ‘the new tobacco’ – headed of course by George Soros, that this will not be harmful to your citizens, that it will bring in tax revenues and that it would destroy the black market. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">However, there was a <a href="http://www.cclt.ca/Resource%20Library/CCSA-Cost-of-Cannabis-Collisions-Canada-Infographic-2017-en.pdf">study </a>done a few weeks ago by the <u>Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse and Addiction</u> finding that just in Canada alone, a much smaller country than the U.S. in population, <u>marijuana-related car crashes cost a billion dollars.</u> That&#8217;s just the car crashes, and those were directly related to marijuana. And the report came from a government think tank, not any kind of anti-drug group.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">We heard many of these same promises in 2012 when Colorado legalized recreational marijuana. Yet  in the years since, Colorado has seen an increase in marijuana related traffic deaths, poison control calls, and emergency room visits. The marijuana black market has increased in Colorado, not decreased. And, numerous Colorado marijuana regulators have been indicted for corruption.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">New reports out of Colorado indicate that legal marijuana  is posing real risks to the safety of young people. As Colorado rethinks marijuana, the rest of the nation should watch carefully this failing experiment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Healthcare officials representing <a href="http://www.chieftain.com/news/pueblo/4696333-120/pueblo-cannabis-marijuana-health">three hospitals in Pueblo, Colorado, issued a statement </a>on April 27 in support of a ballot measure that would end Marijuana commercialization in the city and county of Pueblo. “We continue to see first-hand the increased patient harm caused by retail marijuana, and we want the Pueblo community to understand that the <u>commercialization of marijuana is a significant public health and safety issue</u>,” said Mike Baxter, president and CEO of Parkview Medical Center.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Among their concerns are  a 51 percent increase in number of children under 18 being treated in Parkview Medical Center emergency rooms.  Furthermore, of newborn babies at St. Mary-Corwin Hospital, drug tested due to suspected prenatal exposure, nearly half tested positive for marijuana.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Having read the above, how can Canadian legislators possibly believe that legalising marijuana would, in any way, be advantageous for their country ?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Yours faithfully,</span></p>

		<p> A three-month-old baby boy died after being left alone overnight while his mother smoked cannabis, a serious case review has found. </p>
<p>Social services dealt repeatedly with the child&#8217;s family before his death but closed the case after the woman said she had stopped using drugs. </p>
<p>A police investigation into potential neglect is currently ongoing. The review found the level of support provided to the family was &#8220;a proportionate response&#8221;. </p>
<p>The baby, who can be identified only as Child E, suffered a cardiac arrest in September 2017 after being found unresponsive with a blanket over his head at a home in Rochdale. </p>
<p>His mother, who also cannot be named, subsequently told police she had been using cannabis on the night before his death and had left the house between 01:00 and 02:00 BST to go to a local garage. The baby had been left lying in his pram for 12 hours without being checked. </p>
<p><strong>Substance misuse </strong></p>
<p>A serious case review by the Rochdale Borough Safeguarding Children Board found the family had interacted with police and health and social care workers repeatedly in the months before his death. </p>
<p>An anonymous referral made to Children&#8217;s Social Care also raised concerns about the mother&#8217;s substance misuse and the state of the home in which the family were living, the Board found. </p>
<p>The Board&#8217;s report said the mother &#8220;reported cannabis to be her drug of choice and cocaine less frequently.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;It is true that many parents&#8217; use of drugs does not present a risk of harm to their children. It is also true that many parents who use drugs have chaotic and unpredictable lifestyles that do impact on their ability to maintain stability and safe parenting of their children,&#8221; it said. </p>
<p>Despite this, the case was closed after the mother said she had stopped using drugs. </p>
<p><strong>Risk<br />
</strong><br />
&#8220;This review therefore begs the question about how well professionals can be reassured that substance misuse that impacts on parenting is ever really resolved or whether some level of risk will always remain,&#8221; the report said. </p>
<p>It also found that the mother had been given detailed advice on safe sleeping guidelines for babies on three occasions. </p>
<p>&#8220;The learning from this review will be important to all agencies and will result in changes to procedures in line with the recommendations,&#8221; said the Board&#8217;s independent chair, Jane Booth. </p>

<p>A new study finds traffic accidents are increasing in states that have legalized recreational marijuana, Bloomberg reports. </p>
<p>Crashes have risen by as much as 6 percent in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, compared with neighboring states that haven’t legalized marijuana for recreational use, according to research from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI). </p>
<p>“The new IIHS-HLDI research on marijuana and crashes indicates that legalizing marijuana for all uses is having a negative impact on the safety of our roads,” IIHS-HLDI President David Harkey said in a news release. “States exploring legalizing marijuana should consider this effect on highway safety.” </p>
<p>In a separate study, IIHS examined police-reported crashes before and after retail marijuana sales began in Colorado, Oregon and </p>
<p>Washington. The study found the three states combined saw a 5.2 percent increase in the rate of crashes per million vehicle registrations, compared with neighboring states that did not legalize marijuana.</p>

		<p>Anybody wondering what happens to the 8 per cent of the skunk-smoking population who develop mental illness should visit any psychiatric hospital in Britain or speak to somebody who has done so What is really needed in dealing with cannabis is a “tobacco moment”, as with cigarettes 50 years ago, when a majority of people became convinced that smoking might give them cancer and kill them. Since then the number of cigarette smokers in Britain has fallen by two-thirds.  </p>
<p>A depressing aspect of the present debate about cannabis is that so many proponents of legalisation or decriminalisation have clearly not taken on board that the causal link between cannabis and psychosis has been scientifically proven over the past ten years, just as the connection between cancer and cigarettes was proved in the late 1940s and 1950s. </p>
<p>The proofs have emerged in a series of scientific studies that reach the same grim conclusion: taking cannabis significantly increases the risk of schizophrenia. One study in The Lancet Psychiatry concludes that “the risk of individuals having a psychotic disorder showed a roughly three times increase in users of skunk-like cannabis, compared with those who never used cannabis”.   As 94 per cent of cannabis seized by the police today is super-strength skunk, compared to 51 per cent in 2005, almost all those who take the drug today will be vulnerable to this three-fold increase in the likelihood that they will develop psychosis.  </p>
<p>Mental health professionals have long had no doubts about the danger. Five years ago, I asked Sir Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, about them. He said that studies showed that “if the risk of schizophrenia for the general population is about one per cent, the evidence is that, if you take ordinary cannabis, it is two per cent; if you smoke regularly you might push it up to four per cent; and if you smoke ‘skunk’ every day you push it up to eight per cent”.  </p>
<p>Anybody wondering what happens to this 8 per cent of the skunk-smoking population should visit any mental hospital in Britain or speak to somebody who has done so. Dr Humphrey Needham-Bennett, medical director and consultant psychiatrist of Cygnet Hospital, Godden Green in Sevenoaks, explained to me that among his patients “cannabis use is so common that I assume that people use or used it. It’s quite surprising when people say ‘no, I don’t use drugs’.”  </p>
<p>The connection between schizophrenia and cannabis was long suspected by specialists but it retained its reputation as a relatively benign drug, its image softened by the afterglow of its association with cultural and sexual liberation in the 1960s and 1970s.  </p>
<p>This ill-deserved reputation was so widespread that even 20 years ago, the possible toxic side effects of cannabis were barely considered. Zerrin Atakan, formerly head of the National Psychosis Unit at the Maudsley Psychiatric Hospital and later a researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry, </p>
<p>said: “I got interested in cannabis because I was working in the 1980s in an intensive care unit where my patients would be fine after we got them well. We would give them leave and they would celebrate their new found freedom with a joint and come back psychotic a few hours later.”  </p>
<p>She did not find it easy to pursue her professional interest in the drug. She recalls: “I was astonished to discover that cannabis, which is the most widely used illicit substance, was hardly researched in the 1990s and there was no research on how it affected the brain.” She and fellow researchers made eight different applications for research grants and had them all turned down, so they were reduced to taking the almost unheard of course of pursuing their research without the support of a grant.  </p>
<p>Studies by Dr Atakan and other psychiatrists all showed the connection between cannabis and schizophrenia, yet this is only slowly becoming conventional wisdom. Perhaps this should not be too surprising because in 1960, long after the link between cigarettes and lung cancer had been scientifically established, only a third of US doctors were persuaded that this was the case.  </p>
<p>A difficulty is that people are frightened of mental illness and ignorant of its causes in a way that is no longer true of physical illnesses, such as cancer or even HIV. I have always found that three quarters of those I speak to at random about mental health know nothing about psychosis and its causes, and the other quarter know all too much about it because they have a relative or friend who has been affected.  </p>
<p>Even those who do have experience of schizophrenia do not talk about it very much because they are frightened of a loved one being stigmatised. They may also be wary of mentioning the role of cannabis because they fear that somebody they love will be dismissed as a junkie who has brought their fate upon themselves. </p>
<p>This fear of being stigmatised affects institutions as well as individuals. Schools and universities are often happy to have a policy about everything from sex to climate change, but steer away from informing their students about the dangers of drugs. A social scientist specialising in drugs policy explained to me that the reason for this is because “they’re frightened that, if they do, everybody will think they have a drugs problem which, of course, they all do”. </p>
<p>The current debate about cannabis – sparked by the confiscation of the cannabis oil needed by Billy Caldwell to treat his epilepsy and by William Hague’s call for the legalisation of the drug – is missing the main point. It is all about the merits and failings of different degrees of prohibition of cannabis when it is obvious that legal restrictions alone will not stop the 2.1 million people who take cannabis from going on doing so. But the legalisation of cannabis legitimises it and sends a message that the government views it as relatively harmless. The very fact of illegality is a powerful disincentive for many potential consumers, regardless of the chances of being punished.  </p>
<p>The legalisation of cannabis might take its production and sale out of the hands of criminal gangs, but it would put it into the hands of commercial companies who would want to make a profit, advertise their product and increase the number of their customers. Commercialisation of cannabis has as many dangers as criminalisation. </p>
<p>A new legal market in cannabis might be regulated and the toxicity of super-strength skunk reduced. But the argument of those who want to legalise cannabis is that the authorities are unable to enforce regulations when the drug is illegal, so why should they be more successful in regulating it when its production and sale is no longer against the law?  </p>
<p>The problem with these rancorous but sterile arguments for and against legalisation and decriminalisation is that they divert attention from what should and can be done: a sustained campaign to persuade people of all ages that cannabis can send them insane. To a degree people are learning this already from bitter experience. As Professor Murray told me five years ago, the average 19- to 23-year-old probably knows more about the dangers of cannabis than the average doctor “because they have a friend who has gone paranoid. People know a lot more about bad trips than they used to.” </p>

		<p>According to a Colorado Springs Gazette editorial about legalization in Colorado there has been a doubling of drivers involved in fatal crashes testing positive for marijuana. [1]  </p>
<p>Marijuana significantly impairs driving including time and distance estimation and reaction times and motor coordination. [2] The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration lists marijuana as the most prevalent drug in fatally injured drivers with 28 % testing positive for marijuana. [3]  </p>
<p>It is true that the crash risk for a driver on alcohol is higher than on marijuana. But to suggest it is safe to drive after using marijuana is irresponsible. An even greater danger is the combination of alcohol and marijuana that has severe psychomotor effects that impair driving. [4] </p>
<p>What about our kids? Vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among those aged 16-25. [5] Weekend nighttime driving under the influence of marijuana among young drivers has increased by 48%. [6] About 13 % of high school seniors said they drove after using marijuana while only 10 % drove after having five or more drinks.[7] Another study showed about 28,000 seniors each year admitted to being in at least one motor vehicle accident after using marijuana. [8] </p>
<p>The marijuana industry is backing legalization. Do we want more dangerous drivers on our roads and dead kids so the industry can make money from selling marijuana? </p>

<p>LEGALIZING POT WILL CAUSE MORE OPIATE USE  </p>
<p>Legalizing marijuana will cause more marijuana use. Marijuana use is associated with an increased risk for substance use disorders. [1] The interaction between the opioid and the cannabinoid system in the human body might provide a neurobiological basis for a relationship between marijuana use and opiate abuse.[2] Marijuana use appears to increase rather than decrease the risk of developing nonmedical prescription opioid use and opioid use disorder. [3] In 2017, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) landmark report written by top scientists concluded after a review of over 10,000 peer-reviewed academic articles, that marijuana use is connected to progression to and dependence on other drugs, including studies showing connections to heroin use. [4] </p>
<p>New research suggests that marijuana users may be more likely than nonusers to misuse prescription opioids and develop prescription opioid use disorder. The investigators analyzed data from more than 43,000 American adults. The respondents who reported past-year marijuana use had 2.2 times higher odds than nonusers of meeting diagnostic criteria for prescription opioid use disorder. They also had 2.6 times greater odds of initiating prescription opioid misuse. [5] </p>
<p>Marijuana used as a medicine is being sold as reducing the need for other medicines. However, a new study shows that medical marijuana users were significantly more likely to use prescription drugs in the past 12 months. Individuals who used medical marijuana were also significantly more likely to report nonmedical use in the past 12 months of any prescription drug with elevated risks for pain relievers, stimulants and tranquilizers.

<p>MARIJUANA USE BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER PREGNANCY CAN CAUSE SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS, LEARNING PROBLEMS, AND BIRTH DEFECTS  </p>
<p>Legalizing marijuana will cause more marijuana use among women of child bearing age. Prenatal marijuana use has been linked with: </p>
<p> 1. Developmental and neurological disorders and learning deficits in children.</p>
<p> 3. Premature birth, miscarriage, stillbirth. </p>
<p> 4. An increased likelihood of a person using marijuana as a young adult. </p>
<p> 5. The American Medical Association states that marijuana use may be linked with low birth weight, premature birth, behavioral and other problems in young children.  </p>
<p> 6. Birth defects and childhood cancer. </p>
<p> 7. Reproductive toxicity affecting spermatogenesis which is the process of the formation of male gamete including meiosis and formation of sperm cells. </p>
<p>Moderate concentrations of THC, the main psychoactive substance in marijuana, when ingested by mothers while pregnant or nursing, could have long-lasting effects on the child, including increasing stress responsivity and abnormal patterns of social interactions. THC consumed in breast milk could affect brain development.   </p>

<p>MARIJUANA EXPOSURES AMONG CHILDREN INCREASE BY UP TO OVER 600% </p>
<p>The rate of marijuana exposures among children under the age of six increased by 610% in the “medical” marijuana states according to a study published in Clinical Pediatrics. The data comes from the National Poison Data System. 75% percent of the children ingested edible marijuana products such as marijuana-infused candy. Clinical effects include drowsiness or lethargy, ataxia [failure of muscle coordination], agitation or irritability, confusion and coma, respiratory depression, and single or multiple seizures.  </p>

<p>FACTS FROM COLORADO </p>
<p>The people who are pushing marijuana legalization paint Colorado as a pot paradise. This is not true according to Peter Droege who is the Marijuana and Drug Addiction Policy Fellow for the Centennial Institute a policy think tank in Lakewood Colorado. In a April 20, 2018 opinion article he states that:  </p>
<p>According to the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), Colorado is a national leader among 12-17-year-olds in (1) Last year marijuana use; (2) Last month marijuana use; and (3) The percentage of youth who tried marijuana for the first time. </p>
<p>A 2017 analysis by the Denver Post showed Colorado had experienced a 145% increase in the number of fatal crashes involving marijuana-impaired drivers between 2013 and 2016. While the analysis stresses that the increase cannot definitively be attributed to the legalization of marijuana, it reports that the number of marijuana-impaired drivers involved in fatal crashes has more than doubled since 2013, the year before the state legalized recreational marijuana use. </p>
<p>A July 20, 2016 article in Westword magazine reports that increased homelessness, drugs, and crime are causing local residents and convention visitors to shun Denver’s 16th Street Mall, once one of the most vibrant tourist destinations in the region. </p>
<p>A group of concerned scientists from Harvard University and other institutions wrote a letter to Governor Hickenlooper on March 10, 2017, seeking to correct the record after his Feb. 26, 2017, interview on Meet the Press in which he told Chuck Todd that Colorado had not seen a spike in youth drug use after the legalization of recreational marijuana, and that there was “anecdotal” evidence of a decline in drug dealers &#8211; claims he repeated in Rolling Stone. </p>
<p>In the letter, the scientists reference numerous studies, including the NSDUH survey, that report a dramatic increase in youth marijuana use, emergency room visits, mental health issues and crime tied to the legalization of marijuana in Colorado. They quote an official from the state&#8217;s attorney general’s office saying legalization “has inadvertently helped fuel the business of Mexican drug cartels &#8230; cartels are now trading drugs like heroin for marijuana, and the trade has since opened the door to drug and human trafficking.” </p>
<p>Today’s high-potency “crack weed” is marketed to youth through vapes, candies, energy drinks, lip balms and other products easy to conceal in homes and schools. Most dispensaries in Colorado are located in low-income neighborhoods, targeting young people who do not need another obstacle in fulfilling their great potential in life. * </p>

<p>55% of marijuana users surveyed by the Colorado Department of Transportation last November said they believed it was safe to drive under the influence of marijuana. Within that group, the same percentage said they had driven high in the past 30 days, on average 12 times. A recent analysis of federal traffic fatality data by the Denver Post found that the number of Colorado drivers involved in fatal crashes who tested positive for marijuana has doubled since 2013. </p>

<p>TODDLERS WITH LUNG INFLAMMATION </p>
<p>In Colorado one in six infants and toddlers hospitalized for lung inflammation are testing positive for marijuana exposure. This has been a 100% increase since legalization (10% to 21%). Non-white kids are more likely to be exposed than white kids. </p>

<p>TEEN ER VISITS </p>
<p>Marijuana related emergency room visits by Colorado teens is substantially on the rise. They see more kids with psychotic symptoms and other mental health problems and chronic vomiting due to marijuana use. </p>

<p>LOW BIRTH WEIGHTS </p>
<p>The Colorado School of Public Health reports that there is a 50% increase in low birth weights among women who use marijuana during pregnancy. Low birth weight sets the stage for future </p>
<p>health problems including infection and time spent in neonatal intensive care. </p>

<p>EMERGENCY CARE </p>
<p>Colorado Cannabis Legalization and Its Effect on Emergency Care </p>
<p>&#8220;Not surprisingly, increased marijuana use after legalization has been accompanied by an increase in the number of ED visits and hospitalizations related to acute marijuana intoxication. Retrospective data from the Colorado Hospital Association, a consortium of more than 100 hospitals in the state, has shown that the prevalence of hospitalizations for marijuana exposure in patients aged 9 years and older doubled after the legalization of medical marijuana and that ED visits nearly doubled after the legalization of recreational marijuana, although these findings may be limited because of stigma surrounding disclosure of marijuana use in the prelegalization era. However, this same trend is reflected in the number of civilian calls to the Colorado poison control center. In the years after both medical and recreational marijuana legalization, the call volume for marijuana exposure doubled compared with that during the year before legalization. </p>

<p>CONTAMINATION OF MARIJUANA PRODUCTS </p>
<p>There is contamination in marijuana products in Colorado. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment claims that “Cannabis is a novel industry, and currently, no recognized standard methods exist for the testing of cannabis or cannabis products.” </p>

		<p>Unified Police Sgt. Melody Gray described the process as similar to making a pipe bomb. </p>
<p>But some marijuana users — and dealers — are willing to take that risk despite potentially dangerous results. </p>
<p>For the past several years, law enforcement in several states have been combating the increasing popularity of something called &#8220;dabs.&#8221; Dabs, or hash oil concentrate, are made by extracting THC from marijuana plants. Other similar concentrate products include marijuana wax and &#8220;shatter.&#8221; </p>
<p>While marijuana typically contains about 15 percent THC, a dab has 80 to 90 percent THC, said Unified police detective Orin Neal. </p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a greater high, it&#8217;s a more intense high,” he said, noting that the potency makes it dangerous. </p>
<p>But in order to get that extraction, a solvent is needed, and dab producers typically use butane, which is why dabs are also referred to as butane hash oil. And sometimes, those attempting to extract THC using butane try to speed up the process by adding a heating element such as a hot plate. </p>
<p>Neal said the combination of butane and heat or an open flame often results in explosions. </p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a recipe for disaster, really,” Neal said. </p>
<p>Police say that&#8217;s what happened June 26, when a 33-year-old woman was critically injured in an explosion in a basement at 3329 S. Scott Ave. </p>
<p> &#8220;In this situation and many other situations, I think it happens accidentally. They’re doing this operation in an area that’s not properly ventilated. And because butane is so combustible and highly flammable, any exposure to any open flame — from a pilot light on a water heater or a furnace in a house to an oven to lighting a cigarette in a house or anything like that — could cause a huge explosion, which is what happened the other day,” he said. </p>
<p>Neal said the result was like a bomb going off inside the small, enclosed basement room. </p>
<p>Dabs have become a nationwide trend. In some states, the drug and the dangerous manufacturing of it have been a problem for law enforcers for several years. </p>
<p>&#8220;The use of butane has caused multiple explosions all over the country, including one in a university housing complex near the University of Montana in October of 2014. These explosions have killed and severely burned people of all ages nationwide. The explosions are also causing serious structural damage to property and neighboring properties,&#8221; officer Jermaine Galloway wrote in Utah State Trooper magazine in 2017. </p>
<p>Some states have made possession of dabs a felony crime while marijuana possession is a misdemeanor. Utah does not distinguish between the two. </p>
<p>The fad has only recently become an issue in Utah. But police fear as it catches on and more people attempt to manufacture their own dabs, it will become like the meth lab problem of 30 years ago. </p>
<p>Neal said he has seen two or three explosions locally due to THC extraction. </p>
<p>The dab trend &#8220;is currently sweeping the country and is overwhelming some law enforcement, educators, safety officials and parents,&#8221; Galloway wrote a year ago. &#8220;This &#8216;new&#8217; marijuana is completely different than anything we have dealt with in the past.&#8221; </p>

        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>The medical marijuana market is in a downward spiral as businesses, lured by big money, shift to recreational </p>
<p>At the height of the medical marijuana industry there were 420 dispensaries in Oregon. Now there are only eight.  </p>
<p>In 2015, Erich Berkovitz opened his medical marijuana processing company, PharmEx, with the intention of getting sick people their medicine. His passion stemmed from his own illness. Berkovitz has Tourette syndrome, which triggers ticks in his shoulder that causes chronic pain. Cannabis takes that away. </p>
<p>Yet in the rapidly changing marijuana landscape, PharmEx is now one of three medical-only processors left in the entire state of Oregon. </p>
<p>On the retail end, it’s also grim. At the height of the medical marijuana industry in 2016, there were 420 dispensaries in Oregon available to medical cardholders. Today, only eight are left standing and only one of these medical dispensaries carries Berkovitz’s products. </p>
<p>Ironically, Oregon’s medical marijuana market has been on a downward spiral since the state legalized cannabis for recreational use in 2014. The option of making big money inspired many medical businesses to go recreational, dramatically shifting the focus away from patients to consumers. In 2015, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) took over the recreational industry. Between 2016 and 2018, nine bills were passed that expanded consumer access to marijuana while changing regulatory procedures on growing, processing and packaging. </p>
<p>In the shuffle, recreational marijuana turned into a million-dollar industry in Oregon, while the personalized patient-grower network of the medical program quietly dried up. </p>
<p>Now, sick people are suffering. </p>
<p>“For those patients that would need their medicine in an area that’s opted out of recreational sales, and they don’t have a grower or they’re not growing on their own, it does present a real access issue for those individuals,” said André Ourso, an administrator for the Center for Health Protection at the Oregon Health Authority. The woes of the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program (OMMP) were outlined in a recently published report by the Oregon Health Authority. The analysis found the program suffers from “insufficient and inaccurate reporting and tracking,” “inspections that did not keep pace with applications”, and “insufficient funding and staffing”.  </p>
<p>Operating outside of Salem, Oregon, PharmEx primarily makes extracts – a solid or liquid form of concentrated cannabinoids. Through his OMMP-licensed supply chain, he gets his high dose medicine to people who suffer from cancer, Crohn’s, HIV and other autoimmune diseases. Many are end-of-life patients. </p>
<p>These days, most recreational dispensaries sell both consumer and medical products, which are tax-free for cardholders. The problem for Berkovitz is that he’s only medically licensed. This means recreational dispensaries can’t carry his exacts. Legally, they can </p>
<p>only sell products from companies with an OLCC license. Since issuing almost 1,900 licenses, the OLCC has paused on accepting new applications until further notice. </p>
<p>Limits on THC – a powerful active ingredient in cannabis products – are also an issue, according to Berkovitz. With the dawn of recreational dispensaries, the Oregon Health Authority began regulating THC content. A medical edible, typically in the form of a sweet treat, is now capped at 100mg THC, which Berkovitz says is not enough for a really sick person. </p>
<p>“If you need two 3000mg a day orally and you’re capped at a 100mg candy bar, that means you need 20 candy bars, which cost $20 a pop,” he said. “So you’re spending $400 a day to eat 20 candy bars.” </p>
<p>“The dispensaries never worked for high dose patients, even in the medical program,” continued Berkovitz. “What worked was people who grew their own and were able to legally process it themselves,  or go to a processor who did it at a reasonable rate.” </p>
<p>But with increased processing and testing costs, and a decrease on the number of plants a medical grower can produce, patients are likely to seek cannabis products in a more shadowy place – the black market. </p>
<p>“All the people that we made these laws for – the ones who are desperately ill – are being screwed right now and are directed to the black market,” said Karla Kay, the chief of operations at PharmEx. </p>
<p>Kay, who also holds a medical marijuana card for her kidney disease, said some patients she knows have resorted to buying high dose medical marijuana products illegally from local farmers markets – in a state that was one of the first to legally establish a medical cannabis industry back in 1998. </p>
<p>Moreover, the networks between medical patients, growers and processors have diminished. </p>
<p>The OMMP maintains a record of processors and the few remaining dispensaries, but no published list of patients or grow sites – a privacy right protected under Oregon law, much to the chagrin of law enforcement. </p>
<p>According to the Oregon Health Authority’s report, just 58 of more than 20,000 medical growers were inspected last year. </p>
<p>In eastern Oregon’s Deschutes county, the sheriff’s office and the district attorney have repeatedly requested the location of each medical marijuana grower in their county. They’ve been consistently denied by the Oregon Health Authority. </p>
<p>Recently, the sheriff has gone as far as hiring a detective to focus solely on enforcing marijuana operations. </p>
<p>“There is an overproduction of marijuana in Oregon and the state doesn’t have adequate resources to enforce the laws when it comes to recreational marijuana, medical marijuana, as well as ensuring the growth of hemp is within the THC guidelines,” said the Deschutes sheriff, Shane Nelson. As of last February, the state database logged 1.1m pounds of cannabis flower, as reported by the Willamette Week in April. That’s three times what residents buy in a year, which means the excess is slipping out of the regulated market. To help curb the trend, senate bill 1544 was passed this year to funnel part of the state’s marijuana tax revenues into the Criminal Justice Commission and provide the funding needed to go after the black market, especially when it comes to illicit Oregon weed being smuggled to other states. The program’s priority is “placed on rural areas with lots of production and diversion, and little law enforcement”, said Rob Bovett, the legal counsel with the Association of Oregon Counties, who crafted the bill. </p>
<p>In a May 2018 memo on his marijuana enforcement priorities, Billy J Williams, a US attorney for the district of Oregon, noted that “since broader legalization took effect in 2015, large quantities of marijuana from Oregon have been seized in 30 states, most of which continue to prohibit marijuana.” </p>
<p>As of 1 July, however, all medical growers that produce plants for three or more patients – about 2,000 growers in Oregon – must track their marijuana from seed-to-sale using the OLCC’s Cannabis Tracking System. </p>
<p>Berkovitz, however, is looking to cut out the middle man (namely dispensaries) to keep PharmEx afloat. “The only way the patients are going to have large, high doses of medicine is if we revive the patient-grower networks. They need to communicate with each other. No one’s going to get rich, but everybody involved will get clean medicine from the people they trust at a more affordable rate.” </p>

<div class="first-block" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Teens who use e-cigarettes may be more likely to try marijuana in the future, especially if they start vaping at a younger age, a new study shows.</span></div>
<div class="article-banner first-banner" style="text-align: justify"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">More than 1 in 4 teenagers who reported <a class="textTag" style="color: #0000ff" href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/e-cigarette/" rel="tag">e-cigarette</a> use eventually progressed to smoking pot, according to the survey of more than 10,000 teens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">That compared with just 8 percent of non-vapers, said lead researcher Hongying Dai, senior biostatistician with Children&#8217;s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Further, teens who started vaping early had a greater risk of subsequent <a class="textTag" style="color: #0000ff" href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/marijuana/" rel="tag">marijuana</a> use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Kids aged 12 to 14 who used e-cigarettes were 2.7 times more likely to try marijuana than their peers, compared with a 1.6 times greater risk for teens who tried vaping between 15 and 17.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;Our findings suggest that the widespread use of e-cigarettes among youth may have implications for uptake of other drugs of abuse beyond nicotine and tobacco products,&#8221; Dai said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">For the study, Dai and her colleagues twice surveyed 10,364 kids aged 12 to 17—once in 2013-2014, and again a year later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The researchers found that teens who&#8217;d reported using e-cigarettes in the first wave were more likely to have tried marijuana for the first time during the subsequent year.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Results also showed that 12- to 14-year-olds who had tried e-cigs were 2.5 times more likely to become heavy marijuana users, smoking pot at least once a week.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Worse still, the researchers found that the more often <a class="textTag" style="color: #0000ff" href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/young+teens/" rel="tag">young teens</a> used e-cigarettes, the more likely they were to either try marijuana or become a heavy pot smoker.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Dai said the nicotine contained in e-cigarette vapor could be altering the brain chemistry of young teens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;The brain is still developing during the <a class="textTag" style="color: #0000ff" href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/teen/" rel="tag">teen</a> years; nicotine exposure might lead to changes in the central nervous system that predisposes teens to dependence on other drugs of abuse,&#8221; Dai said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It&#8217;s also possible that experimenting with e-cigarettes might increase a teen&#8217;s curiosity about marijuana, and reduce any worries about marijuana use, Dai added.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Additionally, kids who use e-cigarettes could be more likely to run with a crowd that tries other substances, said Dai and Dr. Scott Krakower, assistant unit chief of psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, N.Y.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;E-cigarettes are going to be in the same drug culture as other things,&#8221; Krakower said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">These findings should be concerning to parents because kids might not stop at trying marijuana, he said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;If you go to marijuana, is that going to lead to pills? Is that going to lead to something else?&#8221; Krakower said. &#8220;When we see progression to another substance, it&#8217;s like the &#8216;and then what&#8217; cascade—they went to marijuana, and then what?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Since this is a survey, it can&#8217;t prove a cause-and-effect relationship. And it&#8217;s possible that wild, risk-taking teens who try e-cigarettes are predisposed to be adventurous with other drugs, Dai and Krakower said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;It could be that they have more of that sensation-seeking personality, and if they pick up one they&#8217;re going to pick up the other,&#8221; Krakower said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But Dai said her team took that into account, and even after adjusting for sensation seeking, &#8220;ever e-cigarette use was still significantly associated with subsequent marijuana use.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Krakower recommends that parents look for warning signs of e-cigarette use—marked irritability, hiding things, skirting the truth—and put their foot down hard.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;There should be zero tolerance for this kind of behavior,&#8221; Krakower said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, agreed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;E-cigarettes are adult products and are not intended for youth of any age,&#8221; Conley said. &#8220;We agree with the authors&#8217; conclusion that more education is needed to help young people understand the consequences of using age-restricted products and illicit drugs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The new study was published online April 23 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">1) Stops Brain Waves and Thinking The brain has both stimulatory and inhibitory pathways.  GABA is the main brain inhibitory pathway. Brain centres talk to each other on gamma </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">(about 40 cycles/sec) and theta frequencies (about 5 cycles/sec), where the theta waves are  used as the carrier waves for the gamma wave which then interacts like harmonics in music. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The degree to which the waves are in and out of phase carries information which can be  monitored externally. GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) inhibition is key to the generation of the </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">synchronized firing which underpins these various brain oscillations. These GABA transmissions are controlled presynaptically by type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R’s) and </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">CB1R stimulation shuts them down. This is why cannabis users forget and fall asleep. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">2) Blocks GABA Pathway and Brain Formation GABA is also a key neurotransmitter in  brain formation in that it guides and direct neural stem cell formation and transmission and </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">development and growth of the cerebral cortex and other major brain areas. Gamma and theta  brain waves also direct neural stem cell formation, sculpting and connectivity. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Derangements </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">then of GABA physiology imply that the brain will not form properly. Thin frontal cortical  plate measurements have been shown in humans prenatally exposed to cannabis by fMRI. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">This implies that their brains can never be structurally normal which then explains the long  lasting and persistent defects identified into adulthood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">3) Epigenetic Damage DNA not only carries the genetic hardware of our genetic code but it also carries the software of the code which works like traffic lights along the sequence of DNA bases to direct when to switch the genes on and off. This is known as the “epigenetic code”. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Fetal alcohol syndrome is believed to be due to damage to the software epigenetic code. The long lasting intellectual, mood regulation, attention and concentration defects </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">which have been described after in utero cannabis exposure in the primary, middle and high schools and as college age young adults are likely due to these defects. Epigenetics “sets in stone” the errors of brain structure made in (2) above.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">4) Arterial Damage. Cannabis has a well described effect to damage arteries through (CB1R’s) (American Heart Association 2007) which they carry in high concentration (Nature Reviews Cardiology 2018). In adults this causes heart attack (500% elevation in the first hour after smoking), stroke, severe cardiac arrhythmias including sudden cardiac death; but in developing babies CB1R’s acting on the developing heart tissues can lead to at least six major cardiac defects (Atrial- ventricular- and mixed atrio-ventricular and septal defects, Tetralogy of Fallot, Epstein’s deformity amongst others), whilst constriction of various babies’ arteries can lead to serious side effects such as gastroschisis (bowels hanging out) and possibly absent limbs (in at least one series).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">5) Disruption of Mitotic Spindle. When cells divide the separating chromosomes actually slide along “train tracks” which are long chains made of tubulin. The tubulin chains are called “microtubules” and the whole football-shaped structure is called a “mitotic spindle”. Cannabis inhibits tubulin formation, disrupting microtubules and the mitotic spindle causing the separating chromosomes to become cut off in tiny micronuclei, where they eventually become smashed up and pulverized into “genetic junk”, which leads to foetal malformations, cancer and cell death. High rates of Down’s syndrome, chromosomal anomalies and cancers </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">in cannabis exposed babies provide clinical evidence of this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">6) Defective Energy Generation &amp; Downstream DNA Damage DNA is the crown jewel of the cell and its most complex molecule. Maintaining it in good repair is a very energy intensive process. Without energy DNA cannot be properly maintained. Cannabis has been known to reduce cellular energy production by the cell’s power plants, mitochondria, for many decades now. This has now been firmly linked with increased DNA damage, cancer formation and aging of the cells and indeed the whole organism. As it is known to occur in eggs and sperm, this will also damage the quality of the germ cells which go into forming the baby and lead directly to damaged babies and babies lost and wasted through spontaneous </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">miscarriage and therapeutic termination for severe deformities. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">7) Cancer induction Cannabis causes 12 cancers and has been identified as a carcinogen by the California Environmental Protection agency (2009). This makes it also a mutagen. 4 of these </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">cancers are inheritable to children; i.e. inheritable carcinogenicity and mutagenicity. All four studies in testicular cancer are strongly positive (elevation by three fold). Carcinogen = mutagen = teratogen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">8) Colorado’s Teratology Profile. From the above described teratological profile we would expect exactly the profile of congenital defects which have been identified in Colorado (higher total defects and heart defects, and chromosomal defects) and Ottawa in Canada (long lasting and persistent brain damage seen on both functional testing and fMRI brain scans in children exposed in utero) where cannabis use has become common. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Gastroschisis was shown to be higher in all seven studies looking at this; and including in Canada, carefully controlled studies. Moreover in Australia, Canada, North Carolina, Colorado, Mexico and New Zealand, gastroschisis and sometimes other major congenital defects cluster where </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">cannabis use is highest. Colorado 2000-2013 has experienced an extra 20,152 severely abnormal births above the rates prior to cannabis liberalization which if applied to the whole USA would equate to more than 83,000 abnormal babies live born annually (and probably about that number again therapeutically aborted); actually much more since both the number of users and concentration of cannabis have risen sharply since 2013, and cannabis has been well proven to be much more severely genotoxic at higher doses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">9) Cannabidiol is also Genotoxic and tests positive in many genotoxicity assays, just as tetrahydrocannabinol does.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">10) Births defects registry data needs to be open and transparent and public. At present it is not. This looks too much like a cover up.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">As of yesterday, it’s now legal for adults in California to purchase recreational marijuana. This is being hailed as a breakthrough against marijuana prohibition, but the masses of would-be pot smokers in California seem to carry a popular delusion that rests on the false idea that marijuana is <em>safe</em> to smoke in unlimited quantities because it’s “natural.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">As much as I disdain prohibition against any medicinal plant — and I’m convinced the “War on Drugs” was a miserable failure — I have news for all those who smoke pot: <strong>Smoking anything is a health risk</strong> because you’re inhaling a toxic stew of carcinogens produced in the smoke itself. Whether you’re smoking pot or tobacco, you’re still poisoning yourself with the very kind of carcinogens that promote lung cancer, heart disease, accelerated aging and cognitive decline.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Just because cannabis is now <em>legal</em> to smoke in California doesn’t mean it’s a wise habit to embrace. (There’s also a much better way to consume cannabis: Liquid form for oral consumption, as explained below…)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">California, which increasingly seems to be operating in a delusional fairy tale bubble on every issue from immigration to transgenderism, believes the legalization of recreational marijuana is a breakthrough worth celebrating. “The dispensary staff cheered as hundreds stood in line outside the club, waiting to shop and celebrate,” <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/New-era-to-open-in-California-with-first-sales-of-12464823.php">reports SF Gate</a>. “At some shops, the coming-out party was expected to feature live music, coffee and doughnuts, prizes for those first in line and speeches from supportive local politicians…”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Because, y’know, in a state that’s being overrun by illegal aliens, the junk science of “infinite genders” and university mobs of climate change cultists, what’s really needed is a whole new wave of <strong>lung cancer victims</strong> to add even more burden to the state’s health care costs. Genius! Gov. Brown should run for President or something…</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Inhale some more pesticides and see how “natural” you feel</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Sadly, many pro-cannabis consumers in California have convinced themselves that Big Tobacco is evil, but smoking pot is safe and natural… even “green.” Yet the cold hard truth of the matter it that marijuana in California is often produced with a toxic cocktail of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides. Yep, the very same people who buy “organic” at the grocery store are now smoking and inhaling cancer-causing weed grown with conventional pesticides. These are the same people who are concerned about 1 ppb of glyphosate in their Cheerios while simultaneously smoking 1,000 ppb of Atrazine in their weed. But science be damned, there’s a bong and a gas mask handy. Smoke up!</span></p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">California pot has already been scientifically proven to be shockingly contaminated. A whopping “…93 percent of samples collected by KNBC-TV from 15 dispensaries in four Southern California counties tested positive for pesticides,” reports the <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5188665/Burners-beware-California-pot-sold-Jan-1-tainted.html">UK Daily Mail</a>, which also reports:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>That may come as a surprise for consumers who tend to trust what’s on store shelves because of federal regulations by the US Agriculture Department or the US Food and Drug Administration. ‘Unfortunately, that’s not true of cannabis,’ Land said. ‘They wrongly assume it’s been tested for safety.’</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">I suppose all the science in the world is irrelevant when you have a mob of people who just want to get high. These are the same people who will March Against Monsanto, but they won’t even buy pesticide-free weed that they’re <em>inhaling.</em></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Edible cannabis products often contain toxic solvents, too</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It’s not just the pesticides in weed that are a major concern: Edible pot products also frequently contain traces of toxic solvents such as hexane. Because of the shocking lack of regulation of cannabis product production in places like Colorado, many small-scale producers are using insanely dangerous solvents to extract CBD, THC and other molecules from raw cannabis plants. Those solvents include:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Hexane (a highly explosive solvent also used by the soy industry to extract soy protein)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">IPA (isopropyl alcohol, which causes permanent nerve damage if you drink it)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Gasoline (also used to extract heroin in Third World countries)</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Anyone who thinks consuming these solvents is somehow “healthy” may have already suffered extensive brain damage from consuming those solvents. Yet edible cannabis products are almost universally looked upon as health-enhancing products, often with no thought given whatsoever to the pesticides, solvents or other toxins they may contain. (Some shops do conduct lab testing of their products, so if you’re going to consume these products, make sure you get lab-tested cannabis products.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In essence, the very same state where “progressives” have now come to believe there are an infinite number of genders — and that global warming causes extremely cold weather — have now embraced a delusional fairy tale about the imagined safety of consuming cannabis. All the news about the health benefits of cannabis only seems to have made the delusion worse: Some people now perceive smoking weed as a form of nutritional supplementation. They’ve even made it part of their holistic lifestyles, in a twisted kind of way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But what California has actually unleashed with all this is a whole new wave of:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Heart disease</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Lung cancer</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Cognitive decline</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Accelerated aging</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Increased health care costs state-wide</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Check with your friends in California and you’ll find that <strong>they have little to no awareness of the devastating health consequences of long-term pot smoking</strong>. It’s not going to turn you into a raging lunatic as depicted in <em>Refer Madness</em>, but it is going to expose your lungs, bloodstream and brain to a shockingly toxic stew of cell-damaging carcinogens. That gives pot smoke many of the same health risks as cigarette smoke.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">So what’s the right answer on all this? If you want to stay healthy, stop smoking cannabis. Take it in liquid form instead.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The safer option: Liquid cannabis extracts</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Liquid cannabis extracts are not only far safer to consume (because they don’t contain toxic carcinogens found in smoke); they also contain a far more diverse composition of cannabinoids.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">CBD-A, for example, the carboxylic acid form of cannabidiol, is destroyed by heat. This means that when you smoke cannabis, you’re not getting any CBD-A, even if it’s naturally present in the plant. The heat of the incineration destroys it before you inhale.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The same is true with THC-A and other carboxylic acid forms of cannabinoids. In fact, cannabis extracts that are heated to destroy those components are called “decarboxylated” or just “de-carbed” for short. Lighting up a joint and burning the cannabis as you inhale actually destroys many of the more medicinal components of cannabis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Taking cannabis extracts orally, on the other hand, gives you the full complement of all the cannabinoids, terpenes and other constituents… without the health risks associated with inhaling smoke.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The cannabis extract brand that we test and certify in our lab to meet or exceed label claims is called <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://nativehempsolutions.com/">Native Hemp Solutions</a>. It’s a whole-plant extract that maintains the natural cannabinoids and other constituents found in the living plant. Because it’s not an isolate, its molecules work synergistically to provide a more profound effect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Liquid forms of cannabis are vastly superior to cannabis smoke</strong> in terms of their synergistic phytonutrients (chemical constituents). While smoking marijuana provides a more rapid assimilation of THC into your bloodstream, the oral form of cannabis extracts actually provide a vastly more diverse array of nutrients, many of which are being studied for therapeutic use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">That’s why I don’t smoke cannabis. In fact, the only cannabis I consume is high-CBD, near-zero-THC liquid forms. That’s because I don’t want to give myself lung cancer or heart disease as a side effect of consuming a cannabis product.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Smoking pot isn’t harmless: Think rationally about the way to ingest cannabis molecules</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The bottom line here is that I want to encourage you to think carefully about the vectors through which you introduce cannabis molecules into your body. Smoking pot is rapid but carries long-term health risks due to carcinogenic smoke that you’re inhaling. I’m thrilled that California finally decriminalized this healing plant, but the fanfare surrounding the change in the law almost seems to be a celebration of <em>smoking</em>, which is a truly hazardous habit no matter what you’re smoking.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Oral forms are vastly superior in terms of ingesting the full array of nutrients, and some people on the extreme end of the spectrum actually use <strong>cannabis suppositories</strong> for a rapid effect that doesn’t involve damaging the lungs. Personally, I’m happy with taking CBD oils as a dietary supplement for the simple reason that I don’t ingest cannabis to get high; I ingest it for its health supporting effects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Now, let us hope Jeff Sessions and the feds can finally get around to ending marijuana prohibition, too. It’s time to end the senseless war on this promising natural herb, but we must also think carefully about the ways we ingest it.</span></p>

</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph speakable" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A total of 94 people &#8212; 89 in Illinois, two in Indiana and one each in Maryland, Missouri and Wisconsin &#8212; were seen in emergency departments with heavy bleeding between March 10 and April 5, according to the CDC <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USCDC/bulletins/1e6dac3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outbreak alert</a>.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph speakable" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Both of the fatalities occurred in Illinois.

<div class="zn-body__paragraph" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Synthetic cannabinoids are mind-altering chemicals that are made in a lab and sold either sprayed on shredded plant material so it can be smoked like marijuana or as liquid that can be vaporized in e-cigarettes. &#8220;Fake weed&#8221; products are marketed in shiny packages with hundreds of <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/synthetic-cannabinoids-k2spice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand names</a>, including Spice, K2, Joker, Black Mamba, Kush and Kronic.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">At least three product samples in the latest outbreak tested positive for brodifacoum &#8212; rat poison &#8212; and further laboratory tests confirmed this exposure in at least 18 of the Illinois patients.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__read-all" style="text-align: justify">
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;A working hypothesis is the synthetic cannabinoids were contaminated with brodifacoum,&#8221; according to the CDC.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">
<h3><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8216;Huge number of toxic effects&#8217;</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;This is the first time bleeding has ever been associated with synthetic cannabinioids,&#8221; said Professor <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170202123031.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul L. Prather</a> of the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Arkansas&#8217; College of Medicine, who was not involved in the CDC report. &#8220;It is certainly possible that the bleeding issues &#8230; might be due to products laced with the rat poison brodifacoum.&#8221;</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">However, he suggests that these adverse effects might be caused by an as-yet-unidentified synthetic cannabinoid chemical.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Specifically, this newest synthetic cannabinoid chemical could be derived from coumarin, a special class of chemical compounds, he believes.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A latecomer among synthetic cannabinoids, coumarin derivatives were first identified in a <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22916707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2012 Journal of Medicinal Chemistry paper</a>. This class of chemicals activates the cannabinoid receptors inthe brain while acting as anticoagulants or blood thinners. Warfarin and phenprocoumon, blood clot-preventing drugs prescribed to heart patients to protect them from getting heart attacks, are coumarin derivatives.</span></div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Although bleeding, seen for the first time in Illinois, is a &#8220;whole other can of worms,&#8221; Prather said, &#8220;there&#8217;s a huge number of toxic effects of synthetic cannabinoids.&#8221;</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;They produce a lot of neurological side effects. Seizures actually bring people into emergency departments a lot of the time,&#8221; he said. Other important neurological side effects include psychosis, panic attacks, agitation, confusion and catatonia.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;Young patients will come in with acute renal or kidney failure,&#8221; he said. There are also troubling effects on the heart (chest pain and hypertension) and, recently, gastrointestinal problems and hyperemesis syndrome: an extreme amount of vomiting.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">So why all the side effects?</span></div>

<h3><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8216;Guinea pigs&#8217;</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;What happens with the synthetic cannabinoid clandestine laboratories is, they&#8217;re very smart people, and they look at these papers and they go, &#8216;Oh, this compound has been developed, and it binds to these [cannabinoid] receptors, so if I produce this in my lab, I can probably sell this, because when people take it, it will probably produce euphoria like marijuana does,&#8217; &#8221; Prather explained.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Yet, he said, the compounds the clandestine scientists create &#8212; even when the formulas come from a published scientific paper &#8212; are &#8220;totally unknown chemicals.&#8221; Plus, there&#8217;s a lack of quality control.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;These drugs are made in a clandestine lab. Who knows what kind of contaminants are in this laboratory, and who knows from batch to batch how much of the chemical is actually made&#8221; &#8212; or the concentration of each chemical made, Prather added. One synthetic weed product might be four specific chemicals of a weak concentration, but the next time you buy the same product, it might be five chemicals of high concentration.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;If you&#8217;ve ever been to a drug company, they have the most rigid quality control you can imagine,&#8221; Prather said. Plus, there&#8217;s a lot of testing to ensure safety. &#8220;Believe me, in the drug industry, you kill a lot of rats and you kill a lot of mice before you get to the point of that final drug.&#8221;</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Drug users are &#8220;the guinea pigs and the rats and the mice for the development of these compounds,&#8221; Prather said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really kind of crazy.&#8221;</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">At the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Dr. Ruben Baler, a health scientist administrator, is getting the word out about the dangers of <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/synthetic-cannabinoids-k2spice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">synthetic cannabinoids</a> by speaking at conferences, giving lectures across the nation and talking with reporters.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">He believes that &#8220;the perception of harm is going up and usage is going down, at least among teenagers.&#8221;</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In fact, American Association of Poison Control Centers data indicates a decreasing number of <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://aapcc.s3.amazonaws.com/files/library/Syn_Marijuana_Web_Data_through_3.31.18_29zMok7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exposures to synthetic cannabinoids</a> reported between 2011 and 2017. Poison control centers across the country received 6,968 calls about these drugs in 2011, compared with 1,952 in 2017. As of March 31, there have been 462 reports this year.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;I don&#8217;t see an explosion of use among young people,&#8221; Baler said. Mostly, those who gravitate toward synthetic cannabinoids are &#8220;marginalized people,&#8221; including the homeless and those affected by mental illness, he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s where you see the deaths so far.&#8221;</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Enforcement of the law is not the role played by the National Institute on Drug Abuse; that role is played by the Drug Enforcement Administration, whose spokesman, Rusty Payne, says synthetic cannabinoids are designed for one reason only: &#8220;to get your credit card, get you high and addicted, and keep you coming back for more.&#8221;</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">
<h3><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Links to terrorism</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The DEA first encountered synthetic cannabinoids about 2006, Payne said.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In 2012, the US government passed the <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.dea.gov/pr/multimedia-library/publications/drug_of_abuse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act</a>, which classified a number of &#8220;designer drugs,&#8221; including synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic hallucinogens, under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act &#8212; meaning they have no accepted medical use and high potential for abuse.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Synthetic cannabinoids are made mainly in labs in China and mostly distributed online or at gas station convenience stores. &#8220;It used to be open shelf, but now this stuff is in the back,&#8221; Payne said.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;Ten-plus years of these problems,&#8221; he said. Despite the <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/nflis/spec_rpt_CathCan_2013.pdf#search=synthetic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">constantly changing chemical formulas</a>, synthetic cannabinoids are considered illegal. Still, &#8220;that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s easy to prosecute,&#8221; he said.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;Terrorists are increasingly turning to drug trafficking to finance their operations,&#8221; Payne, said, adding that the DEA has seen &#8220;significant amount of money transfers&#8221; into the Middle East of late, including Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and areas of unrest that are &#8220;financial system black holes.&#8221; Cash from synthetic cannabinoids, in particular, is flowing to these nations.</span></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Drug users who turn to synthetic cannabinoids are playing Russian roulette, Payne said. They are dangerous and even life-threatening, as the CDC reports. His thoughts are echoed by Baler and Prather, who added, &#8220;You hope you&#8217;re getting euphoria, but who knows what else you&#8217;re going to get?&#8221;</span></div>

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The revelation comes amid growing concerns that universities – and even some public schools – are awash with high-strength cannabis and other drugs.</span></p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The findings also back up academic research, revealed in The Mail on Sunday over the past three years, that skunk is having a serious detrimental impact on the mental health of the young. At least two studies have shown repeated use triples the risk of psychosis, with sufferers repeatedly experiencing delusional thoughts. Some victims end up taking their own lives.</span></p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Last night, Lord Nicholas Monson, whose 21-year-old son Rupert Green killed himself last year after becoming hooked on high-strength cannabis, said: ‘These figures show the extent of the damage that high-potency cannabis wreaks on the young.</span></p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">‘The big danger for young people – particularly teens – is that their brains can be really messed up by this stuff because they are still developing biologically. If they develop drug-induced psychosis – as Rupert did – the illness can stick for life.’</span></p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The large rise in the number of youngsters treated for cannabis abuse comes despite the fact that total usage is falling slightly.</span></p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The report concludes: ‘While fewer people are using cannabis, those who are using it are experiencing greater harm.’</span></p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Almost all cannabis on Britain’s streets is skunk, which is four times more powerful than types that dominated the market until the early 2000s. It can even trigger hallucinations.</span></p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Lord Monson said: ‘We really need Ministers to get a grip and launch a major publicity campaign about the dangers.’ </span></p>

<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It is certainly no surprise that the pro-drug, cannabis promoting lobby, manifesting itself through The Greens, continue to employ tired mantras that:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">deny science,</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">ignore best health-care practice and</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">propagandize harms away, with promises of tax revenues!</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Here’s the first anomaly: the same lobbyists rail against alcohol harms and seek to limit the pervasive nature of this ‘legal’ drug – to the point of even stating; <em>‘If alcohol was bought to market for the first time today, it would be prohibited/banned!” </em>Yet in breathtaking cognitive dissonance they want to unleash cannabis into the same promotable arena that alcohol and tobacco occupy – legal entitlement!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The second anomaly is: the tobacco fiasco – millions of dollars where spent on keeping/promoting cigarettes as not only legal and socially acceptable, but even <em>healthy for you</em>. Billions has been spent over the last 50 years dealing with the health outcomes of this drug – and then Billions more spent on driving this legal drug into the pariah space that is pseudo-prohibition!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>Make no mistake, the cannabis industry and those promoting its regulation is just Big Tobacco all over again, but with new and greater levels of pernicious harms.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The active push to normalise and legitimise Cannabis for ‘recreational’ use has been in play since late 70’s with Richard Cowen, a former Director of NORML (National Organisation for Reform of Marijuana Laws), going on public record (speaking at 1993 conference celebrating the 50 year anniversary of the discovery of LSD) stating <em>“The key to it </em>[legalizing marijuana for recreational use]<em> is to have 100’s of thousands of people using it ‘medically’ under medical supervision, the whole scam is going to be blown. Once there is medical access and we do what we continually have to do, and we will, then we will get full legalisation!”</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The latest National Drug Strategy 2017-26, now puts Demand Reduction as the <em><u>priority</u></em>!</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The strategy states that<em> “Harm Minimisation includes a range of approaches to help prevent and reduce drug related problems…including a <u>focus on abstinence-oriented</u> <u>strategies</u>&#8230;</em> [Harm minimisation] <em>policy approach does not condone drug use.” </em><sup>(page 6) </sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><sup><em>“</em></sup><em><u>Prevention of uptake reduces personal, family and community harms, allow better use of health and law enforcement resources, generates substantial social and economic benefits and produces a healthier workforce.</u></em><em> Demand Reduction strategies that prevent drug use are more cost effective than treating established drug-related problems…<u>Strategies that delay the onset of use prevent longer term harms and costs to the community</u>.” </em><sup>(page 8)</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">We need to be reducing demand for cannabis, not increasing it through the undermining of both demand and supply reduction pillars in our National Drug Strategy!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Is the de-facto legalisation and ‘regulation’ of cannabis going to reduce demand, supply and harm, or will it promote/permit the same and to an even wider cohort?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">If we have a regulated market for <em>recreational Cannabis</em>, will the already law-breaking and recalcitrant users suddenly line up to pay for, a now taxed product? We have seen the ‘black’ or ‘grey’ market on decriminalised prostitution continue alongside the now regulated industry for the simple reason that people do not want to <em>pay more</em> or be <em>regulated</em> as we are now seeing in the US State of Colorado!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Let us cut through the propagandised mantras about the so called ‘benign nature’ of this plant that buries evidence-based data with emotionalism and ‘big dollar’ revenue rhetoric.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">How easy has it been in the past for legislators to present such incredibly irresponsible policy measures to unleash (via government approval) the use of Cannabis as a ‘recreational’ substance. It’s time to put your money where your mouth is.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">We propose that those sponsoring/voting for such a change to our laws need to be held fiscally accountable for the costs of the harms done by their policies. As architects of a dangerous harm creating social experiment, who believe it to be in best interest of the entire community to, legalize, decriminalise, regulate or otherwise promote access/ entitlement to this drug, will then be fiscally accountable for the significant and broad ranging harms that will be incurred by our society as a result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Any legislation passing that enables further entitlement to cannabis/marijuana should include the names and political parties who sponsor these drug use liberalisation groups. The legislation must include that all costs of harms for said legislation must pay for the negative outcomes – all health, social and welfare costs incurred.  The monitoring and measuring of all aforementioned harms due to the liberalization of cannabis will be tallied and annual invoices to levied to Political Parties and individuals promoting such measures, for their remittance. If such accountabilities were in place, proponents would definitely think twice before being so outrageous in their claim.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It’s time to get serious about the drug issue as we did with the Tobacco scourge. The War on Tobacco was long, but effective. It’s time we had a serious campaign <em>(for the first time in 30 years)</em> on illicit drugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">We need, as with the <em>QUIT Tobacco Campaign</em>, <strong>One Focus – Once Message – One Voice</strong> in every key sector in the culture; Government – Education – Media – Policing – Community!</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">So, who is driving drug policy now – Drug users, or law abiding, best health practice and responsible citizens?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It’s time our legislators and policy makers cared more for the clear majority of families, children and the community who do not <em>use</em>, or want drug use in their community. Legislators risk looking as though they have succumbed to the highly manipulative, drug-affected minority to further harm the community. These manipulators attempt to assail the law, assault families and damage public health all with the cleverly crafted, weaponised activities of the local ‘pot-head’ or desperado, currently being given too much ‘oxygen’ in the public domain.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In 2017, there were 378 total marijuana exposures reported to the Washington State Poison Center. This number is an all-time high for reported marijuana exposures and is an increase of 87 incidents from the previous year.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/pic2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-14839" src="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/pic2.png" alt="" width="710" height="388" srcset="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/pic2.png 710w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/pic2-300x164.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Almost a third of the reported instances of marijuana exposure in the last year occur within the age group of children up to 5 years old. <strong>The rate of exposure among this age group has seen an explosive increase of almost 58% compared to the previous year</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Of the reported 378 instances of marijuana exposure in 2017, nearly half occurred as a result of eating marijuana edibles. Following legalization and commercialization, the marijuana industry has flooded the market with high-potency THC infused cookies, gummies, sodas, and other edibles that are highly appealing children.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/pic3.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-14840" src="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/pic3.png" alt="" width="638" height="454" srcset="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/pic3.png 638w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/pic3-300x213.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></a></span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Of note: the reporting of exposures to the Poison Center is completely voluntary and is most likely an underrepresentation to the true amounts of marijuana exposure occurring in the state of Washington.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;This report is extremely troubling,&#8221; said Dr. Kevin Sabet, president and founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM). &#8220;As Big Marijuana continues to churn out kid-friendly edibles, more and more young children are ending up in emergency rooms. The preponderance of data show that marijuana has a damaging effect on developing brains but reports such as this get swept under the rug as lawmakers rush to liberalize drug laws.&#8221;</span></p>

The findings come as campaigns to decriminalize marijuana gain traction with voters and legislators in the U.S., and Canada begins allowing recreational use of marijuana this month.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older with voter approval in November 2012. Retail sales began in January 2014 in Colorado and in July 2014 in Washington. Oregon voters approved legalized recreational marijuana in November 2014, and sales started in October 2015. Nevada voters approved recreational marijuana in November 2016, and retail sales began in July 2017.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">HLDI analysts estimate that the frequency of collision claims per insured vehicle year rose a combined 6 percent following the start of retail sales of recreational marijuana in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, compared with the control states of Idaho, Montana, Utah and Wyoming. The combined-state analysis is based on collision loss data from January 2012 through October 2017.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Analysts controlled for differences in the rated driver population, insured vehicle fleet, the mix of urban versus rural exposure, unemployment, weather and seasonality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Collision claims are the most frequent kind of claims insurers receive. Collision coverage insures against physical damage to a driver&#8217;s vehicle in a crash with an object or other vehicle, generally when the driver is at fault. Claim frequencies are expressed as the number of claims per 100 insured vehicle years. An insured vehicle year is one vehicle insured for one year or two vehicles insured for six months each.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A separate IIHS study examined 2012–16 police-reported crashes before and after retail sales began in Colorado, Oregon and Washington. IIHS estimates that the three states combined saw a 5.2 percent increase in the rate of crashes per million vehicle registrations, compared with neighboring states that didn&#8217;t legalize marijuana sales.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">IIHS researchers compared the change in crash rate in Colorado,Oregon and Washington with the change in crash rates in the neighboring states that didn&#8217;t enact recreational marijuana laws. Researchers compared Colorado with Nebraska, Wyoming and Utah, and they compared Oregonand Washington with Idaho and Montana. The study controlled for differences in demographics, unemployment and weather in each state.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The size of the effect varied by state. Although the study controlled for several differences among the states, the models can&#8217;t capture every single difference. For example, marijuana laws in Colorado, Oregon and Washington differ in terms of daily purchase limits, sales taxes and available options for home growers. These differences can influence how often consumers buy marijuana, where they buy it and where they consume it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The 5.2 percent increase in police-reported crash rates following legalization of recreational marijuana use is consistent with the 6 percent increase in insurance claim rates estimated by HLDI.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;The new IIHS-HLDI research on marijuana and crashes indicates that legalizing marijuana for all uses is having a negative impact on the safety of our roads,&#8221; says IIHS-HLDI President David Harkey. &#8220;States exploring legalizing marijuana should consider this effect on highway safety.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Marijuana is still an illegal controlled substance under federal law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In addition to the study states, Alaska, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont and the District of Columbia also allow recreational use of marijuana for adults 21 and older and medical use of marijuana. Another 22 states allow medical marijuana, while 15 more states permit the use of specific cannabis products for designated medical conditions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Legalization of recreational use is pending in New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. In November, Michigan and North Dakota will hold referendums on marijuana, and Missouri and Utah voters will decide whether to expand medical marijuana laws in their states.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Driving under the influence of marijuana is illegal in all 50 states and D.C., but determining impairment is challenging. Unlike alcohol, the amount of marijuana present in a person&#8217;s body doesn&#8217;t consistently relate to impairment. THC, or Tetrahydrocannabinol, is the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. A positive test for THC and its active metabolite doesn&#8217;t mean the driver was impaired at the time of the crash. Habitual users of marijuana may have positive blood tests for THC days or weeks after using the drug.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Marijuana&#8217;s role in crashes isn&#8217;t as clear as the link between alcohol and crashes. Many states don&#8217;t include consistent information on driver drug use in crash reports, and policies and procedures for drug testing are inconsistent. More drivers in crashes are tested for alcohol than for drugs. When drivers are tested, other drugs are often found in combination with alcohol, which makes it difficult to isolate their separate effects.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;Despite the difficulty of isolating the specific effects of marijuana impairment on crash risk, the evidence is growing that legalizing its use increases crashes,&#8221; Harkey says.</span></p>

		<p>Sydney Parliament House, 09.07.2018 </p>
<p>Cannabis has been greatly oversold by a left leaning press controlled by globalist and  centralist forces while its real and known dangers have not been given appropriate weight in  the popular press.  In particular its genotoxic and teratogenic potential on an unborn  generation for the next hundred years has not been aired or properly weighed in popular forums.  </p>
<p>These weighty considerations clearly take cannabis out of the realm of personal choice or individual freedoms and place it squarely in the realm of the public good and a matter with which the whole community is rightly concerned and properly involved. </p>
<p>Cannabinoids are a group of 400 substances which occur only in the leaves of the Cannabis sativa plant where they are used by the plants as toxins and poisons in natural defence against other plants and against herbivores.  </p>
<p>Major leading world experts such as Dr Nora Volkow, Director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse at NIH 1, Professor Wayne Hall, Previous Director of the Sydney Based National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at UNSW 2, and Health Canada 3 – amongst many others &#8211; are agreed that cannabis is linked with the following impressive lists of toxicities: </p>
<p>1) Cannabis is addictive, particularly when used by teenagers </p>
<p>2) Cannabis affects brain development </p>
<p>3) Cannabis is a gateway to other harder drug use </p>
<p>4) Cannabis is linked with many mental health disorders including anxiety, depression,  </p>
<p>psychosis, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder </p>
<p>5) Cannabis alters and greatly impairs the normal developmental trajectory – getting a  </p>
<p>job, finishing a course and forming a long term stable relationship 4-11 </p>
<p>6) Cannabis impairs driving ability 12 </p>
<p>7) Cannabis damages the lungs </p>
<p>8) Cannabis is immunosuppressive </p>
<p>9) Cannabis is linked with heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular disease </p>
<p>10) Cannabis is commonly more potent in recent years, with forms up to 30% being widely available in many parts of USA, and oils up to 100% THC also widely available. </p>
<p>Serious questions have also been raised about its involvement in 12 different cancers, increased Emergency Room presentations and exposures of developing babies during pregnancy. It is with this latter group that the present address is mainly concerned. </p>
<p>Basic Physiology and Embryology Cells make energy in dedicated organelles called mitochondria. Mitochondrial energy, in the form of ATP, is known to be involved in both DNA protection and control of the immune system.  This means that when the cell’s ATP is high DNA maintenance is good and the genome is intact.  When cellular ATP drops DNA maintenance is impaired, DNA breaks remain unsealed, and cancers can form.  Also immunity is triggered by low ATP. </p>
<p>As organisms age ATP falls by half each 20 years after the age of 20.  Mitochondria signal and shuttle to the cell nucleus via several pathways.  Not only do cells carry cannabinoid receptors on their surface, but they also exist, along with their signalling machinery, at high density on mitochondria themselves 13-19.  Cannabis, and indeed all addictive drugs, are known to impair this cellular energy generation and thus promote the biochemical aging process 14-16,19,20. Most addictions are associated with increased cancers, increased infections and increased clinical signs of ageing 21-34. </p>
<p>The foetal heart forms very early inside the mother with a heartbeat present from day 21 of human gestation.  The heart forms by complicated pathways, and arises from more than six groups of cells inside the embryo 35,36.  First two arteries come together, they fold, then flex and twist to give the final shape of the adult heart.  Structures in the centre of the heart mass called endocardial cushions grow out to form the heart valves between the atria and ventricles and parts of the septum which grows between the two atria and ventricles. These cardiac cushions, and their associated conoventricular ridges which grow into and divide the cardiac outflow tract into left and right halves, all carry high density cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1R’s) and cannabis is known to be able to interfere with their growth and development.CB1R’s appear on foetal arteries from week nine of human gestation 37. </p>
<p>The developing brain grows out in a complex way in the head section 35,36.  Newborn brain cells are born centrally in the area adjacent to the central ventricles of the brain and then migrate along pathways into the remainder of the brain, and grow to populate the cortex, parietal lobes, olfactory lobes, limbic system, hypothalamus and hippocampus which is an important area deep in the centre of the temporal lobes where memories first form.   </p>
<p>Developing bipolar neuroblasts migrate along pathways and then climb out along 200 million guide cells, called radial glia cells, to the cortex of the brain where they sprout dendrites and a major central axon which are then wired in to the electrical network in a “use it or lose it”, “cells that fire together wire together” manner.  </p>
<p>The brain continues to grow and mature into the 20’s as new neurons are born and surplus dendrites are pruned by the immune system.  Cannabinoids interfere with cellular migration, cellular division, the generation of newborn neurons and all the classes of glia, axonal pathfinding, dendrite sprouting, myelin formation around axons and axon tracts and the firing of both inhibitory and stimulatory synapses 14-16,19,20,38-40.  Cannabinoids interfere with gene expression directly, via numerous epigenetic means, and via immune perturbation.  </p>
<p>Cannabinoids also disrupt the mechanics of cell division by disrupting the mitotic spindle on which chromosomal separation occurs, causing severe genetic damage and frank chromosomal mis-segregation, disruption, rupture and pulverization 41-43.   </p>
<p>Cannabis was found to be a human carcinogen by the California Environmental Protection agency in 2009 44.  This makes it a likely human teratogen (deforms babies).  Importantly, while discussion continues over some cancers, it bears repeating that a positive association between cannabis and testicular cancer was found in all four studies which investigated this question 45-49. </p>
<p>Cannabis Teratogenesis </p>
<p>The best animal models for human malformations are hamsters and rabbits.  In rabbits cannabis exhibits a severe spectrum of foetal abnormalities when applied at high dose including shortened limbs, bowels hanging out, spina bifida and exencephaly (brain hanging out). There is also impaired foetal growth and increased foetal loss and resorption 50,51.   </p>
<p>Many of these features have been noted in human studies 52.  In 2014 Centres for Disease Control Atlanta Georgia reported increased rates of anencephaly (no brain, usually rapid death) gastroschisis (bowels hanging out), diaphragmatic hernia, and oesophageal narrowing 53,54.  The American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics reported in 2007 an increased rate of ventricular septal defect and an abnormality of the tricuspid valve (Ebstein’s anomaly) 55. Strikingly, a number of studies have shown that cannabis exposure of the father is worse than that of the mother 56.  In Colorado atrial septal defect is noted to have risen by over 260% from 2000-2013 (see Figure 1; note close correlation (correlation coefficient R = 0.95, P value = 0.000066) between teenage cannabis use and rising rate of major congenital anomalies in Colorado to 12.7%, or 1 in 8 live births, a rate four times higher than the USA national average !) 57. </p>
<p>And three longitudinal studies following children exposed to cannabis in utero have consistently noted abnormalities of brain growth with smaller brains and heads – persisting into adult life &#8211; and deficits of cortical and executive functioning persistent throughout primary, middle and high schools and into young adult life in the early 20’s 58-63. An Australian MRI neuroimaging study noted 88% disconnection of cortical wiring from the splenium to precuneus which are key integrating and computing centres in the cerebral cortex 38,39,64.  Chromosomal defects were also found to be elevated in Colorado (rose 30%) 57, in Hawaii 52 in our recent analysis of cannabis use and congenital anomalies across USA, and in infants presenting from Northern New South Wales to Queensland hospitals 65. And gastroschisis shows a uniform pattern of elevation in all recent studies which have examined it (our univariate meta-analysis) 52,54,66-71.  </p>
<p>Interestingly the gastroschisis rate doubled in North Carolina in just three years 1997-2001 72, but rose 24 times in Mexico 73 which for a long time formed a principal supply source for Southern USA 74.  Within North Carolina gastroschisis and congenital heart defects closely followed cannabis distribution routes 74-76.  In Canada a remarkable geographical analysis by the Canadian Government has shown repeatedly that the highest incidence of all anomalies – including chromosomal anomalies &#8211; occurs in those northern parts where most cannabis is smoked 77,78. </p>
<p>Congenital anomalies forms the largest cause of death of babies in the first year of life.  The biggest group of them is cardiovascular defects.  Since cannabis affects several major classes<br />
of congenital defects it is obviously a major human teratogen.  Its heavy epigenetic footprint,<br />
by which it controls gene expression by controlling DNA methylation and histone modifications 79-81, imply that its effects will be felt for the next three to four generations – that is the next 100 years 82,83. Equally obviously it is presently being marketed globally as a major commodity apparently for commercial – or ideological &#8211; reasons. Since cannabis is clearly contraindicated in several groups of people including: </p>
<p>1) Babies </p>
<p>2) Children </p>
<p>3) Adolescents </p>
<p>4) Car drivers </p>
<p>5) Commercial Drivers &#8211; Taxis, Buses, Trains,  </p>
<p>6) Pilots of Aeroplanes </p>
<p>7) Workers – Manual Tools, Construction, Concentration Jobs </p>
<p>8) Children </p>
<p>9) Adolescents </p>
<p>10) Males of Reproductive age </p>
<p>11) Females of Reproductive age </p>
<p>12) Pregnancy </p>
<p>13) Lactation </p>
<p>14) Workers </p>
<p>15) Older People – Mental Illness </p>
<p>16) Immunosuppressed </p>
<p>17) Asthmatics – 80% Population after severe chest infection </p>
<p>18) People with Personal History of Cancer </p>
<p>19) People with Family History of Cancer </p>
<p>20) People with Personal History of Mental Illness </p>
<p>21) People with Family History of Mental Illness </p>
<p>22) Anyone or any population concerned about ageing effects 34 </p>
<p>… cannabis legalization is not likely to be in the best interests of public health.  </p>
<p>Concluding Remarks </p>
<p>In 1854 Dr John Snow achieved lasting public health fame by taking the handle off the Broad Street pump and saving east London from its cholera epidemic, based upon the maps he drew of where the cholera cases were occurring – in the local vicinity of the Broad Street pump.   </p>
<p>Looking across the broad spectrum of the above evidence one notices a trulyremarkable concordance of the evidence between: </p>
<p>1) Preclinical studies in  </p>
<p>i) Rabbits and </p>
<p>ii) Hamsters </p>
<p>2) Cellular and biological mechanisms, particularly relating to: </p>
<p>i) Brain development  </p>
<p>ii) Heart development </p>
<p>iii) Blood vessel development </p>
<p>iv) Genetic development </p>
<p>v) Abnormalities of chromosomal segregation </p>
<p>i. Downs syndrome </p>
<p>ii. Turners syndrome </p>
<p>iii. Trisomy 18 </p>
<p>iv. Trisomy 13 </p>
<p>vi) Cell division / mitotic poison / micronucleus formation </p>
<p>vii) Epigenetic change </p>
<p>viii) Growth inhibition </p>
<p>3) 84Cross-sectional Epidemiological studies, especially from: </p>
<p>i) Canada 77,85 </p>
<p>ii) USA 86,87 </p>
<p>iii) Northern New South Wales 65,88 4) Longitudinal studies from 58: </p>
<p>i) Ottawa 59-63 </p>
<p>ii) Pittsburgh </p>
<p>  iii) Netherlands </p>
<p>Our studies of congenital defects in USA have also shown a close concordance of congenital anomaly rates for 23 defects with the cannabis use rate indexed for the rising cannabis concentration in USA, and mostly in the three major classes of brain defects, cardiovascular defects and chromosomal defects, just as found by previous investigators in Hawaii 52.  </p>
<p>Of no other toxin to our knowledge can it be said that it interferes with brain growth and development to the point where the brain is permanently shrunken in size or does not form at all. The demonstration by CDC twice that the incidence of anencephaly (no brain) is doubled by cannabis 53,54 implies that anencephaly is the most severe end of the neurobehavioural teratogenicity of cannabis and forms one end of a continuum with all the other impairments which are implied by the above commentary. </p>
<p>(Actually when blighted ova, foetal resorptions and spontaneous abortion are included in the teratological profile anencephaly is not the most severe end of the teratological spectrum – that is foetal death).  It is our view that with the recent advent of high dose potent forms of cannabis reaching the foetus through both maternal and paternal lines major and clinically significant neurobehavioural teratological presentations will become commonplace, and might well become all but universal in infants experiencing significant gestational exposure. </p>
<p>One can only wonder if the community has been prepared for such a holocaust and tsunami amongst its children? </p>
<p>It is the view of myself and my collaborators that these matters are significant and salient and should be achieving greater airplay in the public discussion proceeding around the world at this time on this subject.   </p>
<p>Whilst cannabis legalization may line the pockets of the few it will clearly not be in the public interest in any sense; and indeed the public will be picking up the bill for this unpremeditated move for generations to come.  Oddly &#8211; financial gain seems to be one of the primary drivers of the present transnational push.  When the above described public health message gets out amongst ambitious legal fraternities, financial gain and the threat of major medico-legal settlements for congenital defects &#8211; will quickly become be the worst reason for cannabis legalization.   </p>
<p>Indeed it can be argued that the legalization lobby is well aware of all of the above concerns – and their controlled media pretend debate does not allow such issues to air in the public forum.  The awareness of these concerns is then the likely direct reason that cannabis requires its own legislation.  As noted in the patient information leaflet for the recently approved Epidiolex (cannabidiol oil for paediatric fits) the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is well aware of the genotoxicity of cannabinoids.   </p>
<p>The only possible conclusion therefore is that the public is deliberately being duped. To which our only defence will be to publicize the truth.   </p>

		<p>Tens of thousands of people are ending up in hospital with cannabis-related health problems, official figures have revealed. </p>
<p>There were 27,501 admissions linked to cannabis in England in 2016/17, a 15 per cent rise in just two years from 23,866 in 2014/15. </p>
<p>Labour MP Jeff Smith, who requested the figures on cannabis-related hospitalisations, said the large increase was ‘a concern’.  </p>
<p>The influential medical journal The Lancet has just taken the unprecedented step of branding cannabis a ‘huge risk to health’. </p>
<p>Mr Smith, an ex-DJ who has admitted taking drugs, said: ‘It could be that the rise in hospital admissions is associated with rises in particular types of cannabis being used – street cannabis now tends to be more “skunk”.’ </p>
<p> ‘Skunk’ has a high concentration of the main psychoactive compound THC, which is strongly linked to increased risk of psychosis. </p>
<p>A recent study based on drugs seized by police found that 94 per cent of cannabis now sold on UK streets is ‘skunk’. Academics say this super-strength cannabis could be behind the rise in mental health problems linked to the drug. </p>
<p>Now,The Lancet has warned in a hard-hitting editorial that with the ‘increasing liberalisation of laws’, users need to be made ‘aware of risks to their health and wellbeing. </p>
<p>The journal was reflecting on results from the 2018 Global Drug Survey, which asked 130,000 people in 44 nations about their use of drugs. The Lancet said: ‘Globally, cannabis is still the top illicit drug used and, with the concurrent use of tobacco, remains a huge health risk.’ </p>
<p>Its position is in marked contrast to 1995 when it stated: ‘The smoking of cannabis, even long-term, is not harmful to health.’ </p>
<p>Mr Smith claimed: ‘Legalisation and regulation is a better way of reducing harm than leaving the trade in the hands of criminals.’ </p>

		<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p><strong>Background</strong> </p>
<p>Interest in the use of cannabis and cannabinoids to treat chronic non-cancer pain is increasing, because of their potential to reduce opioid dose requirements. We aimed to investigate cannabis use in people living with chronic non-cancer pain who had been prescribed opioids, including their reasons for use and perceived effectiveness of cannabis; associations between amount of cannabis use and pain, mental health, and opioid use; the effect of cannabis use on pain severity and interference over time; and potential opioid-sparing effects of cannabis.  </p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong> </p>
<p> The Pain and Opioids IN Treatment study is a prospective, national, observational cohort of people with chronic non-cancer pain prescribed opioids. Participants were recruited through community pharmacies across Australia, completed baseline interviews, and were followed up with phone interviews or self-complete questionnaires yearly for 4 years. </p>
<p> Recruitment took place from August 13, 2012, to April 8, 2014. Participants were asked about lifetime and past year chronic pain conditions, duration of chronic non-cancer pain, pain self-efficacy, whether pain was neuropathic, lifetime and past 12-month cannabis use, number of days cannabis was used in the past month, and current depression and generalised anxiety disorder. We also estimated daily oral morphine equivalent doses of opioids. </p>
<p> We used logistic regression to investigate cross-sectional associations with frequency of cannabis use, and lagged mixed-effects models to examine temporal associations between cannabis use and outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>Findings</strong> </p>
<p>1514 participants completed the baseline interview and were included in the study from Aug 20, 2012, to April 14, 2014. Cannabis use was common, and by 4-year follow-up, 295 (24%) participants had used cannabis for pain. Interest in using cannabis for pain increased from 364 (33%) participants (at baseline) to 723 (60%) participants (at 4 years). At 4-year follow-up, compared with people with no cannabis use, we found that participants who used cannabis had a greater pain severity score (risk ratio 1·14, 95% CI 1·01–1·29, for less frequent cannabis use; and 1·17, 1·03–1·32, for daily or near-daily cannabis use), greater pain interference score (1·21, 1·09–1·35; and 1·14, 1·03–1·26), lower pain self-efficacy scores (0·97, 0·96–1·00; and 0·98, 0·96–1·00), and greater generalised anxiety disorder severity scores (1·07, 1·03–1·12; and 1·10, 1·06–1·15). </p>
<p>We found no evidence of a temporal relationship between cannabis use and pain severity or pain interference, and no evidence that cannabis use reduced prescribed opioid use or increased rates of opioid discontinuation. </p>
<p><strong> Interpretation  </strong></p>
<p>Cannabis use was common in people with chronic non-cancer pain who had been prescribed opioids, but we found no evidence that cannabis use improved patient outcomes. People who used cannabis had greater pain and lower self-efficacy in managing pain, and there was no evidence that cannabis use reduced pain severity or interference or exerted an opioid-sparing effect. As cannabis use for medicinal purposes increases globally, it is important that large well designed clinical trials, which include people with complex comorbidities, are conducted to determine the efficacy of cannabis for chronic non-cancer pain.

<p class="author-byline" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">By <span class="author">Alison George</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Cannabis is in the headlines for its potential medical benefits after the recent confiscation of <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2171983-time-to-end-the-cruel-ban-on-using-cannabis-therapy-for-epilepsy/">cannabis oil medication from the mother of a 12-year-old British boy with severe epilepsy</a>. The furore that ensued is shining a light on campaigns for cannabis oils to be made legal for medical reasons, and the UK government has now announced a review into the use of medicinal cannabis. Here’s what you need to know.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>What is cannabis oil?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Cannabis oil is extracted from the cannabis plant <em>Cannabis sativa</em>. The plants medicinal properties have been touted for more than 3,000 years. It was described in the ancient Eygyptian Ebers papyrus around 1550BC, and it was likely used as a medicine in China before that. Some varieties of the plant contain high levels of the psychoactive substance tetrahydrocannabinol (<a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130257-a-little-cannabis-every-day-might-keep-brain-ageing-at-bay/">THC</a>), which is responsible for the “high” that comes from smoking or eating cannabis leaves or resin. The plant’s other major chemical component is <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730354-500-e-spliff-on-sale-in-uk-designed-to-relieve-pain-minus-the-high/">cannabidiol</a>, which has no psychoactive effect. Both act on the body’s natural cannabinoid receptors which are involved in many processes such as memory, pain and appetite. The cannabis plant also contains more than 100 other different cannabinoid compounds at lower concentrations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>So can cannabis oil make you high?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It depends on the THC content. Some types of <em>Cannabis sativa</em> plant, known as hemp, contain very little THC. The extracts from these plants contain mainly cannabidiol, so will not get anyone stoned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Is it legal?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">That’s a complicated question. In the UK cannabidiol is legal. Cannabis plant extracts (known as hemp or CBD oils) are available in high-street stores but the THC content must be below 0.2 per cent. “THC is not psychoactive at this level,” says <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18099-david-nutt-governments-should-get-real-on-drugs/">David Nutt</a>, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Imperial College London. But cannabidiol is illegal in many other countries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In the USA for example, <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://eu.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2018/05/04/court-rules-cbd-cannabidiol-schedule-1-controlled-substance-marijuana-pot/580835002/">cannabidiol is classed as a schedule 1 controlled substance</a>, and can only be sold in states where cannabis use is legal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">However, the tide may turn in favour of cannabidiol after a recent <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://www.who.int/medicines/access/controlled-substances/5.2_CBD.pdf">World Health Organisation review</a>. This concluded that cannabidiol “exhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or dependence potential” but “has been demonstrated as an effective treatment of epilepsy … and may be a useful treatment for a number of other medical conditions.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>What is the evidence that cannabis oils can help treat epilepsy?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Although there is some scientific evidence <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604191/">that THC has potential to control convulsions</a>, its mind-altering effects mean that much of the focus has turned to cannabidiol – particularly for childhood epilepsies that conventional drugs fail to control.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Two recent high quality randomised and placebo controlled trials showed that cannabidiol is an <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)30136-3/fulltext">effective treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome</a> and <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5716495/">Dravet syndrome</a>, severe forms of epilepsy. The mechanism of action is unknown, but it may be <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.gwpharm.com/products-pipeline/research-trials/mechanism-action">due to a combination of effects</a>, such as inhibiting the activity of neurons and dampening inflammation in the brain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The situation is less clear when it comes to the use of commercial cannabis oils to control seizures, where the evidence is mainly anecdotal, and the oils can contain differing concentrations of cannabidiol and THC.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The UK government announced on 19 June that <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23831833-300-uk-government-to-review-medicinal-cannabis-laws/">it would review the use of medical cannabis</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Are there any cannabis-based epilepsy drugs on the market?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Not yet. In April the US Food and Drug Administration recommended the approval of a drug called Epidiolex for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. Its active ingredient is cannabidiol, and final approval is due at the end of this month.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">However, it is possible the drug is not as effective as cannabis oil containing THC, says Nutt. For example, the cannabis oil used to treat Billy Caldwell, the boy at the centre of the recent cannabis oil confiscation furore, contained cannabidiol and a low dose of THC, because cannabidiol alone did not stop all his seizures.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This is one of the big unknowns. “It is important to remember that there is currently very little scientific evidence to support cannabis oil containing both THC and cannabidiol as a treatment for epilepsy,” said the charity Epilepsy Action, in a <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/involved/campaigns/cannabis">statement issued this month</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Are cannabis-based medications available for other conditions?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Yes. A synthetic version of THC called Nabilone has been used since the 1980s to treat nausea after chemotherapy and to help people put on weight. A drug called Sativex is also <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20367-cannabis-based-drug-gets-green-light-worldwide/">approved for the treatment of pain</a> and spasms associated with multiple sclerosis. It contains an equal mix of THC and cannabidiol, but would not be suitable for the treatment of children with epilepsy such as Billy. “If you used that to treat epilepsy, the kids would be stoned off their heads,” says Nutt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>What is the aim of the UK government’s review of medical cannabis? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The first part of the review will look at the evidence for the therapeutic value of cannabis-based products. It can recommend any promising ones for the second part of the review. This will be carried out by the government’s Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs, which can recommend a change to the legal medical status of cannabis and cannabinoids.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This will hopefully lead to a relaxation of the rules surrounding research into cannabis-based medicines says Tom Freeman, a clinical psychopharmacologist at King’s College London.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In the UK cannabis currently has Schedule 1 status, the most restrictive category, which is for drugs which are not used medicinally such as LSD. “This creates a Catch 22 situation,” says Freeman. “You can’t show that cannabis and cannabis-based products have medicinal value because of restrictions on medical research.”  If cannabis is moved to the Schedule 2 category, it will join substances such as morphine and diamorphine (heroin) which can be prescribed by doctors if there is a clinical need. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Do FDA-approved psychostimulants increase the risk of cardiovascular events?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">There is no convincing evidence that FDA-approved psychostimulants (e.g. methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, amphetamine salts, and atomoxatine) increase the risk for cardiovascular events among patients without pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, among those with pre-existing heart disease, including arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, heart failure, or in patients for whom an increase in heart rate or blood pressure could be harmful, psychostimulants may increase the risk for cardiovascular events.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>How does cocaine end up as the number two cause of drug deaths, just behind opioids? Excluding adulteration with opioids, how does cocaine kill you?</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The effects of cocaine on the cardiovascular system can be grouped into acute and chronic processes. Cocaine use can cause one or more of several acute, life-threatening cardiovascular effects. The most common is myocardial ischemia or infarction (e.g. a heart attack). Cocaine can induce a heart attack through one of several mechanisms. First, cocaine causes arterial (including coronary artery) vasoconstriction, which can lead to coronary vasospasm. Second, cocaine activates platelets, which increases the risk of thrombosis (including coronary thrombosis). Third, cocaine use produces an adrenergic surge which induces tachycardia (high heart rate) and hypertension. High heart rate and hypertension both increase myocardial oxygen demand, which can cause supply-demand mismatch and precipitate myocardial ischemia or infarction. Fourth, vasospasm or stress associated with cocaine use can also precipitate coronary artery plaque rupture (the mechanism underlying most classic heart attacks).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     Two thirds of heart attacks due to cocaine occur within three hours of cocaine use; the risk of a heart attack is 24-fold higher than normal in the first sixty minutes after using cocaine. Cocaine has several other potentially devastating acute effects, including stroke, aortic dissection (e.g. dissection of the major artery connecting the heart to the rest of the body), life threatening heart arrhythmias, and myocarditis which can also occur with chronic use. Chronic cocaine can result in accelerated atherogenesis (i.e. accelerated plaque buildup in the coronary arteries), hypertrophy of the left ventricle, dilated cardiomyopathy, aortic aneurysms, and coronary aneurysms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Patients who are acutely intoxicated with cocaine and present with chest discomfort should be referred to an emergency room immediately for evaluation. They should undergo a chest-x-ray, an electrocardiogram, blood work to evaluate for evidence of a heart attack and non-myocardial muscle breakdown (e.g. rhabdomyolysis), and to assess kidney function, white and red blood cell counts, and liver function. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">    Cocaine intoxication is diagnosed if and when patients report recent cocaine use and through serum and urine toxicology screens (which should be performed immediately as well). If a clinician suspects that a patient is acutely intoxicated with cocaine, treatment should not be withheld while waiting for the results of the toxicology screen. Patients with acute cocaine intoxication and symptoms concerning for cerebrovascular or other cardiovascular sequelae of cocaine intoxication may also need additional imaging to assess for evidence of damage to the heart, aorta, or other blood vessels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In terms of treatment, these patients should receive benzodiazepines to help mitigate the adrenergic surge. If chest pain due to myocardial ischemia is suspected, sublingual nitroglycerin should be administered. Ongoing ischemic symptoms, as well as hypertension and tachycardia (drivers of myocardial oxygen demand) should be treated with calcium channel blockers (i.e. diltiazem or verapamil). Beta blockers should ideally be avoided until there is no cocaine remaining in the patient’s system. If beta blockers must be used, we recommend using either labetalol or carvedilol, which are non-selective inhibitors of both alpha and beta receptors (note: other beta blockers that are selective for beta receptors are contraindicated due to a theoretical risk that selective beta blockade could lead to unopposed alpha-mediated arterial vasoconstriction, which could precipitate marked hypertension and even peripheral and splanchnic ischemia). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">    Alternative, and highly effective, agents for treatment of hypertension include IV nitroglycerin (which should also be used if the patient has chest pain) and IV nitroprusside. Phentolamine, an alpha blocker, can be used for refractory hypertension. Patients presenting with chest pain should also receive a full dose chewable aspirin (325 mg) and 80 mg of atorvastatin (if available). Patients with ECG changes consistent with myocardial ischemia or infarction and/or elevated blood levels of cardiac biomarkers should be managed identically to patients with non-cocaine induced myocardial ischemia and infarction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Cocaine and methamphetamine addicts often have heart disease. Why? How is a diagnosis made?</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Cardiac sequelae are the second most common cause of death (behind overdose) in patients who use methamphetamines (“meth”). Like cocaine use, use of methamphetamines can produce both acute and chronic cardiovascular disease. Acute intoxication with methamphetamines produces a hyperadrenergic state, not unlike having a pheochromocytoma. The hypertension and tachycardia that result can lead to myocardial ischemia and infarction, aortic dissection, malignant arrhythmias, Takotsubo’s (stressinduced) cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     Chronic methamphetamine use can lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to persistent severe hypertension) or dilated cardiomyopathy (due to the drug’s toxic effects on myocardium), and the clinical syndrome of heart failure. In addition, chronic meth use can also cause pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Meth-associated PAH is a devastating disease, with five year mortality rates above 50%.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Diagnosing and managing acute methamphetamine intoxication:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Patients who present with suspected acute methamphetamine intoxication should undergo a full physical exam, electrocardiogram, and basic lab work (including basic metabolic panel, blood counts, clotting times (prothrombin time and international normalized ratio), liver function tests, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), urinalysis, and urine and serum toxicology screens). Amphetamine intoxication or toxicity is ultimately diagnosed by confirming the presence of amphetamines in urine or serum. However, if patients present with signs and symptoms which raise concern for amphetamine intoxication—including hyperthermia, agitation, hypertension, and tachycardia—treatment should not be delayed while waiting for these test results to return.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">If there is concern for myocardial ischemia or infarction (for example, if the patient complains of chest discomfort or shortness of breath or the ECG shows ischemic changes), then cardiac biomarkers should be checked as well (i.e. troponin I or T). Acute methamphetamine intoxication with secondary sequelae (i.e. agitation, hypertension, tachycardia) should be managed initially with sedatives (benzodiazepines and 2nd generation atypical antipsychotics).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Hyperthermia should be managed aggressively by controlling core body temperature with sedatives and, if necessary, with paralysis and intubation (but antipyretics should not be used).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Rhabdomyolysis is common, and a CPK level should always be checked in patients who are acutely intoxicated with meth. If the hypertension is refractory to treatment with an adequate trial of sedation, then nitrates and/or phentolamine should be used. Calcium channel blockers can also be used, and are effective agents for managing tachycardia that persists despite sedation. Beta-blockers should be avoided in the acute setting to avoid precipitating unopposed alpha-mediated vasoconstriction (via identical mechanisms to those described above). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     If beta blockers are necessary for chronic management of a different disease process (e.g. cardiomyopathy or coronary artery disease), then labetalol or carvedilol are the preferred agents due to their partial alphaantagonism. Myocardial infarction in the setting of methamphetamine intoxication should be managed per evidence-based guidelines for the management of heart attacks, and as described above (for cocaine). The one exception is that, if heart rate control is needed, calcium channel blockers, not beta blockers, should be used. Interestingly, monoclonal antibodies against methamphetamine have been developed and are currently in clinical trials.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Chest pain in the setting of acute methamphetamine intoxication should raise concern not only for myocardial infarction, but also for acute aortic dissection. Methamphetamine abuse is the second most common cause of acute fatal aortic dissection in the US, after hypertension. Unlike chest discomfort due to myocardial ischemia, which often starts as mild or moderate discomfort and worsens progressively over minutes-hours, chest discomfort due to aortic dissection is typically extreme from the outset.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>What does the patient PE and EKG look like if a patient has overdosed on opioids? What about when injected with Narcan and reversed? Does Methadone, when given as a MAT, have QT and other effects on the heart? What about Suboxone and the heart?</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Opiate overdose can precipitate respiratory depression and coma. The pupils will be mioitic, or “pinpoint.” Patients commonly experience mild hypotension as well. The electrocardiogram classically shows sinus bradycardia with nonspecific changes. Approximately 20% of patients will have prolongation of the QT interval. Administration of an adequate dose of Narcan rapidly reverses the respiratory depression, miosis, and coma, and can also lead to improvements in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     However, Narcan is short acting and the reversal is temporary. Thus, patients must be monitored following Narcan administration to determine if they need subsequent doses, or even initiation of an IV naloxone drip. Methadone may also cause QT prolongation but is an uncommon cause of Torsades Des Pointes, the potentially fatal arrhythmia that can result from QT prolongation. Suboxone can also cause hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, and should be used with caution in patients with established cardiovascular disease (e.g. coronary artery disease). However, I am unaware of any unique cardiovascular side effects associated with suboxone use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Does smoking have effects on the heart?</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Smoking is an extremely strong and independent risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Smoking increases the risk of these conditions in a dose dependent fashion, and no amount of smoking is safe. People who smoke less than five cigarettes per day are at increased risk for myocardial infarction relative to non-smokers. The incidence of myocardial infarction among men and women who have smoked at least twenty cigarettes per day for any period of time is three fold and six fold higher, respectively, than the incidence of myocardial infarction in never smokers. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     More generally, smoking increases the risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, arterial aneurysms, aortic dissection, blood clots, carotid artery stenosis, upper and lower extremity ischemic claudication, and death. Smoking’s deleterious cardiac, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular effects are the result of a variety of mechanisms that contribute to atherogenesis. Smoking is associated with insulin resistance and oxidization of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c, or bad cholesterol). Oxidization of LDL-c makes it more proatherogenic. Smoking also activates the sympathetic nervous system which increases heart rate and blood pressure and leads to peripheral vasoconstriction. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">    Moreover, smoking increases inflammation, which activates platelets and creates a prothrombotic milieu. Furthermore, smoking damages blood vessel walls, rendering them less elastic and promoting premature arterial stiffening; in addition, smoking promotes endothelial dysfunction, which impairs the ability of coronary arteries to vasodilate. The risks of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral artery disease and associated events decrease significantly and relatively rapidly with smoking cessation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>What about cannabis addicts or chronic smokers and the cardiologist?</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">While we know relatively less about the effects of marijuana on the cardiovascular system, there is significant and growing interest in understanding how marijuana use impacts heart and blood vessel function. We do know that smoking marijuana leads to an acute, four- to five-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction in young men. This risk persists for approximately 60 minutes following inhalation. Daily cannabis use is associated with a 1.5%-3% annual increase in the risk of myocardial infarction. There is some evidence that the mechanism underlying this increased risk is a higher likelihood of experiencing coronary artery vasospasm (as opposed to accelerated atherogenesis).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The physiologic effects of marijuana may surprise some people. Marijuana intoxication typically leads to a slowing of the reflexes, and the appearance of a relaxed state. However, marijuana use actually stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which leads to tachycardia, the release of systemic catecholamines, and increased myocardial oxygen demand. At the same time, marijuana use increases supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and increases the likelihood of experiencing orthostatic hypotension.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     There is also some evidence that marijuana use activates platelets by modulating the endocannabinoid system. Longitudinal prospective studies of cannabis users have failed to reveal evidence that chronic cannabis use leads to significant alterations body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, triglycerides, or blood glucose levels. There is no consistent evidence that marijuana use increases cardiovascular mortality. We know relatively little about whether the mode of use (i.e. smoking vs. ingestion) modifies the effects of marijuana on the cardiovascular system.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Ketamine is being used off label for depression. What are the cardiovascular risks and concern when this is done?</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This is an extremely interesting question. Ketamine is a sympathomimetic. Studies of the cardiovascular effects of Ketamine have found that the drug increases cardiac output by up to 50% in healthy subjects. However, among sicker patients, the drug’s effects appear to be more variable, with some patients experiencing augmented ventricular performance, and others demonstrating some impairment in left ventricular function due to Ketamine use (among coronary artery bypass graft patients, for example, induction of anesthesia with Ketamine has been shown to significantly reduce left ventricular stroke volume). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     Ketamine does consistently produce tachycardia and this simple fact should lead us to be cautious about using it to treat depression in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure. The cardiovascular effects of Ketamine remain incompletely characterized, and the prospect of widespread use to treat chronic illnesses like depression heightens the need to more clearly elucidate how Ketamine effects the cardiovascular system.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Withdrawal from opioids is associated with hypertension and tachycardia. Is this a concern?</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Yes—the hypertension and tachycardia which occur during opioid withdrawal can undoubtedly stress the cardiovascular system. Patients with a history of coronary artery disease (particularly those with a history of angina), patients with congestive heart failure, and those with aortic aneurysms should be monitored closely during the withdrawal period for new or worsening cardiovascular symptoms. In addition, patients’ home cardiovascular medication regimens, including beta blockers, antihypertensives, and anti-anginals (i.e. nitrates) should ideally be continued during the withdrawal period if possible in order to blunt the physiologic effects of opioid withdrawal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Are any drug withdrawal syndromes a concern to a cardiologist?</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In general, most withdrawal syndromes result in some degree of heightened sympathetic tone, which can produce hypertension and tachycardia. In patients with serious chronic cardiovascular illness, including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, valvular disease (i.e. aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, or mitral regurgitation), or arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, this sympathetic surge can precipitate symptoms or even acute decompensations. So, and this is a key point, it is the patient substrate which matters more than the specific withdrawal syndrome. Put another way, if the patient has significant cardiovascular comorbidities, any withdrawal syndrome may be dangerous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In general, I worry most about alcohol withdrawal for a few reasons. First, alcoholics regularly live with multiple comorbidities, including cardiovascular comorbidities like atrial fibrillation and heart failure (which may be due to an alcoholic cardiomyopathy). I have seen alcohol withdrawal precipitate new or recurrent atrial fibrillation, and lead to acute heart failure decompensations in patients with underlying alcoholic cardiomyopathies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     Second, alcohol withdrawal is by far the most mortal withdrawal syndrome; seizures due to withdrawal, or delirium tremens, carry a significant risk of mortality in patients without underlying cardiovascular illness, and may be even more dangerous in patients who are suffering from concomitant cardiovascular disease. Third, many alcoholics are poorly nourished, and have significant electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia (which is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     The wasting of magnesium that occurs in alcoholics is particularly concerning, because potassium repletion is ineffective in the absence of adequate serum magnesium levels. Thus, when checking basic electrolytes in an alcoholic (e.g. sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, etc.), be sure to also check magnesium levels. And, if an alcoholic is hypokalemic and you don’t have a serum magnesium level, replete the magnesium before giving potassium (or alongside the potassium). A little extra magnesium won’t have any adverse consequences, but failing to replete magnesium could result in failure to correct the low potassium level, which could have serious consequences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Which patients should an addiction rehab send to a cardiologist for evaluation?<br />
</strong>This is a difficult question to answer with high specificity.  First, any patient with new or concerning cardiovascular symptoms or confirmed cardiovascular disease, including 1) exertional chest discomfort; 2) documentation of a new or recurrent arrhythmia; 3) new exertional shortness of breath; and/or 4) new signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure, including exertional shortness of breath, new or progressive lower extremity edema, and/or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea, should be evaluated by a cardiologist.  In addition, anyone with a syncopal event without a prodrome (i.e. sudden, unexplained, and unheralded syncope) or with a history of complex congenital heart disease should be referred to see a cardiologist.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     Patients with chronic, stable cardiovascular comorbidities, including coronary artery disease (with or without angina), congestive heart failure, peripheral artery disease (with or without claudication), valvular disease (i.e. aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation), and/or cerebrovascular disease do not necessarily need to be seen by a cardiologist while they are in Rehab, and provided they remain stable and are able to continue their long term outpatient treatment regimens for these conditions. However, a rehab should generally have a low threshold to engage a cardiologist in the management of any patient with complex, chronic cardiovascular disease.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>What are the CVD effects of alcohol use, abuse, and addiction? Alcohol users have a variety of CV effects including noticing that their heart skips a beat or so…is this related to alcohol abusers or alcoholics heart blocks?<br />
</strong>Modest alcohol consumption—two or fewer drinks per night for a man, and one drink per night for a woman— has been shown to be healthy, and may even reduce all-cause mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular disease. However, when consumed in greater quantities, alcohol is a cardiotoxin. People who abuse or are dependent on alcohol have a heightened risk of arrhythmias—including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and ventricular arrhythmias (due to electrolyte abnormalities or an alcoholic cardiomyopathy)—and alcoholic cardiomyopathy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     Alcoholic cardiomyopathies can be profound; I have taken care of daily drinkers who present with severe, bi-ventricular dysfunction and left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) of 10%-15% (normal is 52- 70%). Importantly, alcoholic cardiomyopathy is usually not this fulminant. Many daily drinkers may suffer from very mild, and even subclinical, forms of this cardiomyopathy, and their LVEF may be normal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">However, in these patients the cardiotoxic effects of alcohol may still predispose to premature atrial and ventricular beats—which they may experience, and describe, as “skipped beats.” As noted above, alcoholic cardiomyopathy increases the risk of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and prior work shows that the risk of ventricular tachycardia in alcoholic cardiomyopathy is comparable to that seen in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathies. The electrolyte abnormalities commonly found in alcoholics—most notably hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia— further compound the risk for these arrhythmias.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Fortunately, alcoholic cardiomyopathy is usually a reversible process; I have multiple patients whose LVEF has improved from this 10%-15% range (while drinking daily) to 50% or more (essentially normal) after one-two years of abstinence from alcohol and adherence with traditional heart failure therapies. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy may at times reach a point of irreversibility, of course, but, broadly speaking, it has a very favorable prognosis if long term abstinence can be achieved.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Alcoholic abuse/dependence is also associated with a modestly increased risk for myocardial infarction, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">As the legalization of marijuana continues to spread among various states within the U.S., researchers, and physicians are trying to fully grasp the potential health hazards of the recreational use of the drug. Since marijuana can be consumed through a variety of methods—e.g.<em>,</em> eating, smoking, or vaporizing—it is important to understand if and how drug delivery methods affect users. With that in mind, a recent study from investigators at Portland State University found benzene and other potentially cancer-causing chemicals in the vapor produced by butane hash oil, a cannabis extract.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Findings from the new study—published recently in <em>ACS Omega </em>in an article entitled “<a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsomega.7b01130" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toxicant Formation in Dabbing: The Terpene Story</a>”—raises health concerns about dabbing, or vaporizing hash oil—a practice that is growing in popularity, especially in states that have legalized medical or recreational marijuana. Dabbing is already controversial. The practice consists of placing a small amount of cannabis extract (a dab) on a heated surface and inhaling the resulting vapor. The practice has raised concerns because it produces extremely elevated levels of cannabinoids—the active ingredients in marijuana.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;Given the widespread legalization of marijuana in the U.S., it is imperative to study the full toxicology of its consumption to guide future policy,&#8221; noted senior study author Robert Strongin, Ph.D., professor of organic chemistry at Portland State University. &#8220;The results of these studies clearly indicate that dabbing, while considered a form of vaporization, may, in fact, deliver significant amounts of toxins.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Dr. Strongin and his colleagues analyzed the chemical profile of terpenes—the fragrant oils in marijuana and other plants—by vaporizing them in much the same way as a user would vaporize hash oil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">“The practice of &#8216;dabbing&#8217; with butane hash oil has emerged with great popularity in states that have legalized cannabis,” the authors wrote. “Despite their growing popularity, the degradation product profiles of these new products have not been extensively investigated.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The authors continued, stating that the current study focused on the “chemistry of myrcene and other common terpenes found in cannabis extracts. Methacrolein, benzene, and several other products of concern to human health were formed under the conditions that simulated real-world dabbing. The terpene degradation products observed are consistent with those reported in the atmospheric chemistry literature.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Many of the terpenes that the researchers discovered in the vaporized hash oil are also used in e-cigarette liquids. Moreover, previous experiments by Dr. Strongin and his colleagues found similar toxic chemicals in e-cigarette vapor when the devices were used at high-temperature settings. The dabbing experiments in the current study produced benzene—a known carcinogen—at levels many times higher than the ambient air, the researchers noted. It also produced high levels of methacrolein, a chemical similar to acrolein, another carcinogen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">“The results of these studies clearly indicate that dabbing, although considered a form of vaporization, may, in fact, deliver significant amounts of toxic degradation products,” the authors concluded. “The difficulty users find in controlling the nail temperature put[s] users at risk of exposing themselves to not only methacrolein but also benzene. Additionally, the heavy focus on terpenes as additives seen as of late in the cannabis industry is of great concern due to the oxidative liability of these compounds when heated. This research also has significant implications for flavored e-cigarette products due to the extensive use of terpenes as flavorings.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">We provide a systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of cannabinoids in palliative medicine. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and http://clinicaltrials.gov, and a selection of cancer journals were searched up until 15th of March 2017. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     Of the 108 screened studies, nine studies with a total of 1561 participants were included. Overall, the nine studies were at moderate risk of bias. The quality of evidence comparing cannabinoids with placebo was rated according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation as low or very low because of indirectness, imprecision, and potential reporting bias. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     In cancer patients, there were no significant differences between cannabinoids and placebo for improving caloric intake (standardized mean differences [SMD]:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, cannabinoids were superior to placebo for weight gain (SMD: 0.57 [0.22; 0.92]; P = 0.001) and appetite (SMD: 0.57 [0.11; 1.03]; P = 0.02) but not for nausea/vomiting (SMD: 0.20 [-0.15, 0.54]; P = 0.26). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     Regarding side effects in cancer patients, there were no differences between cannabinoids and placebo in symptoms of dizziness (RD: 0.03 [-0.02; 0.08]; P = 0.23) or poor mental health (RD: -0.01 [-0.04; 0.03]; P = 0.69), whereas in HIV patients, there was a significant increase in mental health symptoms (RD: 0.05 [0.00; 0.11]; P = 0.05). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     Tolerability (measured by the number of withdrawals because of adverse events) did not differ significantly in cancer (RD: 1.15 [0.80; 1.66]; P = 0.46) and HIV patients (RD: 1.87 [0.60; 5.84]; P = 0.28). Safety did not differ in cancer (RD: 1.12 [0.86; 1.46]; P = 0.39) or HIV patients (4.51 [0.54; 37.45]; P = 0.32) although there was large uncertainty about the latter reflected in the width of the CI. In one moderate quality study of 469 cancer patients with cancer-associated anorexia, megestrol was superior to cannabinoids in improving appetite, producing &gt;10% weight gain and tolerability. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     In another study comparing megestrol to dronabinol in HIV patients, megestrol treatment led to higher weight gain without any differences in tolerability and safety. We found no convincing, unbiased, high quality evidence suggesting that cannabinoids are of value for anorexia or cachexia in cancer or HIV patients.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Question</strong>:  I have Type 1 diabetes and have used marijuana for years to control my blood sugar.  I&#8217;ve seen my blood sugar drop 100 points in five minutes with marijuana, faster than my Humalog insulin can manage.  Why is that?  Will medical marijuana ever go mainstream?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Answer</strong>:  Marijuana, or cannabis, contains more than 100 active chemical compounds.  Known as cannabinoids, each behaves differently in the body.  As the number of states that allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes continues to grow, so does the body of evidence that many of the compounds found within the plant have therapeutic potential.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     The challenge to investigate medical claims regarding cannabis is that it remains illegal at the federal level.  Research is subject to numerous restrictions.  Even so, various studies and clinical trials are moving forward.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     We found that you&#8217;re not alone in noticing its effect on blood sugar.  However, much of what we found is anecdotal evidence, which lacks scientific rigor.  The study of cannabis and its potential effects on diabetes is in the early stages, which much of the work done in mice and on donated tissue samples.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     Until researchers are able to work extensively with human populations, the how and why of the effects of cannabis on the complex physiologic processes encompassed by diabetes will remain educated guesses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     Preliminary research suggests that certain cannabinoids may help with glucose control.  Some studies have found that cannabis can have a positive effect on insulin resistance.  A study published in 2016 in a journal of the American Diabetes Association found that THCV, one of the cannabinoids that are not psychoactive, improved glycemic control in some individuals with Type 2 diabetes.  Another study that same year drew a link between cannabidiol, a compound in cannabis, and a decrease in inflammation of the pancreas.  In an observational study using data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers found the incidence of diabetes among regular cannabis users to be measurably lower than that of the population at large.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     The results of several other recent studies contradict a number of these pro-cannabis findings.  So, basically, the jury is still out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">     Although cannabis shows promise in the area of diabetes, science has yet to catch up with the claims being made.  In the research that has been done, the reason for the effects of cannabis is not yet fully understood.  Interest in the subject is strong, though, and continues to grow.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Step 1. Target states with ballot initiatives. </strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>Tell voters patients need marijuana for medical use, despite a lack of supporting evidence. Deny evidence that the drug is addictive, harmful to the developing brain, and is associated with increased traffic fatalities, ER visits, hospitalizations, and mental illnesses. [Of 26 ballot initiative states, 19 have legalized marijuana for medical use since 1996, 4 more have initiatives pending this November, and two have legalized cannabidiol (CBD). Only one initiative state, Nebraska, remains free of “medical” or “recreational” pot.] </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Tired of the legislature’s refusal to legalize marijuana for medical use, the Marijuana Policy Project from Washington DC, has brought 72 percent of the $267,000 raised to place a ballot initiative on the state’s November ballot, contributing 44 percent &#8212; $118,000 – on its own. MPP, along with the Drug Policy Alliance and NORML, are the three organizations most responsible for the legalization of marijuana in the US.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>Once you’ve got marijuana legalized for medical use, expand the number of conditions that are eligible for its use.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Regulators in Michigan are thinking about adding 22 more conditions to the list of 14 that are currently eligible for “medical” marijuana use. (States have “approved” marijuana to treat more than 70 different conditions thus far.)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Two new, privately funded studies were announced today. One, a $740,000 grant, is to the University of Utah to study how THC and CBD interact with the brain. The other, a $4.7 million grant, is to the University of San Diego School of Medicine’s Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research to study childhood autism. The latter study (and presumably the former) will administer pharmaceutical-grade synthesized CBD manufactured by INSYS Therapeutics. Its CBD product is in Phase 2 clinical trials seeking FDA approval. It looks nothing like the picture above that accompanies <em>The Salt Lake Tribune’s</em> story or the picture below that accompanies the <em>Newswise.com </em>story.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">One caveat: The gifts to the two universities come from the Rae and Tye Noorda Foundation of Utah in partnership with the Wholistic Research and Education Foundation of California. Andy Noorda, who serves as a board member of his deceased parents’ foundation, co-founded the Wholistic Research and Education Foundation along with Mana Artisan Botanics of Hawaii. The company makes CBD products from hemp grown in Colorado. We have learned from alcohol and tobacco that industry-funded research is not always trustworthy.</span></p>

Among other provisions, the initiative calls for a 10 percent excise tax and a 6 percent sales tax. While allowing communities to ban marijuana businesses within their boundaries, 15 percent of those revenues would go to “communities that allow marijuana businesses within their borders and 15 percent would go to counties where marijuana business are located.”</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The proliferation of retail boutiques in California did not really bother him, Evan told me, but the billboards did. Advertisements for delivery, advertisements promoting the substance for relaxation, for fun, for health. &#8220;Shop. It&#8217;s legal.&#8221; &#8220;Hello marijuana, goodbye hangover.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s not a trigger,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;But it is in your face.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">When we spoke, he had been sober for a hard-fought seven weeks: seven weeks of sleepless nights, intermittent nausea, irritability, trouble focusing, and psychological turmoil. There were upsides, he said, in terms of reduced mental fog, a fatter wallet, and a growing sense of confidence that he could quit. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a &#8216;can&#8217; as much as a &#8216;must,'&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Evan, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of the professional repercussions, has a self-described cannabis-use disorder. If not necessarily because of legalization, but alongside legalization, such problems are becoming more common: The share of adults with one has doubled since the early aughts, as the share of cannabis users who consume it daily or near-daily has jumped nearly 50 percent-all &#8220;in the context of increasingly permissive cannabis legislation, attitudes, and lower risk perception,&#8221; as the National Institutes of Health put it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Public-health experts worry about the increasingly potent options available, and the striking number of constant users. &#8220;Cannabis is potentially a real public-health problem,&#8221; said Mark A. R. Kleiman, a professor of public policy at New York University. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t obvious to me 25 years ago, when 9 percent of self-reported cannabis users over the last month reported daily or near-daily use. I always was prepared to say, &#8216;No, it&#8217;s not a very abusable drug. Nine percent of anybody will do something stupid.&#8217; But that number is now [something like] 40 percent.&#8221; They argue that state and local governments are setting up legal regimes without sufficient public-health protection, with some even warning that the country is replacing one form of reefer madness with another, careening from treating cannabis as if it were as dangerous as heroin to treating it as if it were as benign as kombucha.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But cannabis is not benign, even if it is relatively benign, compared with alcohol, opiates, and cigarettes, among other substances. Thousands of Americans are finding their own use problematic-in a climate where pot products are getting more potent, more socially acceptable to use, and yet easier to come by, not that it was particularly hard before.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">For Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, the most compelling evidence of the deleterious effects comes from users themselves. &#8220;In large national surveys, about one in 10 people who smoke it say they have a lot of problems. They say things like, &#8216;I have trouble quitting. I think a lot about quitting and I can&#8217;t do it. I smoked more than I intended to. I neglect responsibilities.&#8217; There are plenty of people who have problems with it, in terms of things like concentration, short-term memory, and motivation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People will say, &#8216;Oh, that&#8217;s just you fuddy-duddy doctors.&#8217; Actually, no. It&#8217;s millions of people who use the drug who say that it causes problems.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Users or former users I spoke with described lost jobs, lost marriages, lost houses, lost money, lost time. Foreclosures and divorces. Weight gain and mental-health problems. And one other thing: the problem of convincing other people that what they were experiencing was real. A few mentioned jokes about Doritos, and comments implying that the real issue was that they were lazy stoners. Others mentioned the common belief that you can be &#8220;psychologically&#8221; addicted to pot, but not &#8220;physically&#8221; or &#8220;really&#8221; addicted. The condition remains misunderstood, discounted, and strangely invisible, even as legalization and white-marketization pitches ahead.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The country is in the midst of a volte-face on marijuana. The federal government still classifies cannabis as Schedule I drug, with no accepted medical use. (Meth and PCP, among other drugs, are Schedule II.) Politicians still argue it is a gateway to the use of things like heroin and cocaine. The country still spends billions of dollars fighting it in a bloody and futile drug war, and still arrests more people for offenses related to cannabis than it does for all violent crimes combined.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Yet dozens of states have pushed ahead with legalization for medical or recreational purposes, given that for decades physicians have argued that marijuana&#8217;s health risks have been overstated and its medical uses overlooked; activists have stressed prohibition&#8217;s tremendous fiscal cost and far worse human cost; and researchers have convincingly argued that cannabis is far less dangerous than alcohol. A solid majority of Americans support legalization nowadays.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Academics and public-health officials, though, have raised the concern that cannabis&#8217;s real risks have been overlooked or underplayed-perhaps as part of a counter-reaction to federal prohibition, and perhaps because millions and millions cannabis users have no problems controlling their use. &#8220;Part of how legalization was sold was with this assumption that there was no harm, in reaction to the message that everyone has smoked marijuana was going to ruin their whole life,&#8221; Humphreys told me. It was a point Kleiman agreed with. &#8220;I do think that not legalization, but the legalization movement, does have a lot on its conscience now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The mantra about how this is a harmless, natural, and non-addictive substance-it&#8217;s now known by everybody. And it&#8217;s a lie.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Thousands of businesses, as well as local governments earning tax money off of sales, are now literally invested in that lie. &#8220;The liquor companies are salivating,&#8221; Matt Karnes of GreenWave Advisors told me. &#8220;They can&#8217;t wait to come in full force.&#8221; He added that Big Pharma was targeting the medical market, with Wall Street, Silicon Valley, food businesses, and tobacco companies aiming at the recreational market.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Sellers are targeting broad swaths of the consumer market-soccer moms, recent retirees, folks looking to replace their nightly glass of chardonnay with a precisely dosed, low-calorie, and hangover-free mint. Many have consciously played up cannabis as a lifestyle product, a gift to give yourself, like a nice crystal or an antioxidant face cream. &#8220;This is not about marijuana,&#8221; one executive at the California retailer MedMen recently argued. &#8220;This is about the people who use cannabis for all the reasons people have used cannabis for hundreds of years. Yes for recreation, just like alcohol, but also for wellness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Evan started off smoking with his friends when they were playing sports or video games, lighting up to chill out after his nine-to-five as a paralegal at a law office. But that soon became couch-lock, and he lost interest in working out, going out, doing anything with his roommates. Then came a lack of motivation and the slow erosion of ambition, and law school moving further out of reach. He started smoking before work and after work. Eventually, he realized it was impossible to get through the day without it. &#8220;I was smoking anytime I had to do anything boring, and it took a long time before I realized that I wasn&#8217;t doing anything without getting stoned,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">His first attempts to reduce his use went miserably, as the consequences on his health and his life piled up. He gained nearly 40 pounds, he said, when he stopped working out and cooking his own food at home. He recognized that he was just barely getting by at work, and was continually worried about getting fired. Worse, his friends were unsympathetic to the idea that he was struggling and needed help. &#8220;[You have to] try to convince someone that something that is hurting you is hurting you,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Other people who found their use problematic or had managed to quit, none of whom wanted to use their names, described similar struggles and consequences. &#8220;I was running two companies at the time, and fitting smoking in between running those companies. Then, we sold those companies and I had a whole lot of time on my hands,&#8221; one other former cannabis user told me. &#8220;I just started sitting around smoking all the time. And things just came to a halt. I was in terrible shape. I was depressed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Lax regulatory standards and aggressive commercialization in some states have compounded some existing public-health risks, raised new ones, and failed to tamp down on others, experts argue. In terms of compounding risks, many cite the availability of hyper-potent marijuana products. &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing these increases in the strength of cannabis, as we are also seeing an emergence of new types of products,&#8221; such as edibles, tinctures, vape pens, sublingual sprays, and concentrates, Ziva Cooper, an associate professor of clinical neurobiology in the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, told me. &#8220;A lot of these concentrates can have up to 90 percent THC,&#8221; she said, whereas the kind of flower you could get 30 years ago was far, far weaker. Scientists are not sure how such high-octane products affect people&#8217;s bodies, she said, but worry that they might have more potential for raising tolerance, introducing brain damage, and inculcating dependence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">As for new risks: In many stores, budtenders are providing medical advice with no licensing or training whatsoever. &#8220;I&#8217;m most scared of the advice to smoke marijuana during pregnancy for cramps,&#8221; said Humphreys, arguing that sellers were providing recommendations with no scientific backing, good or bad, at all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In terms of long-standing risks, the lack of federal involvement in legalization has meant that marijuana products are not being safety-tested like pharmaceuticals; measured and dosed like food products; subjected to agricultural-safety and pesticide standards like crops; and held to labelling standards like alcohol. (Different states have different rules and testing regimes, complicating things further.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Health experts also cited an uncomfortable truth about allowing a vice product to be widely available, loosely regulated, and fully commercialized: Heavy users will make up a huge share of sales, with businesses wanting them to buy more and spend more and use more, despite any health consequences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;The reckless way that we are legalizing marijuana so far is mind-boggling from a public-health perspective,&#8221; Kevin Sabet, an Obama administration official and a founder of the non-profit Smart Approaches to Marijuana, told me. &#8220;The issue now is that we have lobbyists, special interests, and people whose motivation is to make money that are writing all of these laws and taking control of the conversation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This is not to say that prohibition is a more attractive policy, or that legalization has proven a public-health disaster. &#8220;The big-picture view is that the vast majority of people who use cannabis are not going to be problematic users,&#8221; said Jolene Forman, an attorney at the Drug Policy Alliance. &#8220;They&#8217;re not going to have a cannabis-use disorder. They&#8217;re going to have a healthy relationship with it. And criminalization actually increases the harms related to cannabis, and so having like a strictly regulated market where there can be limits on advertising, where only adults can purchase cannabis, and where you&#8217;re going to get a wide variety of products makes sense.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Still, strictly regulated might mean more strictly regulated than today, at least in some places, drug-policy experts argue. &#8220;Here, what we&#8217;ve done is we&#8217;ve copied the alcohol industry fully formed, and then on steroids with very minimal regulation,&#8221; Humphreys said. &#8220;The oversight boards of a number of states are the industry themselves. We&#8217;ve learned enough about capitalism to know that&#8217;s very dangerous.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A number of policy reforms might tamp down on problem use and protect consumers, without quashing the legal market or pivoting back to prohibition and all its harms. One extreme option would be to require markets to be non-commercial: The District of Columbia, for instance, does not allow recreational sales, but does allow home cultivation and the gifting of marijuana products among adults. &#8220;If I got to pick a policy, that would probably be it,&#8221; Kleiman told me. &#8220;That would be a fine place to be if we were starting from prohibition, but we are starting from patchwork legalization. As the Vermont farmer says, I don&#8217;t think you can get there from here. I fear its time has passed. It&#8217;s generally true that the drug warriors have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">There&#8217;s no shortage of other reasonable proposals, many already in place or under consideration in some states. The government could run marijuana stores, as in Canada. States could require budtenders to have some training or to refrain from making medical claims. They could ask users to set a monthly THC purchase cap and remain under it. They could cap the amount of THC in products, and bar producers from making edibles that are attractive to kids, like candies. A ban or limits on marijuana advertising are also options, as is requiring cannabis dispensaries to post public-health information.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Then, there are THC taxes, designed to hit heavy users the hardest. Some drug-policy experts argue that such levies would just push people from marijuana to alcohol, with dangerous health consequences. &#8220;It would be like saying, &#8216;Let&#8217;s let the beef and pork industries market and do whatever they wish, but let&#8217;s have much tougher restrictions on tofu and seitan,'&#8221; said Mason Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project. &#8220;In light of the current system, where alcohol is so prevalent and is a more harmful substance, it is bad policy to steer people toward that.&#8221; Yet reducing the commercial appeal of all vice products-cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana-is an option, if not necessarily a popular one.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Perhaps most important might be reintroducing some reasonable skepticism about cannabis, especially until scientists have a better sense of the health effects of high-potency products, used frequently. Until then, listening to and believing the hundreds of thousands of users who argue marijuana is not always benign might be a good start.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It is no accident that in almost the same week both Australia and UK have decided that cannabis is to be recommended for a host of medical disorders mostly in advance of gold standard clinical trials. This is a direct product of the organized transnational global drug liberalization movement orchestrated from New York.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">I wish to most respectfully disagree with the points made by BMJ editor Dr. Godlee. Diarrhoea and colic occur in cannabis withdrawal; Crohn’s disease has a prominent immune aspect, and cannabinoids are likely acting partly as immune modulators. Statements from patients are uninterpretable without understanding the treatments tried, their withdrawal symptomatology and their personal preferences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Most importantly, as Dr Godlee states, cannabis is a mixture of 104 cannabinoids. The tide cannot be both out and in at the same time. Medicines in western nations are universally pure substances. This comprises a fundamental difficulty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Medical research has confirmed that the body’s endocannabinoid system is a finely regulated and highly complex system which is involved in the detailed regulation of essentially all body systems including the brain and cardiovascular systems and stem cell niches.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Studies have shown that the rate of use of cannabis by expecting mothers closely parallels that in the wider community. In fact given the long half-life of cannabis in tissues even were a maternal habitual smoker to stop when she discovered her pregnancy, her infant would continue to be exposed to her on-board cannabinoid load for several months afterwards during critical periods of organogenesis. And other studies show that the father’s cannabis use is even more damaging than the mothers’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Whilst much research has focussed on the effects of endocannabinoids in the adult brain relatively little research has looked at the impact of these same effects in the developing brain of the foetus and neonate. Whilst the brain stem is almost devoid of type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) they are in high concentration in many parts of the midbrain, limbic system, subcortical regions and cerebral and cerebellar cortices. Foetal CB1Rs have been shown to play key roles in virtually all aspects of brain development including neural stem cell function, determining the ratio of glial v neuronal differentiation, brain inflammation, axonal growth cone guidance, stem cell niche function and signalling, blood flow signalling, white matter and CNS tract formation, glial cell differentiation, myelination, dendrite formation, neural migration into the developing cortex, synapse formation and integration of newly formed neurons into the neural network. They are also found in high density on endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria from which latter they indirectly control major issues including cognition, DNA maintenance and repair systems both by supplying energy and by metabolite shuttle and RNA signalling.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Hence it is not surprising that gestational cannabis has been linked with a clear continuum of defects, including in protracted longitudinal studies from Pittsburgh, Ottawa and Netherlands impaired cortical and executive functioning; reduced spatial judgement; the need to recruit more brain to perform similar computational tasks; microcephaly; lifelong smaller heads and smaller brains; anencephaly (in two CDC studies), and increased foetal death. This progression clearly reflects a spectrum of congenital neurological impairment which is quite consistent with the known distribution of CB1Rs mainly across the foetal and adult forebrain and midbrain and its derivatives.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It is also consistent with a recent explosion of autism in Colorado, California, New Jersey and many other sites in USA and internationally in recent years. Moreover cannabis induced synpatopathy closely mimics that seen in autism, as do similar white matter disconnection endophenotypes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A similar scenario plays out in the cardiovasculature. The American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics issued a joint statement as long ago as 2007 noting that foetal cannabis exposure was linked with increased rates of ventricular septal defect and Ebstein&#8217;s anomaly (complex tricuspid valvopathy). This is consistent with recent Colorado experience where ventricular septal defect has risen from 43.9 to 59.4 / 10,000 live births, or 35.3% 2000-2013. Both of these structures are derivatives of the endocardial cushions which are rich in CB1Rs. Concerningly Colorado has also seen a 262% rise in atrial septal defects over the same period. Exposure to other drugs does not explain this change as they were falling across this period. It has also been reported that the father’s use of cannabis is the strongest environmental factor implicated in cardiovascular defects, here involving transposition of the great arteries, which is a derivative of the conoventricular ridges immediately distal and continuous with embryonic endocardial cushions, and also rich in CB1Rs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Similar findings play out in gastroschisis. There is an impressive concordance amongst the larger studies of the relationship of gastroschisis and congenital cannabis exposure where senior Canadian authors concluded that cannabis caused a three-fold rise in gastroschisis, consistent with a high density of CB1Rs on the umbilical vessels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">And cannabis has also been implicated as an indirect chromosomal clastogen and indirect genotoxin through its effect to disrupt the mitotic spindle by microtubule inhibition, and likely DNA maintenance and repair by its effect on nuclear actin filaments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Moreover cannabidiol has been shown to alter the epigenome, to be genotoxic, and to bind to CB1Rs at high doses, so the simplistic case that “Cannabidiol is good” – fails.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">These considerations imply that if clinical trials continue to show efficacy for additional indications for cannabinoids, their genotoxic and teratogenic potential, from both mother and father, will need to be carefully balanced with their clinical utility. They also imply that these issues will need to be more widely canvassed and discussed in order to introduce more balance into the heavily biased present global media coverage of the highly misleading misnomer “medical cannabis”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Only once before has a known teratogen been marketed globally: the thalidomide disaster is the proximate reason for modern pharmaceutical laws. With its widespread uptake, rising concentrations, asymptotic genotoxic dose-response curves and actions through the paternal line cannabis could be much worse.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000ff;">Core deficits in social functioning are associated with various neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, yet biomarker identification and the development of effective pharmacological interventions has been limited. Recent data suggest the intriguing possibility that endogenous cannabinoids, a class of lipid neuromodulators generally implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, may contribute to species-typical social functioning. Systematic study of the endogenous cannabinoid signaling could, therefore, yield novel approaches to understand the neurobiological underpinnings of atypical social functioning.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000ff;"> This article provides a critical review of the major components of the endogenous cannabinoid system (for example, primary receptors and effectors—Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol) and the contributions of cannabinoid signaling to social functioning. Data are evaluated in the context of Research Domain Criteria constructs (for example, anxiety, chronic stress, reward learning, motivation, declarative and working memory, affiliation and attachment, and social communication) to enable interrogation of endogenous cannabinoid signaling in social functioning across diagnostic categories. The empirical evidence reviewed strongly supports the role for dysregulated cannabinoid signaling in the pathophysiology of social functioning deficits observed in brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder. Moreover, these findings indicate that the endogenous cannabinoid system holds exceptional promise as a biological marker of, and potential treatment target for, neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairments in social functioning.</span></p>

<span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Synaptic cell-adhesion molecules and their interactions with other molecular pathways affect both synapse formation and its function (Varoqueaux et al., 2006; Sudhof, 2008; Bemben et al., 2015a). Neurexins are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that interact with neuroligins and other postsynaptic partners. Neurexins are encoded by three genes, each of which encodes a long and short isoform, termed α- and β-neurexins, respectively (Sudhof, 2008). Interestingly, despite studies linking neurexins to autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders (Leone et al., 2010; Rabaneda et al., 2014), the precise cellular mechanisms underlying the role of neurexins in cognition remain poorly understood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Since most biochemical studies of neurexins have focused on β-neurexins, investigating the synaptic actions of β-neurexins is particularly imperative. In their timely Cell article, Anderson et al. reported that β-neurexins selectively modulate synaptic strength at excitatory synapses by regulating postsynaptic endocannabinoid synthesis, describing an unexpected trans-synaptic mechanism for β-neurexins to control neural circuits via endocannabinoid signaling. </span></p>

<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000ff;">α- and β-neurexins are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules implicated in autism and schizophrenia. We find that although β-neurexins are expressed at much lower levels than α-neurexins, conditional knockout of β-neurexins with continued expression of α-neurexins dramatically decreased neurotransmitter release at excitatory synapses in cultured cortical neurons. The β-neurexin knockout phenotype was attenuated by CB1-receptor inhibition which blocks presynaptic endocannabinoid signaling or by 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthesis inhibition which impairs postsynaptic endocannabinoid release. In synapses formed by CA1-region pyramidal neurons onto burst-firing subiculum neurons, presynaptic in vivo knockout of β-neurexins aggravated endocannabinoid-mediated inhibition of synaptic transmission and blocked LTP; presynaptic CB1-receptor antagonists or postsynaptic 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthesis inhibition again reversed this block. Moreover, conditional knockout of β-neurexins in CA1-region neurons impaired contextual fear memories. Thus, our data suggest that presynaptic β-neurexins control synaptic strength in excitatory synapses by regulating postsynaptic 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthesis, revealing an unexpected role for β-neurexins in the endocannabinoid-dependent regulation of neural circuits.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;We know that when citizens of Illinois are informed that marijuana is already decriminalized, only 23% want to fully legalize it,&#8221; said Andy Duran, Executive Director of Linking Efforts Against Drugs (LEAD). &#8220;Lack of knowledge and confusion is the fuel that drives the commercial marijuana market forward, just like tobacco before it.

Apart from updating the literature, this article focuses on clinical studies and CBD potential interactions with other drugs.</span></p>
<div>
<p id="__p2"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Results:</strong> In general, the often described favorable safety profile of CBD in humans was confirmed and extended by the reviewed research. The majority of studies were performed for treatment of epilepsy and psychotic disorders. Here, the most commonly reported side effects were tiredness, diarrhea, and changes of appetite/weight. In comparison with other drugs, used for the treatment of these medical conditions, CBD has a better side effect profile. This could improve patients&#8217; compliance and adherence to treatment. CBD is often used as adjunct therapy. Therefore, more clinical research is warranted on CBD action on hepatic enzymes, drug transporters, and interactions with other drugs and to see if this mainly leads to positive or negative effects, for example, reducing the needed clobazam doses in epilepsy and therefore clobazam&#8217;s side effects.</span></p>
<p id="__p3" class="p p-last"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This review also illustrates that some important toxicological parameters are yet to be studied, for example, if CBD has an effect on hormones. Additionally, more clinical trials with a greater number of participants and longer chronic CBD administration are still lacking.</span></p>

<p id="__p4" class="p p-first"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Since several years, other pharmacologically relevant constituents of the Cannabis plant, apart from Δ9-THC, have come into the focus of research and legislation. The most prominent of those is cannabidiol (CBD). In contrast to Δ9-THC, it is nonintoxicating, but exerts a number of beneficial pharmacological effects. For instance, it is anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory, antiemetic, and antipsychotic. Moreover, neuroprotective properties have been shown.<sup><a id="__tag_633155995" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B1">1</a>,<a class=" bibr popnode" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B2">2</a></sup> Consequently, it could be used at high doses for the treatment of a variety of conditions ranging in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and dementia, as well as diabetes and nausea.<sup><a id="__tag_633156015" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B1">1</a>,<a class=" bibr popnode" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B2">2</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="__p5"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">At lower doses, it has physiological effects that promote and maintain health, including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotection effects. For instance, CBD is more effective than vitamin C and E as a neuroprotective antioxidant and can ameliorate skin conditions such as acne.<sup><a id="__tag_633155966" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B3">3</a>,<a id="__tag_633155956" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B4">4</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="__p6"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The comprehensive review of 132 original studies by Bergamaschi et al. describes the safety profile of CBD, mentioning several properties: catalepsy is not induced and physiological parameters are not altered (heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature). Moreover, psychological and psychomotor functions are not adversely affected. The same holds true for gastrointestinal transit, food intake, and absence of toxicity for nontransformed cells. Chronic use and high doses of up to 1500 mg per day have been repeatedly shown to be well tolerated by humans.<sup><a id="__tag_633155983" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B1">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="__p7"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Nonetheless, some side effects have been reported for CBD, but mainly <em>in vitro</em> or in animal studies. They include alterations of cell viability, reduced fertilization capacity, and inhibition of hepatic drug metabolism and drug transporters (e.g., p-glycoprotein).<sup><a id="__tag_633155965" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B1">1</a></sup>Consequently, more human studies have to be conducted to see if these effects also occur in humans. In these studies, a large enough number of subjects have to be enrolled to analyze long-term safety aspects and CBD possible interactions with other substances.</span></p>
<p id="__p8" class="p p-last"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This review will build on the clinical studies mentioned by Bergamaschi et al. and will update their survey with new studies published until September 2016.</span></p>

<h2 id="s002title" class="head no_bottom_margin ui-helper-clearfix"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Relevant Preclinical Studies</span></h2>
<p id="__p9" class="p p-first"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Before we discuss relevant animal research on CBD possible effects on various parameters, several important differences between route of administration and pharmacokinetics between human and animal studies have to be mentioned. First, CBD has been studied in humans using oral administration or inhalation. Administration in rodents often occures either via intraperitoneal injection or via the oral route. Second, the plasma levels reached via oral administration in rodents and humans can differ. Both these observations can lead to differing active blood concentrations of CBD.<sup><a id="__tag_633156011" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B1">1</a>,<a id="__tag_633155948" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B5">5</a>,<a id="__tag_633422242" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B6">6</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="__p10"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In addition, it is possible that CBD targets differ between humans and animals. Therefore, the same blood concentration might still lead to different effects. Even if the targets, to which CBD binds, are the same in both studied animals and humans, for example, the affinity or duration of CBD binding to its targets might differ and consequently alter its effects.</span></p>
<p id="__p11"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The following study, which showed a positive effect of CBD on obsessive compulsive behavior in mice and reported no side effects, exemplifies the existing pharmacokinetic differences.<sup><a id="__tag_633156012" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B5">5</a></sup> When mice and humans are given the same CBD dose, more of the compound becomes available in the mouse organism. This higher bioavailability, in turn, can cause larger CBD effects.</span></p>
<p id="__p12"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Deiana et al. administered 120 mg/kg CBD either orally or intraperitoneally and measured peak plasma levels.<sup><a id="__tag_633156029" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B5">5</a></sup> The group of mice, which received oral CBD, had plasma levels of 2.2 μg/ml CBD. In contrast, i.p. injections resulted in peak plasma levels of 14.3 μg/ml. Administering 10 mg/kg oral CBD to humans leads to blood levels of 0.01 μg/ml.<sup><a id="__tag_633422230" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B6">6</a></sup> This corresponds to human blood levels of 0.12 μg/ml, when 120 mg/kg CBD was given to humans. This calculation was performed assuming the pharmacokinetics of a hydrophilic compound, for simplicity&#8217;s sake. We are aware that the actual levels of the lipophilic CBD will vary.</span></p>
<p id="__p13"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A second caveat of preclinical studies is that supraphysiological concentrations of compounds are often used. This means that the observed effects, for instance, are not caused by a specific binding of CBD to one of its receptors but are due to unspecific binding following the high compound concentration, which can inactivate the receptor or transporter.</span></p>
<p id="__p14"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The following example and calculations will demonstrate this. <em>In vitro</em> studies have shown that CBD inhibits the ABC transporters P-gp (P glycoprotein also referred to as ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1=<em>ABCB1</em>; 3–100 μM CBD) and Bcrp (Breast Cancer Resistance Protein; also referred to as <em>ABCG2</em>=ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2).<sup><a id="__tag_633155944" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B7">7</a></sup> After 3 days, the P-gp protein expression was altered in leukemia cells. This can have several implications because various anticancer drugs also bind to these membrane-bound, energy-dependent efflux transporters.<sup><a id="__tag_633155990" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B1">1</a></sup> The used CBD concentrations are supraphysiological, however, 3 μM CBD approximately corresponds to plasma concentrations of 1 μg/ml. On the contrary, a 700 mg CBD oral dose reached a plasma level of 10 ng/ml.<sup><a id="__tag_633422226" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B6">6</a></sup> This means that to reach a 1 μg/ml plasma concentration, one would need to administer considerably higher doses of oral CBD. The highest ever applied CBD dose was 1500 mg.<sup><a id="__tag_633156032" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B1">1</a></sup>Consequently, more research is warranted, where the CBD effect on ABC transporters is analyzed using CBD concentrations of, for example, 0.03–0.06 μM. The rationale behind suggesting these concentrations is that studies summarized by Bih et al. on CBD effect on ABCC1 and ABCG2 in SF9 human cells showed that a CBD concentration of 0.08 μM elicited the first effect.<sup><a id="__tag_633156010" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B7">7</a></sup></span></p>

This is supported by a study, where CBD was administered in an acute and “chronic” (2 weeks) regimen, which measured anxiolytic/antidepressant effects, using behavioral and operative models (OBX=olfactory bulbectomy as model for depression).<sup><a id="__tag_633155978" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B18">18</a></sup> The only observed side effects were reduced sucrose preference, reduced food consumption and body weight in the nonoperated animals treated with CBD (50 mg/kg). Nonetheless, the behavioral tests (for OBX-induced hyperactivity and anhedonia related to depression and open field test for anxiety) in the CBD-treated OBX animals showed an improved emotional response. Using microdialysis, the researchers could also show elevated 5-HT and glutamate levels in the prefrontal cortex of OBX animals only. This area was previously described to be involved in maladaptive behavioral regulation in depressed patients and is a feature of the OBX animal model of depression. The fact that serotonin levels were only elevated in the OBX mice is similar to CBD differential action under physiological and pathological conditions.</span></p>
<p id="__p29"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A similar effect was previously described in anxiety experiments, where CBD proved to be only anxiolytic in subjects where stress had been induced before CBD administration. Elevated glutamate levels have been proposed to be responsible for ketamine&#8217;s fast antidepressant function and its dysregulation has been described in OBX mice and depressed patients.

The behavioral changes (tested with the prepulse inhibition [PPI] test) were concomitant with decreased mRNA expression of the NMDAR GluN1 subunit gene (GRN1) in the hippocampus, decreased parvalbumin expression (=a calcium-binding protein expressed in a subclass of GABAergic interneurons), and higher FosB/ΔFosB expression (=markers for neuronal activity). After 6 days of MK-801 treatment, various CBD doses were injected intraperitoneally (15, 30, 60 mg/kg) for 22 days. The two higher CBD doses had beneficial effects comparable to the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine and also attenuated the MK-801 effects on the three markers mentioned above.

Valvassori et al. therefore used an animal model of amphetamine-induced hyperactivity to model one of the symptoms of mania. Rats were treated for 14 days with various CBD concentrations (15, 30, 60 mg/kg daily i.p.). Whereas CBD did not have an effect on locomotion, it did increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and could protect against amphetamine-induced oxidative damage in proteins of the hippocampus and striatum. No adverse effects were recorded in this study.<sup><a id="__tag_633156036" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B22">22</a></sup></span></p>

These animal and human <em>ex vivo</em> studies have been reviewed extensively elsewhere, but studies with pure CBD are still lacking. Often combinations of THC and CBD were used. It would be especially interesting to study when CBD is proinflammatory and under which circumstances it is anti-inflammatory and whether this leads to side effects (Burstein, 2015: <a class="fig-table-link figpopup" style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/table/T1/" target="table">Table 1</a> shows a summary of its anti-inflammatory actions; McAllister et al. give an extensive overview in <a class="fig-table-link figpopup" style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/table/T1/" target="table">Table 1</a> of the interplay between CBD anticancer effects and inflammation signaling).<sup><a id="__tag_633155993" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B29">29</a>,<a id="__tag_633156030" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B30">30</a></sup></span></p>

This led to amelioration of learning effects in a pharmacological model of AD. The chronic study we want to describe in more detail here used a transgenic mouse model of AD, where 2.5-month-old mice were treated with either placebo or daily oral CBD doses of 20 mg/kg for 8 months (mice are relatively old at this point). CBD was able to prevent the development of a social recognition deficit in the AD transgenic mice.</span></p>

Using statistical analysis by analysis of variance, this was shown to be only a trend. This might have been caused by the high variation in the transgenic mouse group, though. Also, CBD increased cholesterol levels in WT mice but not in CBD-treated transgenic mice. This was probably due to already elevated cholesterol in the transgenic mice. The study observed no side effects.<sup><a id="__tag_633156039" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B31">31</a> and references within</sup></span></p>

After CBD treatment was stopped, observation continued until the mice were 24 weeks old. CBD treatment lead to considerable reduction of diabetes development (32% developed glucosuria in the CBD group compared to 100% in untreated controls) and to more intact islet of Langerhans cells. CBD increased IL-10 levels, which is thought to act as an anti-inflammatory cytokine in this context.

<p id="__p57" class="p p-first"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">CBD can inhibit CYP2D6, which is also targeted by omeprazole and risperidone.<sup><a class=" bibr popnode" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B2">2</a>,<a class=" bibr popnode" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B14">14</a></sup> There are also indications that CBD inhibits the hepatic enzyme CYP2C9, reducing the metabolization of warfarin and diclofenac.<sup><a class=" bibr popnode" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B2">2</a>,<a class=" bibr popnode" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B14">14</a></sup> More clinical studies are needed, to check whether this interaction warrants an adaption of the used doses of the coadministered drugs.</span></p>
<p id="__p58"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The antibiotic rifampicin induces CYP3A4, leading to reduced CBD peak plasma concentrations.<sup><a class=" bibr popnode" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B14">14</a></sup> In contrast, the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, an antifungal drug, almost doubles CBD peak plasma concentration. Interestingly, the CYP2C19 inhibitor omeprazole, used to treat gastroesophageal reflux, could not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of CBD.<sup><a class=" bibr popnode" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B14">14</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="__p59"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A study, where a regimen of 6×100 mg CBD daily was coadministered with hexobarbital in 10 subjects, found that CBD increased the bioavailability and elimination half-time of the latter. Unfortunately, it was not mentioned whether this effect was mediated via the cytochrome P450 complex.<sup><a id="__tag_633422233" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B16">16</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="__p60"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Another aspect, which has not been thoroughly looked at, to our knowledge, is that several cytochrome isozymes are not only expressed in the liver but also in the brain. It might be interesting to research organ-specific differences in the level of CBD inhibition of various isozymes. Apart from altering the bioavailability in the overall plasma of the patient, this interaction might alter therapeutic outcomes on another level. Dopamine and tyramine are metabolized by CYP2D6, and neurosteroid metabolism also occurs via the isozymes of the CYP3A subgroup.<sup><a class=" bibr popnode" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B50">50</a>,<a id="__tag_633156023" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B51">51</a></sup> Studying CBD interaction with neurovascular cytochrome P450 enzymes might also offer new mechanisms of action. It could be possible that CBD-mediated CYP2D6 inhibition increases dopamine levels in the brain, which could help to explain the positive CBD effects in addiction/withdrawal scenarios and might support its 5HT (=serotonin) elevating effect in depression.</span></p>

<p id="__p62" class="p p-first"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, CBD was coadministered with intravenous fentanyl to a total of 17 subjects.<sup><a id="__tag_633422229" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B10">10</a></sup>Blood samples were obtained before and after 400 mg CBD (previously demonstrated to decrease blood flow to (para)limbic areas related to drug craving) or 800 mg CBD pretreatment. This was followed by a single 0.5 (Session 1) or 1.0μg/kg (Session 2, after 1 week of first administration to allow for sufficient drug washout) intravenous fentanyl dose. Adverse effects and safety were evaluated with both forms of the Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE). This extensive tool tests, for example, 78 adverse effects divided into 23 categories corresponding to organ systems or body parts. The SAFTEE outcomes were similar between groups. No respiratory depression or cardiovascular complications were recorded during any test session.</span></p>
<p id="__p63"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The results of the evaluation of pharmacokinetics, to see if interaction between the drugs occurred, were as follows. Peak CBD plasma concentrations of the 400 and 800 mg group were measured after 4 h in the first session (CBD administration 2 h after light breakfast). Peak urinary CBD and its metabolite concentrations occurred after 6 h in the low CBD group and after 4 h in the high CBD group. No effect was evident for urinary CBD and metabolite excretion except at the higher fentanyl dose, in which CBD clearance was reduced. Importantly, fentanyl coadministration did not produce respiratory depression or cardiovascular complications during the test sessions and CBD did not potentiate fentanyl&#8217;s effects. No correlation was found between CBD dose and plasma cortisol levels.</span></p>
<p id="__p64"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Various vital signs were also measured (blood pressure, respiratory/heart rate, oxygen saturation, EKG, respiratory function): CBD did not worsen the adverse effects (e.g., cardiovascular compromise, respiratory depression) of iv fentanyl. Coadministration was safe and well tolerated, paving the way to use CBD as a potential treatment for opioid addiction. The validated subjective measures scales Anxiety (visual analog scale [VAS]), PANAS (positive and negative subscores), and OVAS (specific opiate VAS) were administered across eight time points for each session without any significant main effects for CBD for any of the subjective effects on mood.<sup><a id="__tag_633422234" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B10">10</a></sup></span></p>

At day 7, the anxiety levels for placebo and CBD group did not differ. CBD did not increase depression (in contract to the selective CB1 antagonist rimonabant). CBD might weaken the attentional bias to smoking cues or could have disrupted reconsolidation, thereby destabilizing drug-related memories.<sup><a id="__tag_633422239" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B59">59</a></sup></span></p>

This was the case for three patients in the CBD group and five patients in the amisulpride group. While both treatments were effective (no significant difference in PANSS total score), CBD showed the better side effect profile. Amisulpride, working as a dopamine D2/D3-receptor antagonist, is one of the most effective treatment options for schizophrenia. CBD treatment was accompanied by a substantial increase in serum anandamide levels, which was significantly associated with clinical improvement, suggesting inhibition of anandamide deactivation via reduced FAAH activity.</span></p>

<p id="__p97"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">After extensive literature study of the available trials performed until September 2016, CBD side effects were generally mild and infrequent. The only exception seems to be a multicenter open-label study with a total of 162 patients aged 1–30 years, with treatment-resistant epilepsy. Subjects were treated for 1 year with a maximum of 25 mg/kg (in some clinics 50 mg/kg) oral CBD, in addition to their standard medication.</span></p>
<p id="__p98" class="p p-last"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This led to a reduction in seizure frequency. In this study, 79% of the cohort experienced side effects. The three most common adverse effects were somnolence (<em>n</em>=41 [25%]), decreased appetite (<em>n</em>=31 [19%]), and diarrhea (<em>n</em>=31 [19%]).<sup><a id="__tag_633156033" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B72">72</a></sup> It has to be pointed out that no control group existed in this study (e.g., placebo or another drug). It is therefore difficult to put the side effect frequency into perspective. Attributing the side effects to CBD is also not straightforward in severely sick patients. Thus, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions on the causation of the observed side effects in this study.</span></p>

This rating instrument comprised the following factors: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort. For the factor, “activities of daily living,” a possible dose-dependent relationship could exist between the low and high CBD group—the two CBD groups scored significantly different here. Side effects were evaluated with the UKU (Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser). This assessment instrument analyzes adverse medication effects, including psychic, neurologic, autonomic, and other manifestations. Using the UKU and verbal reports, no significant side effects were recognized in any of the CBD groups.<sup><a id="__tag_633155991" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B73">73</a></sup></span></p>

The occurrence of various degrees of GVHD was compared with historical data from 108 patients, who had only received the standard treatment. Patients treated with CBD did not develop acute GVHD. In the 16 months after transplantation, the incidence of GHVD was significantly reduced in the CBD group. Side effects were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0) classification, which did not detect severe adverse effects.<sup><a id="__tag_633156002" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B74">74</a></sup></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Endocrine and glycemic (including appetite, weight gain) effects</span></h3>
<p id="__p102" class="p p-first"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study with 62 subjects with noninsulin-treated type 2 diabetes, 13 patients were treated with twice-daily oral doses of 100 mg CBD for 13 weeks. This resulted in lower resistin levels compared to baseline. The hormone resistin is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Compared to baseline, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide levels were elevated after CBD treatment. This incretin hormone is produced in the proximal duodenum by K cells and has insulinotropic and pancreatic b cell preserving effects. CBD was well tolerated in the patients. However, with the comparatively low CBD concentrations used in this phase-2-trial, no overall improvement of glycemic control was observed.<sup><a id="__tag_633155968" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B40">40</a></sup></span></p>

For instance, the study mentioned above, where 23 children with Dravet syndrome were treated, increases as well as decreases in appetite and weight were observed as side effects.<sup><a class=" bibr popnode" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B2">2</a></sup> An open-label trial with 214 patients suffering from treatment-resistant epilepsy showed decreased appetite in 32 cases.

<p id="__p104" class="p p-first"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This review could substantiate and expand the findings of Bergamaschi et al. about CBD favorable safety profile.<sup><a id="__tag_633155981" class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" style="color: #0000ff" role="button" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/#B1">1</a></sup>Nonetheless, various areas of CBD research should be extended. First, more studies researching CBD side effects after real chronic administration need to be conducted. Many so-called chronic administration studies, cited here were only a couple of weeks long. Second, many trials were conducted with a small number of individuals only. To perform a throrough general safety evaluation, more individuals have to be recruited into future clinical trials. Third, several aspects of a toxicological evaluation of a compound such as genotoxicity studies and research evaluating CBD effect on hormones are still scarce. Especially, chronic studies on CBD effect on, for example, genotoxicity and the immune system are still missing. Last, studies that evaluate whether CBD-drug interactions occur in clinical trials have to be performed.</span></p>
<p id="__p105" class="p p-last"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In conclusion, CBD safety profile is already established in a plethora of ways. However, some knowledge gaps detailed above should be closed by additional clinical trials to have a completely well-tested pharmaceutical compound.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">So I thought I should just check if this was involved in pregnancy and gestation.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">PPARγ is known to be a very important transcription factor in metabolic regulation and is also the master regulator of the adipogenic differentiation pathway.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It also plays a key role in the reproductive tract with actions on the corpus luteum and developing gametes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It has been documented in a rich literature to have a major effect on developing embryos and the reproductive tract 9-32.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The Oregon Health Authority also issued this month a baseline report titled <em>Marijuana Report: Use, Attitudes, and Health Effects in Oregon</em>. This comprehensive report includes several key findings.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">  </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Pictured above, for example, is a state map showing the 40 cities and 11 counties that have banned marijuana businesses within their boundaries. However, the Oregon Medical Marijuana Dispensary Program shows those numbers to be higher. Some 80 of the state’s 242 cities and 17 of its 36 counties have banned marijuana processing businesses and marijuana dispensaries from conducting business within their boundaries.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">  </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Oregon legalized marijuana for medical use in 1998 and for recreational use in 2014. Possession of up to eight ounces became legal for those age 21 or older July 1, 2015. Because recreational dispensaries will not open until late this year, the state allowed dispensaries selling pot for medical use to begin selling pot for recreational use as well October 1, 2015.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">  </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> In just three months, however, some changes are already being seen. Marijuana-related calls to the state’s Poison Control Center increased in the last half of 2015, for example, from 105 in 2014 to 158 in 2015.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">  </span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Other data include:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">One in ten 8th-graders and one in five 11th-graders used marijuana in the past month, about the same as national levels.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Approximately 90% of marijuana users smoke the drug.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Some 62% of 11th-graders report marijuana is easy to get, some say easier than cigarettes.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Nearly half of current marijuana using 11th-graders who drive say they drove within three hours of using the drug.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Half (51%) of Oregon adults have seen marijuana store or product advertising, but less than one-third (29%) have seen information about marijuana health effects.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Nearly two-thirds (63%) of Oregon adults say they don’t know when it is legal to drive after using marijuana.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif">RUNGROJ YONGRIT/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">By <span class="author">Alison George</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Cannabis is in the headlines for its potential medical benefits after the recent confiscation of <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2171983-time-to-end-the-cruel-ban-on-using-cannabis-therapy-for-epilepsy/">cannabis oil medication from the mother of a 12-year-old British boy with severe epilepsy</a>. The furore that ensued is shining a light on campaigns for cannabis oils to be made legal for medical reasons, and the UK government has now announced a review into the use of medicinal cannabis. Here’s what you need to know.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>What is cannabis oil?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Cannabis oil is extracted from the cannabis plant <em>Cannabis sativa</em>. The plants medicinal properties have been touted for more than 3,000 years. It was described in the ancient Eygyptian Ebers papyrus around 1550BC, and it was likely used as a medicine in China before that. Some varieties of the plant contain high levels of the psychoactive substance tetrahydrocannabinol (<a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130257-a-little-cannabis-every-day-might-keep-brain-ageing-at-bay/">THC</a>), which is responsible for the “high” that comes from smoking or eating cannabis leaves or resin. The plant’s other major chemical component is <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730354-500-e-spliff-on-sale-in-uk-designed-to-relieve-pain-minus-the-high/">cannabidiol</a>, which has no psychoactive effect. Both act on the body’s natural cannabinoid receptors which are involved in many processes such as memory, pain and appetite. The cannabis plant also contains more than 100 other different cannabinoid compounds at lower concentrations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>So can cannabis oil make you high?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It depends on the THC content. Some types of <em>Cannabis sativa</em> plant, known as hemp, contain very little THC. The extracts from these plants contain mainly cannabidiol, so will not get anyone stoned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Is it legal?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">That’s a complicated question. In the UK cannabidiol is legal. Cannabis plant extracts (known as hemp or CBD oils) are available in high-street stores but the THC content must be below 0.2 per cent. “THC is not psychoactive at this level,” says <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18099-david-nutt-governments-should-get-real-on-drugs/">David Nutt</a>, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Imperial College London. But cannabidiol is illegal in many other countries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In the USA for example, <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://eu.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2018/05/04/court-rules-cbd-cannabidiol-schedule-1-controlled-substance-marijuana-pot/580835002/">cannabidiol is classed as a schedule 1 controlled substance</a>, and can only be sold in states where cannabis use is legal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">However, the tide may turn in favour of cannabidiol after a recent <a style="color: #0000ff" href="http://www.who.int/medicines/access/controlled-substances/5.2_CBD.pdf">World Health Organisation review</a>. This concluded that cannabidiol “exhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or dependence potential” but “has been demonstrated as an effective treatment of epilepsy … and may be a useful treatment for a number of other medical conditions.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>What is the evidence that cannabis oils can help treat epilepsy?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Although there is some scientific evidence <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604191/">that THC has potential to control convulsions</a>, its mind-altering effects mean that much of the focus has turned to cannabidiol – particularly for childhood epilepsies that conventional drugs fail to control.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Two recent high quality randomised and placebo controlled trials showed that cannabidiol is an <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)30136-3/fulltext">effective treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome</a> and <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5716495/">Dravet syndrome</a>, severe forms of epilepsy. The mechanism of action is unknown, but it may be <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.gwpharm.com/products-pipeline/research-trials/mechanism-action">due to a combination of effects</a>, such as inhibiting the activity of neurons and dampening inflammation in the brain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The situation is less clear when it comes to the use of commercial cannabis oils to control seizures, where the evidence is mainly anecdotal, and the oils can contain differing concentrations of cannabidiol and THC.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The UK government announced on 19 June that <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23831833-300-uk-government-to-review-medicinal-cannabis-laws/">it would review the use of medical cannabis</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Are there any cannabis-based epilepsy drugs on the market?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Not yet. In April the US Food and Drug Administration recommended the approval of a drug called Epidiolex for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. Its active ingredient is cannabidiol, and final approval is due at the end of this month.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">However, it is possible the drug is not as effective as cannabis oil containing THC, says Nutt. For example, the cannabis oil used to treat Billy Caldwell, the boy at the centre of the recent cannabis oil confiscation furore, contained cannabidiol and a low dose of THC, because cannabidiol alone did not stop all his seizures.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This is one of the big unknowns. “It is important to remember that there is currently very little scientific evidence to support cannabis oil containing both THC and cannabidiol as a treatment for epilepsy,” said the charity Epilepsy Action, in a <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/involved/campaigns/cannabis">statement issued this month</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>Are cannabis-based medications available for other conditions?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Yes. A synthetic version of THC called Nabilone has been used since the 1980s to treat nausea after chemotherapy and to help people put on weight. A drug called Sativex is also <a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20367-cannabis-based-drug-gets-green-light-worldwide/">approved for the treatment of pain</a> and spasms associated with multiple sclerosis. It contains an equal mix of THC and cannabidiol, but would not be suitable for the treatment of children with epilepsy such as Billy. “If you used that to treat epilepsy, the kids would be stoned off their heads,” says Nutt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>What is the aim of the UK government’s review of medical cannabis? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The first part of the review will look at the evidence for the therapeutic value of cannabis-based products. It can recommend any promising ones for the second part of the review. This will be carried out by the government’s Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs, which can recommend a change to the legal medical status of cannabis and cannabinoids.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This will hopefully lead to a relaxation of the rules surrounding research into cannabis-based medicines says Tom Freeman, a clinical psychopharmacologist at King’s College London.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In the UK cannabis currently has Schedule 1 status, the most restrictive category, which is for drugs which are not used medicinally such as LSD. “This creates a Catch 22 situation,” says Freeman. “You can’t show that cannabis and cannabis-based products have medicinal value because of restrictions on medical research.”  If cannabis is moved to the Schedule 2 category, it will join substances such as morphine and diamorphine (heroin) which can be prescribed by doctors if there is a clinical need. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">As support for decriminalising and legalising marijuana is growing, several new studies highlight the potentially harmful effects of the drug on its user’s brain and heart. The findings are particularly revealing in the field of recreational cannabis use. While studying the brains of a group of twenty occasional cannabis smokers, researchers from Harvard University found that as few as one or two uses a week can change the brain. Smoking marijuana was found to primarily affect the areas involved in decision making, emotions and motivations. Along the same lines, a group of French researchers found that marijuana use ups the risk of developing heart problems (i.e. strokes, heart attacks and circulation problems). More research is needed to better understand the health risks associated with marijuana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Much research on normative misconceptions among university students has been published in North America, but much less has surfaced in Europe. This cross-sectional study is based on 12 classes of second-year French college students in sociology, medicine, nursing or foreign language. Rather than focus on one substance the students were asked to estimate the proportion of tobacco, cannabis, alcohol use and heavy episodic drinking among their peers and to report their own use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Researchers found that that substance use patterns and perceptions of the norms differ significantly across academic disciplines and that substance users are more likely to misjudge real peer use prevalence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">They conclude that social norms of substance use are an important factor among students personal use. Overestimating these norms is associated with increased levels of use. In addition to other strategies, the researchers recommend that prevention programs should consider changing use perception when it is overestimated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;These results show that there are grounds for university level prevention campaigns based on local survey results.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">Communities that emphasize and encourage drug-free workplace practices can have an impact on overall drug use in the community. When combined with effective education and prevention, and by increasing the incentive of users to seek treatment, we can promote a drug-free culture and a thriving business environment that protects individuals, families and the community.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">While some might think they don’t need a drug-free workplace policy, <a href="http://sober-work-place.com/workplace/why-celebrate-drug-free-work-week/">as we discussed last week</a>, that’s really not true. Small businesses, not just large companies, need firm drug testing policies.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">One new form of marijuana that’s growing in popularity nationwide underscores the need for workplace drug testing programs. This dangerous drug, wax marijuana, can easily be used in the workplace because it doesn’t look like regular marijuana — and frighteningly, it’s the most powerful form of the drug.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">Here’s what employers need to know about wax marijuana, and why it shows the need to participate in Drug Free Work Week.</span></span></p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">The 411 on Wax Marijuana – and What it Means for Drug Free Workplace Programs</span></span></h1>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">With aliases like butter and honeycomb because of its waxy texture, wax is the most powerful form of marijuana.</span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">According to wax marijuana users, a single hit can leave a high lasting all day. One dosage is equal to 20 marijuana cigarettes and can produce powerful hallucinations and psychotic effects. This potency is because wax marijuana is more than 80% pure THC.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">Manufacturers produce wax by extracting the main psychoactive compound, Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), from marijuana. They use flammable substances like butane in the process, which makes it quite dangerous, but renders the wax marijuana very strong.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">While wax marijuana is legal in states like Colorado and Washington, it’s illegal under federal law and in most states.</span></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">Employers should take note – due to its appearance, wax marijuana can be passed off as lip balm.</span></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">This means that your employees could bring the most powerful form of marijuana into the workplace and use it right under your nose.</span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">Remember, any on-the-clock substance abuse has lasting effects on your workplace, particularly when it comes to the safety of your employees. Just one hit of wax marijuana can result in an extremely powerful, daylong high — rendering your worker a serious danger to everyone around them.</span></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">Your workplace needs a drug testing policy to combat new trends in substance use, like wax marijuana.</span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">Drug Free Work Week is a great opportunity for you to take stock of your existing drug testing policy or create a new workplace drug testing program. If you don’t take the time now to create or revise a policy, you may pay for it down the line as your employees try new drugs, such as wax marijuana, and end up causing injuries or financial damage to your workplace.</span></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;color: #0000ff">Partner With ARCpoint Labs for Workplace Drug Testing Policies.</span></span></h2>

These inappropriate corrections overpowered the marijuana effect. We&#8217;re glad the corrections have been made.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Earlier this month Germany celebrated the results of the 2014 drug report which revealed a rapid decline in smoking, drinking and marijuana use among youth over the past ten years. Smoking among German teens aged 12 – 17 has halved in ten years (11.7%). Smoking rates have also dropped among 18 – 25 year olds, not as significantly though. Drinking rates have fallen from 17.9% in 2001 to 13.6% in 2012 among 12 – 17 year olds. In terms of gender differences, teenage boys are twice more likely to consume alcohol than their female counterparts. Little has changed among 18 – 25 year olds, the group that accounts for the highest alcohol consumption rate. Drinking in that age group was reported at 38.4% in 2012 which means it only dropped by a little over 1%. Cannabis ranks first among illicit drugs used with 5.6% of 12 – 17 year old teenagers using it compared to 9.2% in 2001. After years of steady consumption rates, cannabis use among 18 – 25 year olds is on the rise again and at 15.8% resembles figures of 2001.</span></p>

<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Cannabis herb (they make a distinction between herb and resin) seizures in North America account for 64% of worldwide seizures.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">US outdoor eradication rates significantly dropped (6,470 in 2012 from 23, 622 in 2011) but it is unclear if the decrease was due to declining law enforcement activity in that area or to increasing legal grows due to new laws in CO and WA.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In 2012 , between 125 million and 227 million people who estimated to have used cannabis, that corresponds to 2.7 and 4.9% of the population aged 15-64 years.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">We are changing laws to accommodate this small proportion of the population. These laws will have a deleterious knock on effect for the 95% majority of the population.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Over the past 5 years (in N. America, the largest cannabis herb market) prevalence rates in the US have increased but declined in Canada between 2008-2011 and increasing again between 2011-2012.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Cannabis use in the UK is down to the lowest levels since measurements began in 1996….. but the UK Government has not so far relaxed firm drug laws.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In the US, between 2006-2010 there was a 59% increase in cannabis-related ER visits and a 14% increase in cannabis-related treatment admissions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">•   Expert analyses predicts that legalization of cannabis will most likely reduce production costs which would in turn be expected decease prices overtime. Since cannabis consumption responds to prices, the lower prices will likely lead to high consumption. It is estimated that for each 10% drop in price there will be an approx. 3% increase in total users and a 3-5%</span></p>

Extensive debates continue regarding marijuana (Cannabis spp), the most commonly used illicit substance in many countries worldwide. There has been an exponential increase of cannabis studies over the past two decades but the drug’s long-term effects still lack in-depth scientific data. The epigenome is a critical molecular machinery with the capacity to maintain persistent alterations of gene expression and behaviors induced by cannabinoids that have been observed across the individual’s lifespan and even into the subsequent generation. </p>
<p>Though mechanistic investigations regarding the consequences of developmental cannabis exposure remain sparse, human and animal studies have begun to reveal specific epigenetic disruptions in the brain and the periphery. In this article, we focus attention on long-term disturbances in epigenetic regulation in relation to prenatal, adolescent and parental germline cannabinoid exposure. Expanding knowledge about the protracted molecular memory could help to identify novel targets to develop preventive strategies and treatments for behaviors relevant to neuropsychiatric risks associated with developmental cannabis exposure. </p>

		<p><strong>Abstract </strong></p>
<p>Metabolic and behavioural effects of, and interactions between Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are influenced by dose and administration route. </p>
<p> Therefore we investigated, in Wistar rats, effects of pulmonary, oral and subcutaneous (sc.) THC, CBD and THC+CBD. Concentrations of THC, its metabolites 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH, and CBD in serum and brain were determined over 24h, locomotor activity (open field) and sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition, PPI) were also evaluated. </p>
<p> In line with recent knowledge we expected metabolic and behavioural interactions between THC and CBD. While cannabinoid serum and brain levels rapidly peaked and diminished after pulmonary administration, sc. and oral administration produced long-lasting levels of cannabinoids with oral reaching the highest brain levels. </p>
<p> Except pulmonary administration, CBD inhibited THC metabolism resulting in higher serum/brain levels of THC. Importantly, following sc. and oral CBD alone treatments, THC was also detected in serum and brain. S.c. cannabinoids caused hypolocomotion, oral treatments containing THC almost complete immobility.  </p>
<p>In contrast, oral CBD produced mild hyperlocomotion. CBD disrupted, and THC tended to disrupt PPI, however their combination did not. </p>
<p> In conclusion, oral administration yielded the most pronounced behavioural effects which corresponded to the highest brain levels of cannabinoids. Even though CBD potently inhibited THC metabolism after oral and sc. administration, unexpectedly it had minimal impact on THC-induced behaviour.  </p>
<p>Of central importance was the novel finding that THC can be detected in serum and brain after administration of CBD alone which, if confirmed in humans and given the increasing medical use of CBD-only products, might have important legal and forensic ramifications. </p>

		<p><strong>Abstract</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Marijuana is a widely used recreational substance. Few cases have been reported of acute myocardial infarction following marijuana use. To our knowledge, this is the first ever study analyzing the lifetime odds of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with marijuana use and the outcomes in AMI patients with versus without marijuana use. </p>
<p><strong>Methods </strong></p>
<p>We queried the 2010-2014 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database for 11-70-year-old AMI patients. </p>
<p>Pearson Chi-square test for categorical variables and Student T-test for continuous variables were used to compare the baseline demographic and hospital characteristics between two groups (without vs. with marijuana) of AMI patients. The univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess and compare the clinical outcomes between two groups. We used Cochran–Armitage test to measure the trends. All statistical analyses were executed by IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). We used<br />
weighted data to produce national estimates in our study. </p>
<p><strong>Results </strong></p>
<p>Out of 2,451,933 weighted hospitalized AMI patients, 35,771 patients with a history of marijuana and 2,416,162 patients without a history of marijuana use were identified. The AMI-marijuana group consisted more of younger, male, African American patients. The length of stay and mortality rate were lower in the AMI-marijuana group with more patients being discharged against medical advice. </p>
<p>Multivariable analysis showed that marijuana use was a significant risk factor for AMI development when adjusted for age, sex, race (adjusted OR 1.079, 95% CI 1.065-1.093, p&lt;0.001); adjusted for age, female, race, smoking, cocaine abuse (adjusted OR 1.041, 95% CI 1.027-1.054, p&lt;0.001); and also when adjusted for age, female, race, payer status, smoking, cocaine abuse, amphetamine abuse and alcohol abuse (adjusted OR: 1.031, 95% CI: 1.018-1.045, p&lt;0.001). Complications such as respiratory failure (OR 18.9, CI 15.6-23.0, p&lt;0.001), cerebrovascular disease (OR 9.0, CI 7.0-11.7, p&lt;0.001), cardiogenic shock (OR 6.0, CI 4.9-7.4, p&lt;0.001), septicemia (OR 1.8, CI 1.5–2.2, p&lt;0.001), and dysrhythmia (OR 1.8, CI 1.5-2.1, p&lt;0.001) were independent predictors of mortality in AMI-marijuana group. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>The lifetime AMI odds were increased in recreational marijuana users. Overall odds of mortality were not increased significantly in AMI-marijuana group. However, marijuana users showed higher trends of AMI prevalence and related mortality from 2010-2014. It is crucial to assess cardiovascular effects related to marijuana overuse and educate patients for the same. </p>

		<p>Hamilton County Coroner Dr. Lakshmi Kode Sammarco released 2017 drug statistics Tuesday. </p>
<p>Last fall, the coroner said overdoses in Hamilton County had surpassed the total of last year, with 427 suspected deaths – and three months remaining in 2017, making the toll the worst since the heroin epidemic began. in the Tri-State. </p>
<p>Most overdose deaths have been due to fentanyl or chemically similar drugs, Sammarco said. </p>
<p>The county reported 403 overdose deaths in 2016 &#8211; up 30 percent, overdose deaths were totalled at 529 for 2017. </p>
<p>Sammarco described the increasing number of cases as &#8220;scary.&#8221; She said drug prevention efforts can only do so much without the help of the public. </p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t do this alone. Everybody here is busting their butt to try to get a handle on not just the supply, but to get help for the addicts and families. But we need the communities to step up, we need every neighborhood to keep an eye on their neighborhood. To try and help us get the dealers off the street, to try and get help to the addicts. You see something, say something.&#8221; </p>
<p>Sammarco noted the death toll was reduced by Narcan. </p>
<p>&#8220;The number of lives being saved is huge,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt they would&#8217;ve been double or triple what they were without Narcan.&#8221; </p>
<p>The coroner said 30,000 items were turned into the office’s drug section in 2017. Hfour drug analysts each processed well over 7,000 items, which 2.5 times higher than any other lab in Ohio. </p>
<p>Prevention First, a local non-profit aimed at reducing substance abuse released their findings from this year&#8217;s student drug-use survey. </p>
<p>They said of the more than 30,000 students grades 7 through 12 surveyed, nearly 14 percent have admitted to using alcohol in the past 30 days. </p>
<p>Tobacco use was only reported in five percent of students. Marijuana usage was slightly higher at more than eight percent. </p>
<p>Prescription drug abuse was reported in only 2.4 percent of students. </p>
<p>Commissioners said aside from marijuana use, the statistics have been trending downward since 2000. </p>
<p>&#8220;Hats off to Prevention First for leading the charge on that and for providing all of this really important information when it comes to prevention and what young people are doing in this community because this is the tip of the spear,&#8221; Commissioner Denise Driehaus said. </p>
<p>The survey, which is given every two years by Prevention First, was distributed to 80 public and private schools in six southwest Ohio counties. </p>
<p>To try to top overdoses before they happen, the Hamilton County Heroin Coalition is launching a Quick Response Teams early next month, on April 3. </p>
<p>The coalition is uniting with fire departments, law enforcement and social workers to create a team that follows up with overdose victims and offers them same-day addiction treatment. according to a prepared statement.  </p>
<p>Modelled on an effort in Colerain Twp., the team will try to find overdose survivors using a database maintained by the Greater Cincinnati Fusion Center, a public safety data collecting agency. </p>
<p>Heroin Coalition commander and Norwood Police Lt. Tom Fallon told Hamilton County commissioners Monday the database would help locate overdose survivors who are otherwise hard to find. </p>
<p>The team will also use “predictive analysis” to track drug activity to target potential overdoses in with the help of University of Cincinnati’s Institute of Crime Science. </p>
<p>The effort is funded by a $400,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice funded through the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. </p>

		<p>All creatures great and small are being poisoned by the pesticides and rodenticides in the water they drink, and in the food they eat.  This polluted water from northern California marijuana grows eventually flows to much of the State.  The lawless pot industry is nothing less than purveyors of poison.  The recent scientific study “Cultivating Disaster: The Effect of Cannabis Cultivation on the Environment of Calaveras County,” points out that the cultivation of the drug was allowed by the State without adequate understanding of the impact on the environment and public health, welfare and safety. The chemicals that flow from the grow sites to the watershed had never been approved for these crops. </p>
<p>California does not regulate marijuana as a medicine because it is a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance under Federal Law, rather it is classified as an agricultural product.  However, pot growers do not have to meet the same stringent requirements for chemicals and fertilizers as do all other farmers. Though there is limited testing being conducted by local water providers to determine if dangerous chemicals are leaching into water supplies or waste treatment systems, independent water experts testing water samples in Calaveras County found two thirds of the samples contained chemicals proven to be deadly poison to humans, fish and animals.  </p>
<p>Of particular concern is carbofuron, an extremely toxic, water soluble granular pesticide banned in the U.S. but used among Mexican cartels.  It is reported that an eighth of a teaspoon would kill a 300 lb black bear. In 2017, UC Davis researchers found harmful bacteria and deadly mold and Aspergillus fungi on marijuana in grows and dispensaries. This critical threat from marijuana grows to our environment and the human population is just beginning to surface.  </p>
<p>The damaging effects of marijuana (cannabis), often considered a hallucinogenic drug, have long been known. High level THC, the mind-altering chemical in marijuana, is being grown and sold today as a “medicine.”  It is long acting and addictive, causing brain damage, loss of intellect, psychotic breaks, suicides, mental illness, and birth defects and leads to other social costs from higher crime rates, highway deaths, excessive high school dropouts, and increased ER admissions, among others.   </p>
<p>This lawless Big Marijuana Industry follows the playbook of Big Tobacco: GET KIDS HOOKED – ADDICTION OFTEN FOLLOWS.  Their advertisements include images of Santa Claus, kids’ movies and cartoons, and they sell “edibles,” pot infused candy, lollipops and gummy bears with THC levels 50-70%.   Many products are advertised as being 94-95% THC.  Now there is crystalline THC that is 99.99% THC, known as “the strongest weed in the world.”   Unfortunately, the public perception of marijuana is based on marijuana of the past – with 1- 5% THC.   </p>
<p>The Calaveras Study estimates 1200 grows sites in that county; U.S. Forest Service estimates a tag of 2 billion to reclaim these sites.  An estimated 50,000 grow sites in California would cost 50 &#8211; 80 billion to reclaim.  The California Department of Fish and Wildlife says, “We are aware of the seriousness of the problem, but (we) do not know who is going to help clean it up.” </p>
<p>U.S. Attorney General Sessions has indicated his willingness to enforce our federal food and drug and environment laws when it comes to marijuana.  Our California U.S. Attorneys must prosecute those who have broken federal, state, and county ordinances and explore funding to pay for cleanup of the land.  This is not just a California issue, the U.S. Supreme Court </p>
<p>has ruled that federal marijuana laws preempt state laws and that marijuana control is a federal matter, not a states’ rights matter. There is no time to waste. Our future is at stake. </p>

        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Marijuana has always been seen as the laid-back drug. It might make you crave ice cream and chocolate cake or induce you to fall asleep, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t dangerous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Yet, as governments in Britain and Canada consider decriminalizing the drug, medical researchers are warning that smoking cannabis increases the risk of lung disease and, more disturbingly, that its use can exacerbate psychosis and that it is linked with the onset of schizophrenia in adolescents.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">&#8220;We have the evidence of cannabis and its dangers,&#8221; said Dr. Richard Russell, a respiratory specialist and a spokesman for the British Lung Foundation, which published a report this week on the dangers of cannabis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">&#8220;What we really want to avoid is the situation we had in the 1930s, &#8217;40s and &#8217;50s with cigarettes, where doctors were recommending tobacco as being good for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">In its report, the lung foundation warns that cannabis is more harmful to the lungs than tobacco. It says smoking three joints a day can cause the same damage as 20 cigarettes, and tar from marijuana contains 50 per cent more carcinogens than that from tobacco.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Persistent users are risking lung cancer, emphysema, bronchitis and other respiratory illnesses, it says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">One of the major problems is posed by the way users smoke marijuana and hashish: They take puffs that are almost twice as large as those tobacco smokers take and hold the smoke in four times as long. &#8220;This means that there is a greater respiratory burden of carbon monoxide and smoke particulates such as tar than when smoking a similar quantity of tobacco.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">The foundation also noted that in the 1960s, the average marijuana joint contained about 10 milligrams of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which accounts for the drug&#8217;s psychoactive properties. Because of sophisticated cultivation techniques, the average joint today has 150 mg of THC, a 15-fold increase.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Dr. Russell, the respiratory specialist, worries that young people think cannabis is a &#8220;cool drug&#8221; that is risk-free. A survey carried out this year showed that 79 per cent of British children believe cannabis is safe.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">The Canadian government indicated in its Speech from the Throne last month that it is considering the decriminalization of marijuana possession.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Already, it gives exemptions to drug laws to allow sick people to have marijuana. On the other hand, pot grown for medicinal purposes in an abandoned Manitoba mine with Ottawa&#8217;s sanction sits in storage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">In Britain, under a proposal due to become law next year, simple possession of a small amount of cannabis will no longer result in an automatic arrest although police will still be able to go after users in &#8220;aggravated&#8221; circumstances, such as smoking in the presence of children. Cannabis trafficking will also continue to bring a prison sentence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Meanwhile, clinical studies on the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes are under way with HIV patients in Canada and with people suffering from multiple sclerosis in Britain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">The British Lung Foundation says it is not trying to get involved in the debate over whether cannabis should be legalized, leaving that to politicians. &#8220;Our report is not about the moral rights and wrongs of cannabis, but simply making sure everyone is completely clear about the respiratory health risks involved,&#8221; said Dr. Mark Britton, chairman of the foundation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Dr. Russell says he recently saw a 40-year-old patient in his clinic with &#8220;severe end-stage emphysema&#8221; and has about 18 months to live. The patient has been smoking three joints a day for the past 25 years, the equivalent of smoking 60 cigarettes a day from the age of 15, he says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Studies of heavy cannabis smoking among Rastafarians in the Caribbean have also pointed to increased danger of early lung cancer, Dr. Russell says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Les Iversen, a professor of pharmacology at King&#8217;s College in London and an expert on cannabis, agrees that smoking marijuana poses dangers, but he says the report&#8217;s findings are exaggerated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">There is no specific evidence linking cannabis smoking with lung cancer, Prof. Iversen says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">He says it&#8217;s absurd to say smoking three joints is equivalent to smoking 20 cigarettes because joints come in different sizes and strengths as do commercial cigarettes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Although he adds, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think any drug is safe.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Psychiatrists have also linked cannabis use to schizophrenia.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">&#8220;People with schizophrenia do not take more alcohol, heroin or ecstasy than the rest of us, but they are twice as likely to smoke cannabis regularly,&#8221; says Dr. Robin Murray, a professor of psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry in London.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Dr. Murray says cannabis, along with cocaine and amphetamines, encourage the release of dopamine in the brain, which in turn leads to increased hallucinations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">He notes that the incidence of schizophrenia in south London has doubled in the past 40 years, and he says increased use of both cannabis and cocaine could be at fault.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Dr. Murray cites a study that interviewed 50,000 conscripts to the Swedish Army about their drug use and followed up later. Heavy users of cannabis at the age of 18 were six times as likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia by the time they were 33 than those who kept away from the drug.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Another study, this one in the Netherlands, interviewed 7,500 people about their consumption of drugs and looked at their behaviour over the next three years. Regular users of cannabis were more likely to develop psychosis than those who did not use the drug.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">&#8220;Any public debate on cannabis needs to take account of the risks as well as the pleasure,&#8221; Dr. Murray says. &#8220;Pro-marijuana campaigners claim, extrapolating from their Saturday-night joint, that cannabis is totally safe. Yet they would be unlikely to claim that a bottle of vodka a day is healthy on the basis of sharing a bottle of Chablis over dinner.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">&#8220;No drugs that alter brain chemistry are totally safe,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Just as some who drink heavily become alcoholic, so a minority of those who smoke cannabis daily go psychotic.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">A major study on the links between cannabis and schizophrenia is due to be published in the British Medical Journal next week by Louise Arsenault, a biomedical researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry who was trained at the University of Montreal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Research made public last year by Dr. Arsenault showed that young men who regularly smoke cannabis are five times more likely to be violent than those who avoid the drug. Using data from a study of 961 young adults in Dunedin, New Zealand, she discovered that one-third of those with a cannabis habit had a court conviction for violence by the time they hit 21 or had displayed violent behaviour. That was three times the level of those who drank excessive amounts of alcohol.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">The warnings about marijuana have not deterred members of Britain&#8217;s Legalize Cannabis Alliance, who say the report is merely a selective study of existing medical literature, which ignores studies that discount the health threats posed by the drug.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">&#8220;I&#8217;ve used it for 30 years and it doesn&#8217;t seem to have affected my health,&#8221; says Alun Buffry, the alliance&#8217;s national co-ordinator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">&#8220;I stopped tobacco three or four years ago and I have noticed that since then my health has improved. My general level of energy has improved and I get more of a high from cannabis than the sleepiness I used to get, which I think had to do with tobacco.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">Mr. Buffry argues that it would be best to legalize cannabis to control the quality of what is sold and eliminate &#8220;dirty supplies&#8221; that may include potentially harmful glues, fillers and colouring agents.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff">&#8220;I would argue that it would be far more dangerous illegal than it would be legalized,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Even if cannabis were the most dangerous substance in the world, it is still consumed by millions of people.&#8221;</span></p>

He previously worked on research, policy and speech writing at ONDCP in 2000 and from 2003-2004 in the Clinton and Bush Administrations, respectively.

He studied philosophy at Williams College (B.A.) and the University of Texas (Ph.D.) and earned a law degree from Harvard.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Bennett, along with former prosecutor Robert White, recently penned an op-ed piece for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> calling marijuana a <a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/marijuana-bill-introduced-change-drugs-classification">public health menace</a>. The two are also finishing a book about marijuana legalization which is due out in February 2015.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Bennett frequently features on his radio show guests warning of the dangers of marijuana legalization. He is concerned that while the science shows that legalizing marijuana is not beneficial, <a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/marijuana-legalization-gets-big-boost-california">public opinion is going in the other direction</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">His organization seeks a third way to address the drug problem, one that “neither legalizes or demonizes marijuana.” <a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/doing-math-drug-war">Kennedy does not think incarceration is the answer</a>. He wants to make small amounts a civil offense. He emphasizes his belief that public health officials need to be heeded on this issue and they are not.

It shines the light, <a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/does-marijuana-induce-psychosis">especially on the perils of marijuana for adolescents</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Recently Califano released an updated edition of his book <em>How to Raise a Drug-Free Kid: The Straight Dope for Parents</em>. He believes an update was needed because of the advances in science regarding youth and substance abuse that have occurred during the past five years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">He zeroes in on marijuana in the book, which he says is more potent today than it was 30 or 40 years ago. He points out &#8211; during an interview about the book published on the CASAColumbia website &#8211; the hazards of “synthetic marijuana” also known as Spice or K2. He says this is available in convenient stores and gas stations but is so lethal it was banned in New Hampshire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Califano stresses that parents are the bulwark against substance abuse and addiction. He cited data during the interview that “70% of college students say their parents’ concerns or expectations influence whether or how much they drink, smoke or use drugs. Parental disapproval of such conduct is key to kids getting through the college years drug free. This is the time for you to use social media to keep in touch with your kids.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">He makes the analogy that “sending your children to college without coaching them about how to deal with drugs and alcohol is like giving them the keys to the car without teaching them how to drive.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">About ASAM’s attitudes toward marijuana, he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“Our positions and policies with respect to marijuana have been developed over many decades and have been updated based upon the latest scientific evidence.

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">That said, he believes anecdotal evidence supports that more research should be conducted to deduce which parts of the marijuana plan can have<a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/medical-marijuana-stock-and-beyond-cara-therapeutics-ceo-explains">medical value</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Why did he get involved in this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“I didn’t get involved in this as a &#8220;crusader&#8221; or because of a specific interest, but rather because I serve as the spokesperson for ASAM,” he told MainStreet.com. “In fact, though, given that there is so much industry-sourced money financing the marijuana proponents, and that the science-based opposition has little funding at all, I recognize the need for the public to actually hear what the facts are, particularly given the media bias and conflict of interest in terms of being motivated by potential ad revenue.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, Washington D.C., Murray co-directs the Center for Substance Abuse Policy Research. While serving previous posts as chief scientist and associate deputy director for supply reduction in the federal government’s Office of National Drug Control Policy. Before entering government, Murray, who holds an M.A. and Ph.D. in social anthropology from the University of Chicago, was executive director of the Statistical Assessment Service and held academic appointments at Connecticut College, Brown, Brandeis and Georgetown Universities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">What motivated him to get involved in a campaign to oppose marijuana legalization?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“It results from a steady regress from encountering a host of social pathologies (homelessness, failed school performance, domestic violence, child neglect, poverty, early crime, despair and suicide) and then time and again stumbling over a common denominator that either was a trigger or an accelerator of that pathology &#8211; substance abuse,” Murray told <em>MainStreet</em>. “Yet one finds as a dispassionate social analyst that the matter is either discounted, or overlooked, or not given sufficient weight, in the efforts to remediate the other surface manifestation pathologies,” he continued. “Moreover, one keeps encountering a sense that there is a closet with a door that is shut and it holds behind the door a host of explanations or guides to understanding of our woes, yet few are willing to open that door and address what lies behind it.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">He notes that even those who acknowledge the impact of substance abuse across so many maladies seem to not approach the problem with an open and searching mind. He said often one finds a ready-made narrative that serves to explain away the impact. The more that narrative is refuted “with counter argument or robust data indicating otherwise” the more social analysts resist or are in denial about the inadequacy of the standard narrative.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Subsequently, people who do criticize this encounter pressure from peers essentially telling to accept the narrative or shut up.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">He mentions a good specific example can be found by encountering the reaction to the “gateway hypothesis” regarding early marijuana exposure. The literature in support of the gateway is quite strong he says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“Yet everywhere the dominant response is to evade the implications,” he points out. “Our analysts pose alternative and unlikely accountings that seem practically Ptolemaic in their complicated denial of the obviously more simple and more real mechanism: exposure to the drug does, in fact, increase the likelihood of developing dependency on other, &#8216;harder&#8217; drugs in a measurable way.“</span></p>

But then he picked up a really habitual marijuana smoking practice. He smoked, probably, daily. This was the mid to late &#8217;80s. And to this day, I believe he is still a smoker&#8230;.and he is a waste-case.

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A former state and federal prosecutor, Stiles supervised the Organized Crime/Drug Enforcement Task Force – a group of agents and prosecutors who investigate and prosecute high-level drug trafficking organizations, including Los Angeles street gangs, Mexican cartels and international drug smuggling and money laundering operations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">One of his proudest personal and career achievements was the organization and implementation of the statewide “Enough is Enough” anti-drug campaign which produced community coalitions in every area of Idaho. In addition to the prosecution of drug traffickers, Monte has been a passionate drug educator and motivational speaker for schools, businesses, churches, law enforcement agencies, and other youth and parent organizations. He left government service in April 2011 to devote all of his time to drug education, other motivational speaking and nature photography.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">I was recently moderating several nights of focus groups in Denver when the subject of marijuana suddenly and unexpectedly broke into the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">At the beginning of each group I asked respondents to introduce themselves, stating their favorite hobbies or leisure time interests, and one thing they would change about Colorado. I’ve been doing this for decades and am used to hearing “the usual suspects” when it comes to what respondents want to change. Fix the traffic. Improve the schools. Stop the influx of new residents, particularly those from California and Texas. I even got a few mentions of the oddly standard, “I wish we had an ocean and a beach.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But this time, in every group, someone mentioned he or she would go back on the state’s wholesale legalization of marijuana. I probed Coloradans some on the topic this trip, and the buyers’ remorse is palpable. People didn’t really know what they were getting into.</span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">I wrote about the possibility of second thoughts on marijuana previously, in early April; ordinarily I wouldn’t circle back so quickly, but I am seeing too much evidence to ignore the growing backlash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It’s not just ordinary voters who now are second-guessing the move. Leaders are wondering aloud whether they should have done more to fight against approval of the referendum. Colorado’s mainstream civic elite, which ordinarily and routinely organizes large coalitions to fight ballot measures it deems bad for the state, generally chose to stand aside during the two referenda — one on medical marijuana and the other on leisure use — leaving the opposition to movement to conservative groups alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The problem with new policies enacted through the referendum process is that there are always unintended consequences. I spotted one on this last trip to Mile High country. Some voters now think that the marijuana trade, and the associated tax revenue, is such a financial bonanza that it should pay for most everything. It’s going to be a lot harder to pass any increases in general sales or property taxes because voters will instead want pot tax dollars to carry the burden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It may be only a statistical margin of error quirk, but looking at the latest CBS News polling on marijuana legalization, I am wondering if there is a larger doubting of the wisdom of legalization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">For the first time in any time series I’ve monitored, support for legalization actually declined in mid-May’s CBS poll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">CBS found that just 48 percent of Americans believe marijuana should be legal, down from 51 percent in two earlier polls taken by CBS in January and February. Given that each study interviewed samples of approximately 1,000 adults, for a 3 percent margin of error, a 4-point drop in legalization support is just outside the margin — and more importantly, it’s a rare drop of any magnitude in momentum for legalization. For more than a decade, every successive poll saw rising support for marijuana. The latest CBS numbers are a throwback to a poll the organization took in 2012. That’s a serious regression for marijuana advocates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Pot’s regress since January in the CBS polling is most noteworthy among the middle-aged (45-64) population (-13 percentage points in support for legalization) and by liberals (-9 points in support). Frankly, I am not at all surprised by the latter. Overall, support by liberals still stands at a stout 63 percent, but if I had deeper crosstabs, I’d expect that some green liberals with children under the age of 18 are starting to have some reservations about pot, just as many do about tobacco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Pollsters will be keeping a close watch on these numbers. Is the trend in rising support for marijuana reaching a ceiling? Could there even be a growing pushback? Could the backlash be more about health and air quality than about conservative ideology? </span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">For decades, attorney Richard Blau focused his legal savvy on the high-stakes business of booze. Alcohol-industry law was an attorney&#8217;s dream, full of unresolved questions and deep-pocketed players clawing their way to the top.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> So when Florida&#8217;s talk turned to marijuana, another storied pastime with its own dubious history, Blau&#8217;s titan of a law firm, GrayRobinson, jumped at the opportunity. Blau now leads a special practice for clients wanting to capitalize on medical cannabis — and bend the laws to their advantage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> &#8220;The playbook is to get in and lend a hand in crafting those rules, so they read the way our clients want them to read,&#8221; Blau said. &#8220;The powerful people are the ones to get in on the ground floor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Months before the state&#8217;s November vote to legalize medical marijuana, some of Florida&#8217;s biggest law firms are already staking their claims to the lucrative legal minefield of the budding weed industry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Orlando-based GrayRobinson, which employs 101 attorneys in Tampa Bay and nearly 300 across the state, will devote a core of its &#8220;regulated products&#8221; group to the nuances of marijuana law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Attorneys with Holland &amp; Knight, a prominent firm in Tampa with more than 1,000 lawyers across the world, last week released an alert for clients on the &#8220;legal landscape (and) complex marketplace for marijuana-related businesses.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> And Akerman, the Miami-based corporate-law giant and largest law firm in the state, recently launched a &#8220;regulated substances task force&#8221; with nearly two dozen senior attorneys and public-policy professionals ready to advise, among others, cultivators, private-equity groups and dispensaries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> &#8220;The shifting interplay between state and federal laws presents new challenges and unprecedented opportunities for Akerman clients,&#8221; managing partner Richard Spees said in a statement, &#8220;and we are positioned to help them capitalize.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Groups with ostensible legal ties have filed for Florida business licenses with names like Medical Marijuana Business Lawyers and the Cannabis Law Group, joining a wave of &#8220;ganjapreneurs&#8221; grabbing for a piece of industry profits.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> But the introduction of these powerhouse firms ups the ante, helping squash the images of two-bit, Breaking Bad-style &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; legal operations and legitimizing what could be a landslide of million-dollar corporate disputes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;We&#8217;re not the &#8216;pot lawyers.&#8217; This is not &#8216;reefer madness.&#8217; It&#8217;s 100 percent professional, 100 percent legitimate . . . and we take it 100 percent seriously,&#8221; said Troy Kishbaugh, a health care specialist serving on GrayRobinson&#8217;s regulated-products group. &#8220;We have a large health care base . . . and they want their patients to get the best care possible. And if medical marijuana happens to be part of that medical regimen, they want to make sure they&#8217;re doing it right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> The state&#8217;s biggest firms bolstered their practices this spring after Florida lawmakers passed a &#8220;Charlotte&#8217;s Web&#8221; bill legalizing a non-high-producing cannabis strain used to treat cancer and epilepsy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> An even bigger fight comes in November, when voters could pass Amendment 2 and legalize weed for a much broader slate of medical uses. Its prospects seem increasingly upbeat: A Quinnipiac University poll last week found 88 percent of Florida voters support adult medical-cannabis use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> If the vote passes, Florida could follow California in becoming America&#8217;s second-biggest medical-weed state, with around 400,000 patients spending an average of $3,000 a year, estimates from state regulators and a national cannabis-industry trade group show.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> State regulators have several months to decide on the law&#8217;s little details, leaving a huge window for &#8220;cannabusiness&#8221; interests pushing to find an unserved niche. The state Department of Health&#8217;s Office of Compassionate Use, which is drafting the rules, discussed at a public hearing Friday a range of potential enterprises, from medical-cannabis testing to home delivery.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Lawyers wise to food and alcohol regulation are shoo-ins for the firms&#8217; legal-weed practices: Many of the rules facing Big Pot, attorneys argue, could look a lot like those governing Big Tobacco, Big Food and Big Booze.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Joining them are lawyers with a vast range of expertise:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> • Health care experts to address hospital and physician groups on how to protect themselves while administering, storing and suggesting the use of a drug still illegal under federal law.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> • Banking and financial gurus to advise on securing investment, handling money and saving on taxes in what has long been an all-cash business.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> • Land use attorneys who can help resolve zoning and landlord disputes over where growers and distributors can operate from seed to sale.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> • Even intellectual-property specialists with knowledge on how to protect and preserve cannabis companies&#8217; strains, brands and reputations, in much the same way consultants have long advised Budweiser or Marlboro.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">For precedent, attorneys here are analyzing the legal laboratories of the 23 states, plus Washington D.C., that have legalized medical cannabis, and the two states, Washington and Colorado, that have okayed weed for personal use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">They also are following in the footsteps of nationwide firms versed in guiding the emerging trade. Seattle&#8217;s Canna Law Group, launched by international law firm Harris Moure in 2011, proved &#8220;profitable almost instantly,&#8221; partner Dan Harris told the Puget Sound Business Journal last year, adding, &#8220;We were shocked at the demand.&#8221; One of the group&#8217;s attorneys, a young University of Miami graduate, was voted &#8220;Marijuana Industry Attorney of the Year&#8221; in 2013 by Dope Magazine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">For the finer details, attorneys said, firms are following their clients&#8217; requests to lobby their way into influence. Litigation seems likely: A proposed rule limiting Florida&#8217;s medical weed to five nurseries, chosen by lottery, has already stirred up legal wrath.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Attorneys have likened their legal timing to representing alcohol outfits near the sunset of prohibition, a potentially historical chance to mold law and make nice with the grateful captains of a new industry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But GrayRobinson&#8217;s Blau, whose practice group is taking on three new clients a week, stops short of supporting the &#8220;green rush&#8221; of small-time entrepreneurs. He compares the early days of legal Florida weed to that of the American gold rush, in which organized business interests, not excited ground troops, ended up with the most to gain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;All those individual wannabe miners thought (they&#8217;d strike it rich) when they pushed forward to mine the Klondike … but very few emerged out of that with anything,&#8221; Blau said. &#8220;In reality, it was the established gold-mining companies who took the ground, and made it their own.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Colorado middle schools reported a 24 percent increase in drug-related incidents last year, according to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/18/colo-middle-school-drugs-marijuana-violations/23620235/">USA Today</a>. School-based experts tell the newspaper they believe the jump is directly related to marijuana legalization. Recreational sales of marijuana began on January 1, 2014.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Schools do not report which kinds of drugs are involved in the incidents, the article notes. State legislators are now asking school districts to keep track of which drugs they are finding.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">John Simmons, the Denver Public Schools’ Executive Director of Student Services, says schools in his city saw a 7 percent increase in drug incidents, from 452 to 482. Almost all of the incidents were related to marijuana, he said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Middle schools across the state reported a total of 951 drug violations, the highest number in a decade. School officials say while marijuana use has long been a problem, more students are trying it now that it is more easily available and socially accepted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“We have seen parents come in and say, ‘Oh that’s mine, they just took it out of my room,’ and that sort of thing,” said school resource officer Judy Lutkin of the Aurora Police Department. “Parents have it in their houses more often, and the kids just can take it from home.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“Middle schoolers are most vulnerable to being confused about marijuana,” said Dr. Christian Thurstone, attending physician for the Denver Health Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment program. “They think, ‘Well, it’s legal so it must not be a problem.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Meg Sanders, owner of MiNDFUL, a marijuana company that operates in Colorado, says her business is very careful not to market to children. “We feel it’s our responsibility as a responsible business to card not just once but twice for any recreational customer, and medical patients have to show several documents before they can purchase marijuana,” she said.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Legalize the use of marijuana creates another &#8220;addiction industry&#8221; and also does not help to end trafficking, said Kevin Sabet, 35, an American expert who joined the team of drug control of the government of Barack Obama. For him, the politicization of &#8220;fashion theme&#8221; masks the impact of drugs on public health, whose consumption is increasing among adolescents. to use the term &#8220;medical marijuana&#8221; only confuses people. &#8220;We do not call the morphine &#8216;medicinal heroin'&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">In an exclusive interview with UOL , Sabet showed data from a recent survey that will present the lecture &#8220;Impact of drug legalization&#8221;, organized by the <a href="http://www.spdm.org.br/eventos">SPDM</a> &#8211; Paulista Association for the Advancement of Medicine. The event takes place on Saturday (23) in Sao Paulo.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">One of the cases analyzed by Sabet is Colorado, which allows both the use of &#8220;medical marijuana&#8221; (since 2001) and recreational (starting this year). In the state, the sale of the drug is banned for children under 21 years. Even so, seven in ten adolescents in treatment for chemical dependency admitted to have used medical marijuana to another person-and, on average, it occurred 50 times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Even in Colorado, Sabet says the number of young people between 12 and 17 who used marijuana increased from 8.15% (in 2009) to 10.47% (in 2011), well above the national average, which is 7, 55%.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">For adults in the state doubled the number of drivers who, under the influence of marijuana, were involved in car accidents with death. The index rose from 5% in 2009 to 10% in 2011.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">In the 19 American states that allow marijuana use for medical treatments, Sabet says three in five students in their final year of high school can drugs with &#8220;friends&#8221;. Only 25% buy drugs from dealers or strangers. The margin of error was not informed.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Even the use of marijuana for medical treatment is frowned upon by Sabet. &#8220;We do not call the morphine &#8216;medicinal heroin.&#8221; Using the term&#8217; medical marijuana &#8216;only confuses people and comes from the belief that you have to smoke to get the benefits, &#8220;he criticizes. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The type of legalization that worries me is what is happening in the United States and tends to happen in the rest of the world: industrialization and promotion of other addictive industry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">In terms of effects, we also have to think, whether in relation to marijuana and other drugs like cigarettes and even alcohol in the future of our workforce. What kind of workers and students want? Of course we do not want to promote the use of cigarettes for our students, but if you go to school and smokes, her cognition is not impaired, you can still learn. You will not get lung cancer tomorrow. But if marijuana is different. It impairs the person in terms of learning, memorization, attention, motivation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">We have lived through a disaster compared to the tobacco and alcohol industry, and I do not want to raise the pot at that level.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">UOL &#8211; There are several studies cited including marijuana help cancer patients, since contain tumor growth, stimulate appetite, reduce nausea and relieve pain. With so many benefits, it is possible to advocate a total ban on drugs? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Sabet &#8211; Tue drugs using substances derived from cannabis is something promising. But we do not smoke opium to have the effects of morphine. We do not call the morphine &#8220;medical heroin&#8221;. Use the term &#8220;medical marijuana&#8221; only confuses people and comes from the belief that you have to smoke to get the benefits.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">In the United States, the so-called &#8220;users&#8221; of this medical marijuana are in 98% of cases men between 30 and 40 years without terminal cancer. They are also not seropositive for HIV, do not have multiple sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Basically, they have pain in the lumbar region. Logical that we should treat their pain, but there are other outputs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The impression of people is that marijuana is good because there are patients dying of cancer who need it. But frankly, if you&#8217;re dying of cancer, with six months to live, I do not care what you&#8217;re going to use [for pain].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">In addition, laws are being written very broadly and in many American states, legislation is flawed. The Colorado began selling the drug in 2008 All you need is to be 18 years and have headaches to get marijuana.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">UOL &#8211; What must we do to help patients in need of &#8220;medical marijuana?&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Sabet &#8211; We have to do special research programs that give patients access to experimental drugs. We should not sell marijuana on the corner, in a store, and say that is medicine, because this is not the way to act of medicine. I do not like this politicization of medicine, the medicine should be in the scientific field.If scientists in Brazil say tomorrow that we need to smoke pot to get the [beneficial] effects, we need to understand why this is and learn. But do not think that is the current case.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Let us study the components of the plant. I know it can be very good for a politician to say that it is in favor of medical marijuana. But honestly, we should not trust politicians talking about scientific issues [laughs]. Let&#8217;s hear scientists. And they are not telling you to smoke pot to get rid of your cancer.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">UOL &#8211; Earlier this year, Obama said that smoking marijuana is no more dangerous than drinking alcohol, but stressed that in any case, is &#8220;a bad idea.&#8221; Do you agree with him? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Sabet &#8211; First, do not think that there is healthy this equivalence to say that one thing is better than another because they are different. Alcohol affects your liver, marijuana affects your lungs. Alcohol affects certain parts of your brain, marijuana, other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">In the case of alcohol, we have a cultural acceptance. Alcohol is not legalized because it is a success for public health. It is legal because it has been used for thousands of years in Western culture, that&#8217;s the only reason.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">In the case of marijuana, it is not used for thousands of years by the majority of the western population and do not want to repeat the experience [like alcohol] again.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">I know far more people who drink a glass of wine with no intention of getting drunk. I know who smoke a joint without the intention to &#8220;have a cheap&#8221;. The reason for smoking a joint is drugging. I do not drink, so would not explain properly, but I&#8217;m not justifying do one thing and not another. There is a cultural difference in relation to alcohol which makes the comparison with the fake marijuana.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">UOL &#8211; Our former president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, is one of the advocates of marijuana legalization. What do you think of politicians like him? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Sabet &#8211; It is very curious that we have politicians who no longer occupy the executive positions in favor of legalization. It&#8217;s the latest fashion, it makes them come back to the news and makes them more relevant. I do not know in Brazil, but in the United States, when you become a former president, you&#8217;re no longer relevant [laughs]. Nobody talks about George W. Bush, even Bill Clinton.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">It is a very simplistic approach. Visit the slums. Do you think that more drugs will help these communities? This offers some hope to them? Not a hopeful vision.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">UOL &#8211; If you were a candidate for president of Brazil and was asked in a debate whether you are for or against the legalization of the drug, which speak? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Sabet &#8211; I advocate a health-related approach to drugs in general. This means increasing access to treatment, early intervention, training of physicians to identify the signs of addiction. Treat all problems early, without waiting for someone to give input in the hospital because it is using crack cocaine or four years ago. I want you to discover the defect in the first month of use to prevent the disease from worsening.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">And I certainly would not want to start a new industry like tobacco or alcohol, selling the drug. And I also would look at the key issues. Why are people using crack? What happens in the community where they live? Are much more difficult questions, but they are much more important than say if we legalize a drug or not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">UOL &#8211; Data collected by lord over the Colorado show that the legalization of drugs had bad consequences, especially for teenagers. </span></p>

<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Sabet &#8211; The only way would be to stop trafficking is sell the drug at cost of production. In other words, it would be like trying to get rid of trafficking in crack cocaine or selling the drug for pennies for each dose. From the standpoint of public health, you do not want that. You just want to raise taxes cigarette, you try to increase costs because the more expensive, fewer people will want it. You may be able to get rid of some of the harms and reduce some traffic, but not eliminate it. The output, once again, is to reduce the number of addicts in treatment and awareness campaigns.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">UOL &#8211; For adults, shows that you doubled the number of fatal accidents involving drivers under the influence of marijuana in Colorado. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Sabet &#8211; legalization advocates could even argue that drivers &#8220;were not under the influence of drugs&#8221;, but as they were fatal accidents, tests on the victims showed high levels of substances derived from cannabis in organisms. Of course not every accident caused by a drunk driver occurs due to intake of alcohol. Most likely, it could be because he sent an SMS at the time. But it is a big risk factor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Many teens think that driving under the influence of marijuana is safe. But I say that it is dangerous to drive on a road where the limit is 70 km / h, so 30 km / h to 100 km / h. Even if marijuana makes you slower, it is also dangerous. It also affects your depth perception and your reaction time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">UOL &#8211; There should be stricter laws in Colorado against these drivers? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Sabet &#8211; The issue of legalization is that you create space for a completely new political group that will do anything to make access to drugs as easy as possible. Then, during the campaigns of legalization they say: &#8220;do not worry, we will oversee and regulate.&#8221;The next minute, they shy away. In power, they hold the money, will influence the advice of the small towns, giving money to politicians to create 20 shops selling marijuana in a local community. Ie, you have these defenders who will try to minimize all the dangers of driving under the influence of drugs. Their message to the children, for example, is that smoking marijuana is safer than drinking alcohol.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">UOL &#8211; If legalization is not an option, which would then be proposed to reduce the consumption of drugs? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Sabet &#8211; The question is: what do you think the worst? A legal market to reach 25-50% of the population, because it will increase the use of the drug or an illegal market that reaches 7%? Both are bad, but I would opt for the second scenario and work to reduce this rate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">We need better prevention and awareness, particularly for teenagers campaigns. Over the past decade, scientific research have advanced tremendously with regard to the effects of drugs on the adolescent brain, but at the same time, the perception of these young people from the harmful effects of marijuana is decreasing. This owes much to discussions of legalization.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Many people find that marijuana is not addictive, but rather addictive. And is also associated with severe mental illness. We need more campaigns, more research, more treatment. In the case of trafficking, we need to give more alternatives for youth, for the sale of the drug did not show more profitable than legitimate work. It is necessary to solve social problems.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">UOL &#8211; Uruguay recently legalized the sale of the drug in the country, which should start in November, <a href="http://noticias.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/ansa/2014/07/10/venda-de-maconha-no-uruguai-e-postergada-para-2015.htm">but was postponed to 2015</a> This precisely because the government is still studying efficient methods to identify the buyer.. On occasion, José Mujica criticized how the drug has been legalized in the USA, &#8220;anyway&#8221; and &#8220;irresponsibly that scares&#8221;. Do you agree with Mujica? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Sabet &#8211; He is too smart to say it did not want to copy the state of Colorado and Washington, because that would be a total disaster. Would not be surprised if the sale of marijuana in Uruguay even start, or even never happen. It is not a popular measure, the government spent a few million on campaigns trying to convince people that this is something good, and yet 70% are against.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Rational argument is &#8220;let&#8217;s stop trafficking&#8221;, but again, unless you take the drug, give marijuana to children 10 years will still be traffickers. And is not that what you want. The president himself [Mujica] said he does not like marijuana, is not in favor of it, just want to control it. This is a much better approach than the American states. It is much more honest than some guys in the USA. But still do not think Uruguayans have a viable program. They are realizing that it is much more complicated than they thought it would be. So, good luck to them. I am very skeptical.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">UOL &#8211; For the United States, it is worrying that a Latin American country to legalize marijuana? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Sabet &#8211; I do not know if it would be a problem, but it is strange to the United States. The country does not want legalization, but it is happening at the state level. The American government will simply ignore the issue. To be honest, we only see them [and Uruguay Mujica] mentioned in the paper when the subject is marijuana. They [Obama and Mujica] nor talked about it when they met. So it&#8217;s not a concern for the United States.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">UOL &#8211; recently had here in Brazil the case of a five year old girl with severe epilepsy that caused more than 60 seizures daily. After <a href="http://noticias.uol.com.br/saude/ultimas-noticias/redacao/2014/05/29/liberacao-de-uso-terapeutico-do-canabidiol-esta-na-pauta-da-anvisa.htm">cannabidiol</a> , she had significant improvement in health status. However, the parents were &#8220;smuggling&#8221; the substance, and were not satisfied with that. How is this question in the USA? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Sabet &#8211; also have this problem in the United States. More than 400 children are receiving cannabidiol in liquid form legally by the government. However, you do not have data to show the effectiveness of the substance. If a parent is a substance that is experimental, unproven, then fine by me accordingly. I will not say to a parent of a child suffering hundreds of seizures per day not to use something that will help.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">But traffic or planting marijuana in the backyard does not solve the problem. It is necessary to regulate the use of cannabidiol by pharmaceutical and health areas.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A pair of new studies has revealed that marijuana use could lead to abuse of other drugs and alcohol. Experts said that these risks need to be considered not only by doctors and patients but by policy makers as well particularly in states where marijuana is legalized for recreational or medical use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">For the first study, which was published in the journal <em>Drug and Alcohol Dependence</em>, the results showed that adults who smoke marijuana have five times increased odds of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD) compared with their counterparts who do not smoke.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">By looking at the data of more than 27,000 adults, researchers found that the participants who did not have AUD but reported using <a href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/129956/20160202/this-is-what-happens-when-you-use-marijuana-every-day-for-five-years.htm">cannabis</a> during the first survey were 5.4 times more likely to have an AUD three years later.  The participants who already battle with an alcohol use disorder and were using marijuana were also found to aggravate their dependence on alcohol.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;Among adults with no history of AUD, cannabis use at Wave 1 was associated with increased incidence of an AUD three years later relative to no cannabis use,&#8221; study researcher Renee Goodwin, from Columbia University, and colleagues <a href="http://www.drugandalcoholdependence.com/article/S0376-8716%2816%2900042-9/fulltext">wrote</a>. &#8220;Among adults with a history of AUD, cannabis use at Wave 1 was associated with increased likelihood of AUD persistence three years later relative to no cannabis use.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The second study, which was published in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em> and involved more than 34,000 subjects, revealed that participants who used cannabis during the first survey were about six times as likely to suffer from substance use disorder after three years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Researchers also found an increased risk for drug use disorders and nicotine dependence among pot smokers.   Although the study authors said that their findings do not establish a cause and effect relationship between pot use and substance abuse, they noted that there may be an overlap in brain circuitry that influence drug use and dependence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;Our study indicates that cannabis use is associated with increased prevalence and incidence of substance use disorders,&#8221; Carlos Blanco, from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and colleagues <a href="http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2491944">wrote</a>. &#8220;These adverse psychiatric outcomes should be taken under careful consideration in clinical care and policy planning.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area released its third annual report this week. The organization has been tracking the impact of marijuana legalization in Colorado since the state first legalized the drug for medical use in 2000, passed legislation to allow dispensaries beginning in 2009&#8211;which spawned a commercial marijuana industry&#8211;and legalized pot for recreational use in 2012. The 2015 report shows that by 2013, Colorado marijuana use was nearly double the national usage rate. The state ranked 3rd in the nation for youth use in 2013, up from 14th in 2006; 2nd in the nation for young adult use in 2013, up from 8th in 2006; and 5th in the nation for adults, up from 8th in 2006.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/b.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14356" src="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/b.png" alt="" width="812" height="606" srcset="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/b.png 812w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/b-300x224.png 300w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/b-768x573.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Drug-related school expulsions, most of which are marijuana-related, far exceed school expulsions for alcohol use. Note the sudden jump in drug expulsions that began in 2009 when Colorado allowed a commercial marijuana industry to emerge. Total school suspensions and expulsions rose from 3,736 by the end of the 2008-2009 school year to 5,249 by the end of the 2013-2014 school year.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Marijuana-related traffic fatalities in Colorado also began rising with the introduction and growth of the commercial marijuana industry in 2009. While total State wide fatalities decreased between 2006 and 2014, marijuana-related fatalities increased over that time.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14358" src="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d.png" alt="" width="820" height="608" srcset="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d.png 820w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d-300x222.png 300w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d-768x569.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Colorado marijuana-related emergency room visits increased to 18,255 in in 2014.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/e.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14353" src="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/e.png" alt="" width="807" height="607" srcset="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/e.png 807w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/e-300x226.png 300w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/e-768x578.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Marijuana-related hospitalizations have nearly quintupled since Colorado first legalized marijuana for medical use. Again, note the surge starting in 2009 when growers, processors, and dispensaries were first authorized, and a commercial industry began developing extensive marijuana products such as edibles, vape pens, and butane hash oils (BHO) to attract new customers. BHO has elevated THC levels to the highest seen in the nation; some contain 75 percent to 100 percent THC.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Although there is no data to document whether the increase in homelessness in Denver and other Colorado cities is marijuana-related, those who provide services to the homeless report that many say they relocated to Colorado because of marijuana&#8217;s legality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In Colorado, marijuana is not available in about three-fourths of the state. Of a total 321 local jurisdictions, 228 (71 percent) ban all forms of marijuana businesses; 67 (21 percent) allow both medical and recreational marijuana businesses; and 26 (8 percent) allow only medical or recreational marijuana businesses.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><em>By </em>Kathy Gyngell<em> Posted </em>12th September 2014</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">For years the great and the good of the drug legalising world – including members and former members of the Government’s own Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs &#8211; have consistently denied that cannabis is a gateway drug or addictive. They have downplayed its devastating consequences for adolescents. They have derided or ignored cannabis prevention campaigners and the evidence presented to them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It is time for them to recant  &#8211; now and publicly &#8211; for their misleading and casual advice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">They can no longer remain in denial about the drug they have appeared so keen to defend, to normalise and to claim is less harmful than alcohol.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Irrefutable evidence of its damaging consequences for adolescents was published yesterday, in <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366%2814%2970307-4/abstract">a new study of adolescent cannabis use</a> , in The Lancet Psychiatry  &#8211;  a study in which almost  3,800 people took part.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Its objective was to find out more about the link between the frequency of cannabis use before the age of 17 and seven outcomes up to the age of 30, such as completing high school, obtaining a university degree and cannabis and welfare dependence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The researchers found that the risks increased relative to dose, with daily cannabis users suffering the greatest harm.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">They found that teenagers who smoked cannabis daily were over 60 per cent less likely to complete school or get a degree than those who never had. They were also 60 per cent less likely to graduate college, seven times more likely to attempt suicide, eight times as likely to go on and use other illegal drugs, and 18 times more likely to develop a cannabis dependence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">To its shame, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/09/study-teens-who-smoke-weed-daily-are-60-less-likely-to-complete-high-school-than-those-who-never-use/">the Washington Post</a> described these findings as ‘startling”.  The fact is that they only reflect numerous previously published studies and surveys.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">However, let’s hope that the that self-styled Global Commission on Drugs Policy and its leading light, Sir Richard Branson, will take note that Professor Neil McKeganey<a href="http://conservativewoman.co.uk/neil-mckeganey-called-global-drugs-commission-front-legalisation/">rightly excoriated them</a> on Tuesday   for promoting the legalisation of all currently illegal drugs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">It should be concerned and reflect on its gung-ho recommendations in light of this catalogue of damage; and so should President Obama &#8211; who seems to think kids smoking dope is OK.  He should really be worrying for under the lax approach of his administration cannabis use, or marijuana as Americans call it, has risen 29 per cent in six years, that is nearly a 5 per cent increase per year.  It is difficult to detach this rise from the effective decriminalisation of the drug in 23 states under so called medical marijuana legislation.  And the US is yet to see the full effects of the January 2014 initiation of legal marijuana in Colorado and Washington on the rest of the nation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Thankfully, in the UK the number of 11–15 year olds who say they&#8217;d used cannabis in the past month (4 per cent) has been dropping consistently over the last 13 years or so.  The number significantly less than in the US where a worrying 7 per cent of high-school seniors (aged 17-18) are daily or near-daily users.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Richard Mattick, the study author and Professor of Drug and Alcohol Studies at the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, in Australia, is right to stress: “Our findings are particularly timely given that several US states and countries in Latin America have made moves to decriminalise or legalise cannabis, raising the possibility that the drug might become more accessible to young people.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The cat is out of the bag in the US. Let’s hope here in the UK, those seeking to normalise cannabis use, including the Lib Dems, several members of the ACMD and a number of Government-funded charities will finally see how irresponsible they have been and are.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">WASHINGTON — A new report out from the <a href="http://www.ghsa.org/">Governors Highway Safety Association</a> finds that driving while on drugs, even marijuana, poses a significant safety risk on our roadways, on par with drunken driving.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Researchers found that the percentage of drivers killed who tested positive for drugs is almost the same as those who tested positive for any alcohol — 40 percent.  More than 5,000 drivers killed each year have drugs in their system at the time of the crash.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">“The proportion with drugs in their system has increased over the past several years and now the level is about the same with alcohol in their systems,” says Dr. Jim Hedlund, author of the report.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The report puts a special emphasis on marijuana use and its impact on driving because lawmakers across the country are debating whether to legalize the drug.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">“The evidence is very clear that marijuana affects decision times, reaction times and so forth.  If you are using marijuana, you are at an increased risk of being in a crash,” says Hedlund.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">He is particularly concerned that lawmakers are not considering the impact of marijuana on deadly crashes when talking about legalizing the drug.  Hedlund also says the laws on the books for drug-impaired driving need to be clearer and more in line with drunken driving laws.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">“Every state must take steps to reduce drug-impaired driving, regardless of the legal status of marijuana,” says Jonathan Adkins, executive director of GHSA.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">“This is the first report to provide states and other stakeholders with the information that they need.  And we encourage [the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration] to issue guidance on best practices to prevent marijuana-impaired driving.  We look to the federal government to take a leadership role in this issue similar to that of drunk driving and seat belt use,” he adds.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The report calls on states to take several measures to address the issue head-on.  It urges states to assess the data in their region, examine and update drug-impaired driving laws, test all drivers who are killed in a crash for drugs and separate statistics between drunken driving from driving while on drugs.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 8pt">Family members hold a picture of Haven Dubois, 14, who was found in cardiac arrest in a Regina creek on May 20, 2015. (CBC)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Richelle Dubois, the mother of 14-year-old Haven Dubois, says she is determined to learn more about the circumstances surrounding her son&#8217;s death. &#8220;I&#8217;m not done with this until I&#8217;m satisfied that they&#8217;ve looked into everything,&#8221; Dubois said Wednesday following the release of a coroner&#8217;s report that looked into the May 20, 2015 death of Haven. &#8220;I need to make sure that they&#8217;ve done their job properly.&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> According to the report, the Regina boy was found drowned. The report said boys who were with Haven on that day told the coroner that he suffered a bad reaction to marijuana.</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> The boy&#8217;s mother Dubois has expressed concerns the death might have been connected to gangs. Police said foul play had been ruled out. Richelle Dubois said last fall she had waited a long time for the coroner to complete her report on her son Haven&#8217;s death. (CBC)</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Coroner Maureen Stinnen interviewed a number of boys who were with Dubois, who said he was at school in the morning before getting into a car with friends.</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> &#8220;They apparently smoked some marijuana and they indicated that Haven began &#8216;freaking out,'&#8221; Stinnen&#8217;s report said. One of the youths Stinnen interviewed said it was Dubois&#8217;s first time smoking drugs. After getting out of the car, Dubois continued suffering ill effects and started walking away from the school, F. W. Johnson Collegiate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif"> Left alone on a bench</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;Witnesses indicate he was &#8216;spinning in circles&#8217; with his arms crossed at his chest,&#8221; the report said. One witness said he sat for a while with Dubois on a bench in a park, but left him alone so he could go get a skateboard and backpack. When the boy returned, Dubois wasn&#8217;t at the bench.</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> A friend said he last saw Dubois walking north by the creek in the area where his mother had discovered the body. Over the noon hour, Dubois was found face down in about a metre of water. Efforts to resuscitate him failed.</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Dubois had no history or depression or suicidal tendencies, the coroner said. However, a toxicology report indicated he had the active component of cannabis in his blood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif"> Reactions to marijuana vary, coroner says</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;The effect of marijuana on individuals varies considerably, from minor effects such as general feeling of well-being, to agitation and paranoia,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;These effects are subject to dose, age and experience of the user. Even in low doses, marijuana can precipitate a panic reaction and irrational behaviour.&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> Stinnen said the case was thoroughly investigated by the Regina police and while &#8220;questions remain,&#8221; there were no indications of foul play. She concluded that Dubois&#8217;s death was an accidental drowning with drug use a &#8220;significant contributing factor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif">Mother seeks more information</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Richelle Dubois said Wednesday she feels she did not get enough information from police about their investigation. &#8220;It&#8217;s so easy for them to brush it aside. It&#8217;s just another dead Indian to them,&#8221; Dubois said. &#8220;That&#8217;s how I feel; that we&#8217;re just another Indian family.&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> According to a spokesperson from the police, officers met with Dubois three times. Dubois said the findings of the coroner, noting how marijuana can lead some people to panic and act irrationally, provide a possible explanation for her son&#8217;s death, but she still has questions.</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"> &#8220;l know this isn&#8217;t the end of it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This little two and a quarter page [report] isn&#8217;t the end of it.&#8221; Dubois added she has made a formal request to view police reports on the case.</span></p>

Opponents in Alaska and Oregon could not afford to present other viewpoints in TV commercials. Meanwhile, after just ten months of legal marijuana, five Colorado cities passed amendments to ban the sale of recreational marijuana within their borders. The Republican gubernatorial challenger ran on a platform calling for the repeal of legalization. As citizens’ anger mounts over outsiders sweeping in, getting what they want, and leaving behind a mess for taxpayers to clean up, we are likely to see more of that.</span></p>

You would be wrong. The Drug Policy Alliance and the Marijauna Policy Project, their funders George Soros and the late Peter Lewis, a by-now burgeoning marijuana industry, and an estimated $200 million are behind the drive to legalize marijuana. Imagine a Congress where all 435 Representatives and 100 Senators belong to just one party, and you can begin to understand how one-sided marijuana initiatives have been.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">GOLDEN — Surging electricity consumption by Colorado&#8217;s booming marijuana industry is sabotaging Denver&#8217;s push to use less energy — just as the White House perfects a Clean Power Plan to cut carbon pollution.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Citywide electricity use has been rising at the rate of 1.2 percent a year, and 45 percent of that increase comes from marijuana-growing facilities, Denver officials said Wednesday.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Denver has a goal of capping energy use at 2012 levels. Electricity is a big part of that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The latest Xcel Energy data show cannabis grow facilities statewide, the bulk of which are in Denver, used as much as 200 million kilowatt hours of electricity in 2014, utility officials said. City officials said 354 grow facilities in Denver used about 121 million kwh in 2013, up from 86 million kwh at 351 facilities in 2012.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;Of course we want to grow economically. But as we do that, we&#8217;d like to save energy,&#8221; city sustainability strategist Sonrisa Lucero said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">She and other Denver officials joined 30 business energy services and efficiency leaders seeking U.S. Department of Energy guidance Wednesday at a forum in Golden. Energy Undersecretary Franklin Orr said feds will promote best practices and provide technical help through an Office of Technology Transitions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;It&#8217;s a big issue for us,&#8221; Lucero told Orr. &#8220;We really do need some assistance in finding some good technology.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Orr said he tried to figure out &#8220;how we would address that to Congress.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">When the EPA later this summer unveils the Clean Power Plan for state-by-state carbon cuts and installation of energy-saving technology, utilities are expected to accelerate a shift away from coal-generated electricity toward cleaner sources, such as natural gas, wind and solar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Until they can replace more coal-fired plants, the nation&#8217;s utilities increasingly are trying to manage demand by, for example, offering rebates to customers who conserve electricity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Colorado for years has been encouraging cuts in carbon emissions by requiring utilities to rely more on renewable sources.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Yet electricity use statewide has been increasing by 1 percent to 2 percent a year, due in part to population growth, said Jeffrey Ackermann, director of the Colorado Energy Office.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The rising electricity demand means more opportunities to save money by using energy more efficiently , Ackermann said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to compel people to reduce their usage. &#8230; But we&#8217;re going to try to bring efficiency into the conversation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Colorado&#8217;s marijuana sector, in particular, is growing rapidly, relying on electricity to run lights that stimulate plant growth, as well as air-conditioning and dehumidifiers. The lights emit heat, raising demand for air conditioning, which requires more electricity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;How do you capture their attention long enough to say: Hey, if you make this investment now, it could pay back in the future,&#8221; Ackermann said, referring to possibilities for better lights.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Southwest Energy Efficiency Project director Howard Geller said new adjustable light-emitting diode, or LED, lights have emerged that don&#8217;t give off heat. Companies installing these wouldn&#8217;t require so much air-cooling and could cut electricity use, Geller said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Lighting companies are working with pot companies to test the potential for LED lamps to reduce electricity use without hurting plants, Xcel spokesman Mark Stutz said. Xcel is advising companies on how much electricity different lights use, he said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Denver officials currently aren&#8217;t considering energy-efficiency rules for the industry, said Elizabeth Babcock, manager of air, water and climate for the city. Marijuana-growing facilities in 2013 used 1.85 percent of total electricity consumed in Denver.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;We see many opportunities in all sectors,&#8221; Babcock said. &#8220;Energy efficiency lowers the cost of doing business, and there are lots of opportunities to cut energy waste in buildings, transportation and industry.&#8221;</span></p>

        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">There has been a lot of talk recently about marijuana legalization — increasing tax revenue for states, getting nonviolent offenders out of the prison system, protecting personal liberty, possible health benefits for those with severe illnesses. These are good and important conversations to have, and smart people from across the ideological spectrum are sharing their perspectives.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">But one key dimension of the issue has been left out of the discussion until now: the marketing machine that will spring up to support these now-legal businesses, and the detrimental effect this will have on our kids.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Curious how this might work? Look no further than Big Tobacco. In 1999, the year after a massive legal settlement that restricted certain forms of advertising, the major cigarette companies spent a record $8.4 billion on marketing. In 2011, that number reached $8.8 billion, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. To put it into context, the auto industry spent less than half of that on advertising in 2011, and car ads are everywhere.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">At the same time, despite advertising bans, these notoriously sneaky tobacco companies continue to find creative ways to target kids. Data from the 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that the most heavily marketed brands of cigarettes were also the most popular among people under 18.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This is not a coincidence, and gets to the very core of Big Tobacco&#8217;s approach: Hook them young, and they have a customer for life. Why do we think the legal marijuana industry will behave differently from Big Tobacco? When the goal is addiction, all bets are off.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In Colorado, where there are new rules governing how legal marijuana is advertised in traditional media, there are still many opportunities to market online and at concerts, festivals and other venues where kids will be present. Joe Camel might be retired, but he&#8217;s been replaced by other gimmicks to get kids hooked — like snus and flavored cigarettes. The marijuana industry is following suit by manufacturing THC candies, cookies, lollipops and other edibles that look harmless but aren&#8217;t. Making marijuana mainstream will also make it more available, more acceptable and more dangerous to our kids.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Addiction is big business, and with legal marijuana it&#8217;s only getting bigger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Not surprisingly, Big Tobacco is also getting on the marijuana bandwagon. Manufacturers Altria and Brown &amp; Williamson have registered domain names that include the words &#8220;marijuana&#8221; and &#8220;cannabis.&#8221; Imagine how much they will spend peddling their new brand of addiction to our kids. We cannot sit by while these companies open a new front in their battle against our children&#8217;s health.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Why is this an issue? There is a mistaken assumption that marijuana is harmless. It is not. Marijuana use is linked with mental illness, depression, anxiety and psychosis. It affects parts of the brain responsible for memory, learning, attention and reaction time. Developing brains are especially susceptible to all of the negative effects of marijuana and other drug use. In fact, poison control centers in Colorado and Washington state have seen an increase in the number of calls regarding marijuana poisoning. This isn&#8217;t a surprise — with legal marijuana comes a host of unintended consequences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">I&#8217;ve spent the past several years after leaving Congress advocating for a health care system that treats the brain like it does any other organ in the body. Effective mental health care, especially when it comes to children, is critically important.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Knowing what we now know about the effects of marijuana on the brain, can we really afford to ignore its consequences in the name of legalization? Our No. 1 priority needs to be protecting our kids from this emerging public health crisis. The rights of pot smokers and the marijuana industry end where our children&#8217;s health begins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">I&#8217;m not alone in my concerns about this trend toward legalization. Even Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper has said that marijuana legalization in his state was &#8220;reckless&#8221; and reaffirmed his opposition to it during his campaign for re-election. He also said he will &#8220;regulate the heck&#8221; out of it. For that, I applaud his leadership and courage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia have legalization ballot measures up for a vote this fall. I hope common sense will prevail, and they choose a better path than making addiction the law of the land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">At the end of the day, legalizing and marketing marijuana is making drug use acceptable and mainstream. Just as Big Tobacco lied to Americans for decades about the deadly consequences of smoking, we can&#8217;t let &#8220;big marijuana&#8221; follow in its footsteps, target our kids and profit from addiction.</span></p>

        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>AS THE LEGAL AND MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA BECOMES MORE COMMONPLACE, OFFICIALS ARE STRUGGLING TO DETERMINE AND ENFORCE SAFE LEVELS OF IMPAIRMENT.   </p>
<p>Determining how intoxicated someone is can be quite a difficult task. For alcohol consumption, a substance that the body excretes in a quick, linear fashion, we can measure the amount of metabolic by-products present in the blood using a breathalyzer, or directly measure ethanol levels with a blood test. </p>
<p>Although the issue is somewhat complicated by differing tolerances, research conducted throughout the 20th century showed that nearly everyone loses their ability to drive safely above certain blood alcohol levels. </p>
<p>In the US, medical marijuana is legal in 29 states and adult recreational use is legalized in eight. Widespread popularity of this psychoactive drug seems to necessitate a similar method for measuring whether or not someone is too high to drive. </p>
<p>Actually creating a “weed breathalyzer” or other marijuana field sobriety test, however, is fraught with scientific complications. According to a commentary published in Trends in Molecular Medicine, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana, THC, not only lingers in the body inconsistently, it also has unpredictable cognitive effects between users. </p>
<p>Early medical studies implied that THC could be detected in the blood for approximately six hours after smoking. Yet subsequent work by the article’s co-author, Marilyn Huestis, found that behavioral changes and motor impairments may last 6-8 hours after smoking despite near zero blood levels after just 2.5 hours.  </p>
<p>Even if THC blood levels could accurately judge impairment, taking blood samples after a suspicious accident is likely to be fruitless for law enforcement. </p>
<p>“[Blood levels decline by] 74 percent in the first 30 minutes, and 90 percent by 1.4 hours,” said Huestis to Wired. “And the reason that&#8217;s important is because in the US, the average time to get blood drawn [after arrest] is between 1.4 and 4 hours.” </p>
<p>So why do people continue to feel stoned long after the drug is gone from the blood? Unlike ethanol, a hydrophilic molecule, THC doesn’t like hanging out in the water-based blood plasma and rapidly distributes into the cells of lipophilic fatty tissues, organs, and the brain. </p>
<p>“In fact, individual experiences reflect two different levels of drug ‘high,’” the article states. “..Namely a low ‘high’ effect in the absorption phase during cannabis inhalation, and a much higher effect later during the distribution phase owing to the lag time for full distribution of the active THC to the site of action – in this case, the brain.” </p>
<p>Furthermore, the body does not metabolize all the THC absorbed by body tissues at the time of smoking, vaping, or eating; the excess is slowly broken down over days to weeks. Heavy cannabis users will develop a THC tolerance due to this chronic, low-level exposure.  </p>
<p>Consequently, occasional users and heavy users may feel wildly different effects from consuming the same dose of THC, preventing determination of a universal, safe dosage cut-off for drivers. A national poll from 2017 suggests that half of Americans are unconcerned by the prospect of stoned drivers on the roads, but law enforcement officials in many US states have drug-impaired driving laws that they intend to enforce. So, what tools should they use? </p>
<p>Huestis, who is also a senior investigator at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, does not support a legal driving limit for marijuana. She believes that, currently, well-trained police officers are best-suited for recognizing signs of impairment. Meanwhile, researchers such as herself are working to identify biomarkers that are more representative of the drug&#8217;s cognitive effects than blood THC. Ideally, these can then be measured using rapid non-invasive tests. </p>
<p>Another interesting prospect: Researchers at University of California San Diego are recruiting participants for a trial to develop an iPad-based cannabis-specialized field sobriety test. Volunteers will randomly receive marijuana joints at various THC concentrations, then complete driving simulations and undergo experimental impairment assessments.  </p>

		<p>One in five Canadians between 15 and 24 years of age reports daily or almost daily use of cannabis prior to legalization. They see it as “much safer than alcohol and tobacco” and “not as dangerous as drunk driving.”  </p>

</em></p>
<p>One of the enduring myths about marijuana is that it is “harmless” and can be safely used by teens. </p>
<p>Many high school teachers would beg to disagree, and consider the legalization of marijuana to be the biggest upcoming challenge in and around schools. And the evidence is on their side. </p>
<p>As an education researcher, I have visited hundreds of schools over four decades, conducting research into both education policy and teen mental health. I’ve come to recognize when policy changes are going awry and bound to have unintended effects. As Canadian provinces scramble to establish their implementation policies before the promised marijuana legalization date of July 2018, I believe three major education policy concerns remain unaddressed. </p>
<p>These are that marijuana use by children and youth is harmful to brain development, that it impacts negatively upon academic success and that legalization is likely to increase the number of teen users. </p>
<p><strong>‘Much safer than alcohol’<br />
</strong><br />
Across Canada, province after province has been announcing its marijuana implementation policy, focusing almost exclusively on the control and regulation of the previously illegal substance. This has provoked fierce debates over who will reap most of the excise tax windfall and whether cannabis will be sold in government stores or delegated to heavily regulated private vendors. </p>
<p>All of the provincial pronouncements claim that their policy will be designed to protect “public health and safety” and safeguard “children and youth” from “harmful effects.” </p>
<p>Still, one in five young people between 15 and 24 years of age, according to a recent national study, report daily or almost daily use of cannabis. </p>
<p>They also see marijuana as “much safer than alcohol and tobacco” and “not as dangerous as drunk driving.” </p>
<p>Few either know about or seem concerned over the clear linkage between heavy use and early-onset psychosis. </p>
<p><strong>Early-onset paranoid psychosis<br />
</strong><br />
So what does the evidence say? First, heavy marijuana use can, and does, damage brain development in youth aged 13 to 18. A 2015 Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse study confirmed the direct link between cannabis use and loss of concentration and memory, jumbled thinking and early onset paranoid psychosis.</p>
<p>One of the leaders in the medical field, Dr. Phil Tibbo, initiator of Nova Scotia’s Weed Myths campaign targeting teens, has seen the evidence, first hand, of what heavy use can do as director of Nova Scotia’s Early Psychosis Program. His brain research shows that regular marijuana use leads to an increased risk of developing psychosis and schizophrenia and effectively explodes popular and rather blasé notions that marijuana is “harmless” to teens and “recreational use” is simply “fun” and “healthy.” </p>
<p>Damaging to academic performance Second, marijuana negatively impacts neurocognitive performance in teens and users perform more poorly in quantitative subjects requiring precision — like mathematics and senior science. </p>
<p>In 2017, Dutch researchers Olivier Marie and Ulf Zolitz found that the academic performance of Maastricht University students increased substantially when they were no longer legally permitted to buy cannabis. The effects were stronger for women and low performers and academic gains were larger for courses needing numerical or mathematical skills. </p>
<p>Third, legalization of marijuana is likely to increase the number of teen users. Research from Oregon Research Institute conducted in 2017 showed that teenagers who were already using marijuana prior to legalization increased their frequency of use significantly afterwards. Research from New York University, published in 2014, indicated that many high school students normally at low risk for marijuana use (e.g., non-cigarette-smokers, religious students, those with friends who disapprove of use) reported an intention to use marijuana if it were legal. Medical researchers and practitioners have warned us that legalization carries great dangers, particularly for vulnerable and at-risk youth between 15 and 24 years of age. </p>
<p><strong>Age of restriction </strong></p>
<p>Marijuana legalization policy across Canada is a top-down federal initiative driven largely by changing public attitudes and conditioned by the current realities of the widespread use of marijuana, purchased though illicit means. </p>
<p>Setting the age of restriction, guided by the proposed federal policy framework, has turned out to be an exercise in “compromise” rather than one focused on heeding the advice of leading medical experts and the Canadian Medical Association (CMA). In a 2016 submission to the government, the CMA argued that 25 would be the ideal age for legal access to marijuana, as the brain is still developing until then, but that a lower minimum age of 21 should be considered — to discourage children from purchasing marijuana from organized crime groups. </p>
<p>The report argued that: “Marijuana use is linked to several adverse health outcomes, including addiction, cardiovascular and pulmonary effects (e.g., chronic bronchitis), mental illness, and other problems, including cognitive impairment and reduced educational attainment. There seems to be an increased risk of chronic psychosis disorders, including schizophrenia, in persons with a predisposition to such disorders.” In fact, the minimum age for purchasing and possessing marijuana is going to be age 18 in Alberta and Quebec, and 19 in most other provinces. Getting it “out of high schools” was a critical factor in bumping it up to age 19 in most provinces. </p>
<p>Every Canadian province is complying with the federal legislation, but — in our federal system – it’s “customized” for each jurisdiction. </p>
<p>The Canadian Western provinces — Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan —have opted for regulating private retail stores, while Ontario and the Maritime provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and P.E.I.) are expanding their liquor control commissions to accommodate retail sales of cannabis. High school teachers, as of September 2018, may be battling a spike in marijuana use and greater peer pressure to smoke pot on the mistaken assumption that it is “harmless” at any age. </p>
<p><strong>Clamping down in schools </strong></p>
<p>For high school principals and staff, this will be a real test. </p>
<p>By September 2018, the old line of defence that using marijuana is illegal will have disappeared. Recreational marijuana will be more socially acceptable. The cannabis industry will be openly marketing its products. High school students who drive to school will likely get caught under new laws prohibiting motor vehicle use while impaired by drugs or alcohol. Fewer students are likely to abstain when it is perfectly legal to smoke pot when you reach university, college or the workplace. We have utterly failed, so far, in getting through to the current generation of teens, so a much more robust approach is in order. </p>
<p>“Be firm at the beginning” is the most common sage advice given to beginner teachers. Clamping down on teen marijuana use during and after school hours will require clarity and firm resolve in the year ahead — and the support of engaged and responsible parents. </p>
<p>Legalization of recreational marijuana is bound to complicate matters for Canadian high schools everywhere. Busting the “Weed Myths” should not be left to doctors and health practitioners. Pursuing research-based, evidence-informed policy and practice means getting behind those on the front lines of high school education. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The percentage of drivers testing positive for marijuana or other illegal drugs is increasing, according to a new report. In 2013 and 2014, 15.1 percent of drivers tested positive for drugs, up from 12.4 percent in 2007.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The findings come from the <a href="http://www.ghsa.org/html/media/pressreleases/2015/20150930drugged.html">Governors Highway Safety Association</a>. The group found 38 percent of people who died in auto accidents in 2013 and were tested had detectable levels of potentially impairing drugs – both legal and illegal – in their system. That percentage is almost the same as those testing positive for alcohol, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/01/health/drugged-driving/index.html">CNN</a> reports.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The most common drugs detected were marijuana (34.7 percent) and amphetamines (9.7 percent), which includes nasal decongestants and drugs to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“Alcohol-impaired driving is still a big deal, but we have paid more attention to it than to drug-impaired driving and it’s time to pay more attention to drug-impaired driving,” said report author James Hedlund. He notes drunk driving has been decreasing as drugged driving increases.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">He noted one reason for the rise in drugged driving could be that “marijuana use is increasing, driven in parts by the states that legalized marijuana for medicinal and recreational use, and the second is that prescription painkiller use has gone up substantially.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The report found 6.9 percent of people killed in auto accidents had hydrocodone in their system, while 3.6 percent had detectable levels of oxycodone, 4.5 percent had benzodiazepines (found in anti-anxiety and anti-depression drugs), and 4.5 percent had cocaine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“Alcohol is the deadliest drug we have by practically any metric…and alcohol in combination with [marijuana] is particularly malignant,” Dr. Gary Reisfield, professor of psychiatry at the University of Florida, told CNN.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The report recommends that states train law enforcement officers to recognize the physical and behavioral signs associated with different substances.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Many of these companies claim on their websites that their products are completely legal because they are made from hemp and don’t have any psychoactive properties. The truth is they exist in a legal vacuum as long as they don’t market their products as drugs, which is why the FDA has stepped in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/525">Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2013</a> amended the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to exclude industrial hemp from the definition of “marijuana,” loosening the restrictions on strains of Cannabis sativa that are very low in THC. This has facilitated cultivation of hemp in the U.S., but a <a href="http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32725.pdf">great deal of hemp</a> still gets imported (1,138 metric tons in 2011) everyday from China, Canada and the EU. Before 2013, essentially all the hemp used for its fiber and seed was imported and regulated by the DEA. Since the Marijuana Tax of 1937, it has been legal to cultivate hemp with a DEA license, but the tight restrictions meant almost no one did it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Cannabis sativa that is low in THC may still contain CBD, so whole-plant extracts of hemp grown for industrial purposes could make a product semi-rich in CBD, if done correctly. A cheap extraction process like steam distillation done on a sample of plant material that is mostly stalks and leaves might extract some CBD, but it can also extract unsafe pesticides and toxins absorbed from the soil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Cannabis <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21938417">thrives in toxic soils</a> and accumulates heavy metals, so the soils it grows in needs to be carefully selected and tested for pollutants. If grown in another country, especially one with lax environmental regulations, hemp products might be highly contaminated.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>PHOENIX (December 18) &#8212;</strong><strong> </strong><a href="http://axiompublicaffairs.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6e86a71c75427284bd01f0f7e&amp;id=cc65f0ac4d&amp;e=afbe9c9681">New state data</a> from the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration shows that Colorado now leads the nation in marijuana use across all age levels and, most disturbingly, in the 12-17 and 18-25 age categories. Marijuana legalization advocates have persistently claimed that marijuana use will not rise with legalization, and that legalization will have little bearing on under-age use. This latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services proves otherwise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“Sadly for Colorado’s youth, the data now substantiates the theory that increased availability leads to increased use &#8212; despite <a href="http://axiompublicaffairs.us10.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=6e86a71c75427284bd01f0f7e&amp;id=46b16ad76d&amp;e=afbe9c9681">being assured</a> the contrary by legalization advocates. Arizonans should pay close attention,&#8221; said Seth Leibsohn, chair of Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy. &#8220;In Colorado, teen marijuana use has not only increased since legalization, it is now the highest in the nation &#8212; more than 73 percent higher than the national average. For those who recommended a &#8216;wait-and-see&#8217; approach based on Colorado&#8217;s experience, the results are in and they are not good. It should be crystal clear, in Arizona and any other state considering legalizing marijuana, that going down the same path would be devastating to our youth and our communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">“According to this data, Colorado is not only number one for marijuana use but also ranks near the top in the nation in its use of other illicit drugs,&#8221; said Sheila Polk, vice chair of Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy. &#8220;Serious peer-reviewed science warns us that marijuana does significant harm to the developing adolescent brain, causes impaired memory and judgment, lowers IQ and increases school drop-out rates. It is unconscionable to unleash this harmful drug on Arizona’s youth.”</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"><strong>A lack of guidance from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency frustrated Colorado&#8217;s efforts to decide how to handle pesticides and pot.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">State regulators have known since 2012 that marijuana was grown with potentially dangerous pesticides, but pressure from the industry and lack of guidance from federal authorities delayed their efforts to enact regulations, and they ultimately landed on a less restrictive approach than originally envisioned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Three years of e-mails and records obtained by The Denver Post and dozens of interviews show state regulators struggled with the issue while the cannabis industry protested that proposed limits on pesticides would leave their valuable crops vulnerable to devastating disease.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Last year, as the state was preparing a list of allowable substances that would have restricted pesticides on marijuana to the least toxic chemicals, Colorado Department of Agriculture officials stopped the process under pressure from the industry, The Post found.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;This list has been circulated among marijuana producers and has been met with considerable opposition because of its restrictive nature,&#8221; wrote Mitch Yergert, the CDA&#8217;s plant industry director, shortly after the April 2014 decision. &#8220;There is an inherent conflict with the marijuana growers&#8217; desire to use pesticides other than those&#8221; that are least restrictive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Another year passed before regulators publicly released a draft list of pesticides allowed on marijuana plants — a broader, less restrictive list than initially proposed. <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/marijuana/ci_27772719/pesticide-misuse-puts-pot-plants-at-six-denver">That only occurred after the city of Denver began quarantining plants over concerns that pesticides posed a health hazard.</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The marijuana industry &#8220;was the biggest obstacle we had&#8221; in devising any effective pesticide regulation, said former Colorado agriculture commissioner John Salazar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;We were caught between a rock and a hard spot,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Anything we wanted to allow simply was not enough for that industry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates pesticides, offered the state little advice about what to do because marijuana is an illegal crop under federal law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;We tried to work with the EPA, to figure out what to do, but we got nothing,&#8221; Salazar said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">With little federal guidance and no science to know which pesticides might be safe for consumers, the department made pesticide inspections a low priority, records show.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;Our current policy is to investigate complaints related to MJ (marijuana), otherwise focus on higher priorities,&#8221; Laura Quakenbush, the CDA&#8217;s pesticide registration coordinator, wrote to a colleague in a December 2012 e-mail.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Critics say the state bowed to industry&#8217;s influence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;Colorado has given the marijuana industry way too much power, way too much control over the political process,&#8221; said Kevin Sabet, co-founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposed legalizing marijuana.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;Regulators are trusting the industry and saying, &#8216;Show us how to regulate you.&#8217; They&#8217;re putting their trust in the industry,&#8221; said Samantha Walsh, a lobbyist who has represented marijuana-testing labs and the unions representing workers at cannabis cultivation facilities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;There&#8217;s been foot-dragging in much of the industry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a failure of the government to step in and institute these practices.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">State officials say it was important to take into account industry concerns.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;CDA felt there was a need to further explore all possibilities of how best to regulate and identify what pesticides could be legally used on marijuana. During this process, we believe we have identified a better way forward than what we originally proposed in April of 2014,&#8221; Yergert told The Post.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The agency is just now preparing for regular inspections of marijuana growers using pesticides, Yergert said, something it already does for other commercial users such as crop-dusting businesses. In July, the CDA began visiting marijuana businesses for &#8220;compliance assistance&#8221; that focuses on education and training.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">And last week, Yergert said, the agency began a new rule-making process to formalize the list of pesticides growers can use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"><strong>Heavy-hitting pesticides</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Marijuana and pesticides hit CDA&#8217;s radar in 2012 when a former employee of the Kine Mine, then a medical marijuana dispensary in Idaho Springs, complained to the state of not being given protective clothing to spray growing plants.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">CDA inspectors found two heavy-hitting pesticides — Floramite and Avid — were used on dozens of cannabis plants.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The CDA cited the business with violating a pesticide&#8217;s label restrictions. The state was unable to do more because it had not yet determined which pesticides could and could not be used on cannabis in Colorado.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">As commercial grow operations spread after recreational pot sale became legal in 2014, complaints continued to flow. Sales of recreational and medical marijuana reached nearly <a href="http://www.thecannabist.co/2015/09/11/colorado-marijuana-july-2015-sales-taxes/40716/?_ga=1.262102415.323463553.1426096966">$700 million last year and topped $540 million</a> through July. There are 600 pot-growing licenses in Denver alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;I think everyone thought marijuana growers were a bunch of organic growers who would never use pesticides on pot, but that&#8217;s definitely not the case,&#8221; said Mowgli Holmes, a molecular geneticist at Phylos Bioscience and board member of the Cannabis Safety Institute in Oregon. &#8220;A lot of this pesticide use is new and driven by commercial pressures.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">When large numbers of cannabis plants are grown indoors and in close proximity, they are vulnerable to mites and powdery mildews, which can destroy a crop quickly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">To date, there have been 24 inquiries into pesticide complaints involving marijuana businesses, CDA officials said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Another early complaint came in 2012 when a consumer said a popular cannabis leaf wash for killing bugs claimed to be &#8220;99.9999%&#8221; water that worked because of an ionic charge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">A state lab found it actually contained high levels of &#8220;pyrethrin, a plant-based insecticide that requires EPA registration,&#8221; wrote Quakenbush, the CDA&#8217;s pesticide registration coordinator.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Officials determined that because the product label did not say that it contained a pesticide, they lacked authority over its use, according to e-mails. The state referred the mislabelling problem to the EPA for investigation, and the state did not look further into the issue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">But the case led state inspectors to send several e-mails to the EPA seeking guidance on how to handle the emerging pesticide problem. Officials also asked whether pesticides allowed on tobacco would suffice. The state received no response, according to e-mails the state provided.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The federal agency responded in an e-mail to The Post that &#8220;over the past several years, the U.S. EPA has had interactions with representatives from the Colorado Department of Agriculture on this issue&#8221; but provided no details.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"><strong>Health impact</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Colorado initially wanted to do as New Hampshire did, allowing only the least harmful pesticides to be used in marijuana cultivation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Those included neem, cinnamon and peppermint oils — products so nontoxic that federal registration is not required and no tolerance level is necessary for their residues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">By restricting cannabis growers to those products, Colorado could adapt its rules over time as more information became known about the health impact of chemical residues from pesticides.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Before the sale of recreational pot became legal in 2014, &#8220;a majority in the industry&#8217;s underground didn&#8217;t have very sophisticated practices and were using lots of toxic things they shouldn&#8217;t have on a regular basis,&#8221; said Devin Liles, who runs The Farm cultivation facility in Boulder.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">In April 2014, the CDA laid out the issue: &#8220;For food crops, a tolerance (of pesticide residues) must be established. No tolerances have been established for marijuana because they are not recognized as a legal &#8216;agricultural crop.&#8217; &#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Put simply, many pesticides that the marijuana industry was already using — some of them allowed by the EPA on food crops — were to be off the table.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Small, informal working group meetings were held in March and April. Liles said other members of a group on which he participated immediately were worried.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;Some operations were really concerned because what they were using was now on the chopping block,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and they didn&#8217;t know if it would become more restrictive later.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The proposed rule was published, and a meeting during which stakeholders could speak was scheduled for that May.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;The Colorado Department of Agriculture does not recommend the use of any pesticide not specifically tested, labeled and assigned a set tolerance for use on marijuana because the health effects on consumers are unknown,&#8221; the proposed rule said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Then in late April 2014, soon after CDA issued the proposed rule — and following two meetings where officials heard the industry&#8217;s reaction — the agency pulled the plug on its rule-making process.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;The termination will allow the agency more time to meet with the representative group of stakeholders and further review the impacts of the proposed rule,&#8221; according to the portion of the Colorado secretary of state&#8217;s website where the hearings are tracked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;We continued to have conversations without having any resolution,&#8221; Ron Carle ton, CDA&#8217;s former deputy commissioner, said in an interview. &#8220;The industry was of the opinion they needed the same kind of access to pesticides that other growers were using, that this low-level stuff wouldn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">CDA and the marijuana industry continued to wrangle. That June, CDA shared copies of an early, broadened draft list of approved pesticides with at least one industry group.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;The list never meant much because it was always in draft form, never formalized or finalized, and rule-making never occurred,&#8221; Michael Elliott, executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group, told The Post in an e-mail.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">At a CDA meeting with businesses in December, Elliott said growers were frustrated because they did not believe the state was giving them the tools necessary to fight the problems they faced.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;We need clean product, and we have a huge list of things to test for and failure could literally shut down a business,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Meanwhile, CDA continued its policy of not checking to see what pesticides marijuana growers were using unless someone complained.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;To date, CDA has not actively sought to inspect and enforce the provisions of the (Colorado) Pesticide Applicator&#8217;s Act on marijuana producers,&#8221; Yergert, CDA&#8217;s plant industry director, wrote in a memo for a meeting in December. The Pesticide Applicator&#8217;s Act is the state&#8217;s authority to enforce EPA pesticide laws.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The delays had Yergert worried that CDA&#8217;s inaction could be problematic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;The last thing that I want is somebody to get sick and they say it was due to pesticide use&#8221; and that the state knew about it, he said at the December meeting with industry representatives. &#8220;None of us wants to be in front of that train.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt"><strong>Turning up the heat</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">While state regulators and the industry debated how pesticides should be regulated, Denver was about to turn up the heat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Denver firefighters conducting routine safety inspections of marijuana growhouses in early 2014 discovered some growers were burning sulphur as a fumigant to kill mites. Firefighters say that&#8217;s a fire hazard.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Once stopped from using the dangerous substance, the growers turned to pesticides, and firefighters noticed cabinets full of odd-sounding chemicals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;They will do something to protect these million-dollars worth of plants,&#8221; said Lt. Tom Pastorius. &#8220;We stopped one issue with the sulphur. But that just led to a whole different issue.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The city&#8217;s environmental health department responded by <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/marijuana/ci_27772719/pesticide-misuse-puts-pot-plants-at-six-denver">quarantining about 100,000 plants in March</a> after application logs showed pesticides they knew little about. City health officials met with CDA and learned of the agency&#8217;s draft list of pesticides it said were OK to use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The meeting prompted the state to release the list publicly. It was the first time growers say they were fully aware of what they could and could not use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;At that time, we didn&#8217;t want to put the list out,&#8221; said John Scott, CDA&#8217;s pesticide program manager. &#8220;We were still working on the rule itself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">But once Denver had quarantined the plants, &#8220;we felt like it couldn&#8217;t wait,&#8221; Scott said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Pesticides on the list have labels so broadly written that the state determined their use on marijuana is permissible. However, CDA also says it does not recommend their use because <a href="http://www.thecannabist.co/2015/07/20/marijuana-pesticides/38233/?source=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dp-news-marijuana+%28Denver+Post%3A+News%3A+Marijuana%29&amp;utm_content=Google+International">no one knows whether the pesticides are safe when used on marijuana</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Three of the growers whose plants were quarantined fought back in court, suing the city for allegedly overextending its authority. Pesticides, the businesses argued, were the purview of CDA, not the city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The industry also turned to the Colorado legislature and had a last-minute amendment designed to stop Denver&#8217;s enforcement added to a bill about marijuana tax revenues, according to documents and interviews.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">It&#8217;s not the only example of marijuana growers looking toward the Capitol for help. Also during the last session, several legislators tried but failed to pass a law that would have removed pesticides entirely from the list of ingredients on marijuana product packages.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The enforcement amendment, which ensured that pesticide oversight of marijuana growers would stay with the state, was tacked on from the Senate floor on the day before it adjourned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;The worry was that communities could basically ban the use of some pesticides based on emotional responses rather than factual ones,&#8221; said Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg, R-Sterling, the amendment&#8217;s sponsor. &#8220;It was to codify that the state was in charge, not Denver, not any city.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The impetus for his amendment, Sonnenberg said, came primarily from conversations with three lobbyists who records show are with the Marijuana Industry Group.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Sonnenberg&#8217;s re-election committee had accepted about $1,000 in contributions from the three since 2010, according to state campaign finance records. In that time, he&#8217;s accepted about $1,800 from all marijuana-related contributors, records show. All contributions Sonnenberg received since 2010 totaled $49,900, according to state filings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">More broadly, the industry has spent at least $421,000 on lobbying on various cannabis-related issues this year, state reports show. In contrast, utility giant Xcel Energy has spent $230,640, according to the company. The city eventually won in court, but the amendment passed as well. Subsequent enforcement actions by Denver occurred at the retail level, far from where plants are actually covered in pesticides and where CDA&#8217;s pesticide authority extended.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The city declined to comment on the legislature&#8217;s action.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">&#8220;What was most frustrating about what happened in Denver is that the city went from not participating in the statewide conversation and doing absolutely nothing to placing holds on businesses,&#8221; Elliott at MIG said in an interview. &#8220;We would have appreciated having them involved in the state process and perhaps having worked out more local solutions instead of coming down quickly with holds.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Elliott paused, then offered: &#8220;That said, I understand why they reacted the way they did. They identified a safety issue and took action. Very little has been going on on this issue on a statewide level.&#8221;</span></p>

		<p>Comments below from David Evans Esq.,  a lawyer and special adviser to the Drug Free America Foundation, re the suggestion that marijuana could assist in treating opiate addiction. </p>
<p>WHAT ARE THE PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF USING “MEDICAL” MARIJUANA WHILE IN OPIATE TREATMENT? </p>
<p>Memory defect (short and long term) &#8211; how are they to remember compliance issues and new problem solving? Masks other mental health issues – anxiety, PTSD, Bipolar </p>
<p>Marijuana use impacts the brain, creates a delay in learning skills to NOT have substance use in life. </p>
<p>In order for change to occur, person must acknowledge loss of control &#8211; how can someone do this when control is still lost with marijuana? </p>
<p>Changes in coordination, mood swings, memory/learning problems </p>
<p>Marijuana use deters the return to normal brain functioning and the continued drive for more substances and stimuli in the pleasure seeking area of the brain. </p>
<p>Marijuana use is A-motivational – knocks out drive and ambition </p>
<p>Continued use maintains Arrested Development – low emotional maturity – the maturity level is stumped when start using substances </p>
<p>Recovery – means not using drugs </p>
<p>THC suppresses neurons in information processing system of the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is crucial for learning memory and integration of sensory experiences with emotions and motivations. Learned behaviors, which depend on the hippocampus, deteriorate after chronic exposure </p>
<p>· Because marijuana use impacts learning a person falls behind in accumulating intellectual, job, or social skills. This can directly translate to need for more treatment both with intensity and length </p>
<p>Users have trouble sustaining and shifting their attention in and registering, organizing and using information. </p>
<p>Increase risk of motor vehicle/work accidents </p>

		<p>Public Health and Safety Communities Applaud Move</p>
<p>DOJ Decision Will Dry Up Money To Marijuana Industry </p>
<p>(January 4, 2018 &#8211; Alexandria, VA) &#8211; The Department of Justice will announce today it will rescind lax marijuana policy guidance to US Attorneys (the so-called &#8220;Cole Memo&#8221;) and instead allow US Attorneys to exercise discretion in going after marijuana cases. The new memo will not call for arresting users or others with low-level involvement in marijuana, but instead makes investing in the marijuana industry a risky move. </p>
<p>&#8220;This is a good day for public health. The days of safe harbor for multi-million dollar pot investments are over,&#8221; said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama Administration drug policy adviser who is now head of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM). &#8220;DOJ&#8217;s move will slow down the rise of Big Marijuana and stop the massive infusion of money going to fund pot candies, cookies, ice creams, and other kid-friendly pot edibles. Investor, banker, funder beware.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Cole Memo and its compliance was blasted by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) in a 2016 report. The lead GAO author stated that DOJ &#8220;has not documented its plan for monitoring the effects of the state marijuana legalization.&#8221; A recent poll also found that when voters had more choices than just legalization or prohibition, support for legalization fell by 30%. Most voters were comfortable with laws removing criminal penalties for use but not legalizing sales, which the Cole Memo permitted. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Cole Memo had been waived around by money-hungry pot executives for years, searching for legitimacy among investors and banks,&#8221; remarked former Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy, a SAM Honorary Advisor. &#8220;It&#8217;s time we put public health over profits. This is a sensible move that now must be followed up with action so we can avoid a repeat of the nightmare of Big Tobacco.&#8221;  </p>
<p>&#8220;Marijuana, along with alcohol and tobacco, are the three drugs we need to stop our youth from trying,&#8221; said Dr. Robert DuPont, the first Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and second White House drug czar. &#8220;DOJ is doing the right thing by putting a stop to this wink and nod policy of allowing marijuana legalization.&#8221; </p>
<p>Corinne Gasper, who lost her daughter Jennifer to a driver high on marijuana, stated, &#8220;All too often, marijuana has been seen as benign. An industry not unlike Big Tobacco has downplayed its harms, aided by laws allowing officials to look the other way. For the sake of so many families, I hope those days are now over.&#8221;  </p>
<p>SAM, a non-profit organization founded by a former member of Congress and a former Obama Administration drug policy advisor, applauded the news. SAM&#8217;s Science Advisory board consists of more than a dozen top researchers in the field of marijuana policy ranging from institutions such as Harvard and Johns Hopkins.  </p>
<p>Dr. Stuart Gitlow, the former President of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, stated, &#8220;This is the right move by DOJ. To protect public health, we must choke the large amounts of funding spent by Big Marijuana to hook kids on highly potent THC products.&#8221; </p>
<p>Justin Luke Riley, the Denver-based leader of the Marijuana Accountability Coalition stated, &#8220;Recovery from addiction is so much harder when you are bombarded with the kind of pot commercialization we see here in Colorado. DOJ should be applauded for trying to put a stop to the shameless promotion and advertising that is killing our community.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ron Brooks, the former head of the National Narcotics Officers Association Coalition, stated, &#8220;This is the kind of leadership that will save lives. For too long law enforcement has been handcuffed by vague and unenforced policy guidance.&#8221; </p>
<p>Will Jones, a DC-resident who is fighting for social justice in minority communities commented, &#8220;Since the Cole Memo was released, the pot industry has relentlessly opened more pot shops in poorer, communities of color. Arrests are even higher now in many jurisdictions than before legalization.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Focusing enforcement resources on incarcerating low-level, nonviolent offenders will always be wrong and counterproductive,&#8221; said Kevin Sabet, President of SAM. &#8220;But there is an urgent need for Federal officials to reassert targeted control over an exploding industry that is undermining public health and safety in our communities.  </p>
<p>This is a major blow to an industry that is corrupting our politics and lying to voters in a steadfast pursuit to put profit over public health and safety. Today&#8217;s policy change will undoubtedly extend a chilling effect we have seen on marijuana legalization initiatives across the nation this year, and &#8211; hopefully &#8211; encourage lawmakers to stop and look at what science tells us about the unintended consequences of legal marijuana. </p>
<p> Like the tobacco industry before it, well-heeled lobbyists from the marijuana industry have been touting marijuana commercialization as the panacea for every contemporary challenge we face in America, but the truth is, the health and safety costs caused by the commercialization of cannabis are outweighing any tax revenues collected.&#8221; </p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">There’s no future for salmon in Northern California’s Emerald Triangle.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/a-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-14225" src="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/a-1.jpg" alt="" width="658" height="374" srcset="https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/a-1.jpg 658w, https://drugprevent.org.uk/ppp/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/a-1-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">On California’s northern coast are three counties that marijuana <em>aficionados</em> call the Emerald Triangle. In their view, the growers there have perfected a strain of <em>cannabis</em> that has high potency and consistently high quality. Result: There are many growers, most tending their crops in remote corners of these mountainous, heavily wooded counties.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This produces serious environmental damage. In Humboldt County where the largest amount of Emerald Triangle marijuana is grown, the sheriff’s office conducted an aerial survey and counted 4,000 visible outdoor grows, nearly all of them illegal. (California was the first of 22 states to permit medical use of marijuana, so some grows were established to serve users who have permit cards.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The illegal grows are usually carved out of forest land (often national forests or acreage owned by timber companies). Typically, the growers clear-cut the trees on the land they want to use, then bulldoze it to their specifications. Next, they divert a nearby stream to provide the one to six gallons required daily by each plant. They then fertilize the plants, causing runoff. This is followed by a generous dose of rat poison.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The upshot: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service a week ago declared that stream diversion by marijuana plantations was robbing the rivers that the streams feed of enough cool water for Coho salmon to breed, thus threatening their survival. California’s north coast is big salmon country, for both sport and commercial fishing. The declaration earned banner headlines in the local press.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This week the USFWS said that it was considering seeking a “Threatened” status for the fisher, a native cousin to the weasel. Many fishers have been dying after ingesting the rat poison put out by marijuana planters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Disruption of the soil for planting the crop and for cutting roads to some of the remote locations causes runoff that silts the area’s rivers—another preventable threat to the already endangered native salmon and steelhead.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In the area, a multi-agency task force has raided, on average, one marijuana plantation a week since January 2013. The biggest one, in August this year, yielded 10,000 plants; most have had several hundred. The plants are destroyed. The “harvest” often yields cash, weapons, and, sometimes other drugs (although multi-drug hauls tend to found in in-town dealer houses).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">In addition to the cost of the raids, “grows” on public land require public resources to clean up and restore the affected area.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Environmentalists in the three counties are quick to run to the battlements and declare all-out war any time the state Transportation Department sets out to widen a highway. With the regular pot plantation raids, however, they are as silent as mice. Occasionally, one will opine in an interview that the problem would go away if marijuana were made legal. This outcome seems unlikely. Large companies might buy up some tracts for growing (along with getting the necessary permits and paying taxes); however, not every small grower will be able to compete; hence, the likelihood they would feed a black market, selling to heavy users at below-market prices. Thus, one problem would yield to another.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Several studies have demonstrated that the primary active constituent of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (∆9-THC), induces transient psychosis-like effects in healthy subjects similar to those observed in schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">A new study, published in the journal <em>Biological Psychiatry,</em> reports that ∆9-THC increases random neural activity, termed neural noise, in the brains of healthy human subjects. The findings suggest that increased neural noise may play a role in the psychosis-like effects of cannabis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;At doses roughly equivalent to half or a single joint, ∆9-THC produced psychosis-like effects and increased neural noise in humans,&#8221; explained senior author Dr. Deepak Cyril D&#8217;Souza, a Professor of Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;The dose-dependent and strong positive relationship between these two findings suggest that the psychosis-like effects of cannabis may be related to neural noise which disrupts the brain&#8217;s normal information processing,&#8221; added first author Dr. Jose Cortes-Briones, a Postdoctoral Associate in Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The investigators studied the effects of ∆9-THC on electrical brain activity in 24 human subjects who participated in a three-day study during which they received two doses of intravenous ∆9-THC or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over, and counterbalanced design.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">If confirmed, the link between neural noise and psychosis could shed light on the biology of some of the symptoms associated with schizophrenia.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;This interesting study suggests a commonality between the effects on the brain of the major active ingredient in marijuana and symptoms of schizophrenia,&#8221; stated Dr. John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry. &#8220;The impairment of cortical function by ∆9-THC could underlie some of the cognitive effects of marijuana. Not only does this finding aid our understanding of the processes underlying psychosis, it underscores an important concern in the debate surrounding medical and legalized access to marijuana.&#8221;</span></p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">To present a summary of current scientific evidence about the cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD) with regard to its relevance to epilepsy and other selected neuropsychiatric disorders. We summarize the presentations from a conference in which invited participants reviewed relevant aspects of the physiology, mechanisms of action, pharmacology, and data from studies with animal models and human subjects. Cannabis has been used to treat disease since ancient times. Δ<sup>9</sup>-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC) is the major psychoactive ingredient and CBD is the major non-psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Cannabis and Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC are anticonvulsant in most animal models but can be proconvulsant in some healthy animals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The psychotropic effects of Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC limit tolerability. CBD is anticonvulsant in many acute animal models, but there are limited data in chronic models. The antiepileptic mechanisms of CBD are not known, but may include effects on the equilibrative nucleoside transporter; the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR55; the transient receptor potential of vanilloid type-1 channel; the 5-HT<sub>1a</sub> receptor; and the α3 and α1 glycine receptors. CBD has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, and it appears to be well tolerated in humans, but small and methodologically limited studies of CBD in human epilepsy have been inconclusive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">More recent anecdotal reports of high-ratio CBD:Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC medical marijuana have claimed efficacy, but studies were not controlled. CBD bears investigation in epilepsy and other neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction, and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. However, we lack data from well-powered double-blind randomized, controlled studies on the efficacy of pure CBD for any disorder. Initial dose-tolerability and double-blind randomized, controlled studies focusing on target intractable epilepsy populations such as patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes are being planned. Trials in other treatment-resistant epilepsies may also be warranted.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The truth is it can indeed mean trouble, especially for young people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">These days, it’s become fairly square to criticize marijuana and its rush toward legalization. Twenty-three states have condoned the drug in some form, with four permitting recreational use, and Massachusetts is set to vote on permitting it next year. The proposed federal CARERS Act of 2015 would let states legalize medical marijuana without federal interference and demote pot from a Schedule I drug — one with high abuse potential — to Schedule II. The path toward nationwide decriminalization is looking unobstructed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">But underscoring the incredible momentum to legalize marijuana is the misconception that the drug can’t hurt anybody. It can, especially young people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">The myth that marijuana is not habit-forming is constantly challenged by physicians. “There’s no question at all that marijuana is addictive,” Dr. Sharon Levy tells me. She is the director of the <a href="http://www.childrenshospital.org/centers-and-services/adolescent-substance-abuse-program">Adolescent Substance Abuse Program</a> at Boston Children’s Hospital, one of a few programs designed to pre-emptively identify substance use problems in teens. At least 1 in 11 young adults who begin smoking will develop an addiction to marijuana, even more among those who use the more potent products that are entering the market.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Levy speaks of an 18-year-old patient who had started smoking marijuana several times a day in 10th grade, dropped out of high school, and been stealing money from her parents. “She and her family were at their wits’ end trying to find appropriate treatment in a health care system that doesn’t consider addiction to marijuana a serious problem,” Levy says. “We are simply not prepared for the fallout of marijuana legalization.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Such perspectives have been obfuscated by those who might gain from legalization. “People strongly defend marijuana because they don’t want legalization to be derailed,” says Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School with the <a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/psychiatry/services/addiction_medicine_home.aspx">Center for Addiction Medicine</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">An insistence on the banality of the drug is especially dangerous among younger smokers, a population with an epidemic level of pot use. According to the most recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the use of tobacco and alcohol among 12-to-17-year-olds has fallen in the past year, but habitual use of marijuana among those 12 and up is increasing.   “If you go into a high school and ask the classroom, ‘Are cigarettes harmful? Is alcohol harmful?’ every kid raises their hands,” Gilman says. “But if I ask, ‘Is marijuana harmful?’ not a hand goes up.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">To bring balance to a narrative driven by pro-legalization campaigns, Gilman and others are interested in leveraging data to show pot’s real effects. Last year, Gilman published research on 18-to-25-year-olds that showed differences in the brain’s reward system between users and non-users. (“I got a lot of hate mail after that,” Gilman says.) And data supporting the hazards keep accumulating. Recently Gilman found that in a group of college students, smokers had impaired working memory even when not acutely high.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Physician concern for marijuana’s acceptance isn’t because doctors are a stodgy bunch — their scepticism is rooted in science and in history. In the 1950s, nearly half of Americans smoked tobacco, a level of adoption that rendered its health hazards invisible. Meanwhile, the corporate forces that drove cigarette smoking to its ascendancy actively subverted those that governed public health.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">While marijuana has not been definitively shown to cause cancer or heart disease, its harmful cognitive and psychological effects will take time to capture in studies. The underlying biochemistry at work suggests deeply pathologic consequences. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in marijuana attaches to receptors in the brain that subtly modulate systems ordinarily involved in healthy behaviors like eating, learning, and forming relationships. But THC — which has been increasing in potency in legal products being sold in places like Colorado — throws the finely tuned system off balance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">“Smoking pot turns the volume on this system way, way up,” says Jonathan Long, a research fellow at the <a href="http://www.dana-farber.org/">Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Each hit of THC rewires the function of this critical cognitive system: Early evidence in mice has shown that repeated exposure to THC causes these receptors to disappear altogether, blunting the natural response to positive behaviors and requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect. Marijuana exploits essential pathways we’ve evolved to retrieve a memory, to delicately regulate our metabolism, and to derive happiness from everyday life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">Medical science at its best operates independently of forces that drive the market and its associated politics. It was science that eventually curtailed the power of Big Tobacco and prevented nearly 800,000 cancer deaths in the United States between 1975 and 2000. As marijuana marches toward the same legal status as cigarettes, its potential hazards will require equal attention by science.    The argument here isn’t whether marijuana should be legal. There are champions on either side of that debate. Instead, should the drug become widely available, it’s to our detriment to blindly consider marijuana’s legalization a victory worthy of celebration. We must be cautious when societal shifts can affect health, especially among our most vulnerable populations.</span></p>

<div class="post">
                  
        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>For more than four decades, marijuana has been synonymous with Jamaica. It was traditionally associated with the Rastafarian community in Jamaica and is regarded as a herb of religious significance by the Rastafarians and is widely used as a sacrament in their religious ceremonies. </p>
<p>However, the use of marijuana has transcended its traditional use from that of a sacrament for Rastafarians and it is now being used as a recreational drug in mainstream society.  It has assumed both cultural and religious significance and is regarded as a harmless &#8220;holy herb&#8221; that bestows wisdom on its users. </p>
<p>Marijuana has permeated the society to such an extent that the taboo once associated with its use has her diminished, and this has led to it being more available. As a result of such availability, the &#8220;weed&#8221; is easily accessible and can be found in the palms of many of the countries&#8217; youth (12 to 19 years old), especially those in the lower socioeconomic communities. </p>
<p>With the amendments to the Dangerous Drugs Act decriminalising the use and possession of small quantities of marijuana, it is projected that more youth will be using the drug. </p>
<p>Given Jamaica&#8217;s history with marijuana use and it&#8217;s so, called powers of wisdom, persons are unwilling to accept the fact that this herb can have any ill affect on one&#8217;s mental health, and persons who admit to suffering ill effects from its use are seen as weak. </p>
<p>This policy seeks to address the effect marijuana usage has on the mental health of adolescents and outlines options for preventing marijuana usage and reducing ganja- related harms. </p>
<p> THE PROBLEM FACING JAMAICA </p>
<p> 1) Smoking marijuana increases the risk of mental disorders such as depression and schizophrenia in adolescents.</p>
<p>2) The decriminalising of small quantities of marijuana will only serve to increase the availability and usage of marijuana among the nation&#8217;s youth, resulting in increased ganja-related mental illnesses. </p>
<p>3) The focus on marijuana is largely on the criminal justice perspective. However, there is insufficient attention being placed on the issue of health, especially the mental health of young persons who consume the drug. </p>
<p>4) Marijuana is the most commonly used drug in Jamaica. Some of the active ingredients in marijuana have been shown to be harmful to the user. they can induce hallucinations, change thinking, and cause delusions. </p>
<p>5) The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) reports that the majority of marijuana users in Jamaica are between the ages of 13-25 years, implying that marijuana use is occurring in the most productive years of individuals&#8217; lives. </p>
<p>6) The World Health Organisation (WHO) and (others) have reported that the most prevalent disorder in Jamaica is schizophrenia, which has been increasing yearly between 2009 and 2013. These studies have also highlighted the connection with early usage of marijuana and the increase in mental illness. </p>
<p>7) The National Secondary Schools Survey (2013) conducted islandwide from a sample of 3,365 grades 8, 10, 11, and 12 students, revealed the following: </p>
<p>a) 43.2% reported that marijuana was the easiest illicit drug to access. </p>
<p>b) One in five students who were current marijuana users were at high risk for marijuana misuse </p>
<p>c) Age of first use of marijuana was 12.9 years </p>
<p>d) 30.8% reported that drugs(including marijuana) were available at their school </p>
<p>e) 50.4% believed that drugs, including marijuana were available near school. Students who believed that drugs were available reported significantly higher use than those who did not believe drugs were available in and around school. </p>
<p>The American Psychiatric Association (APA) is opposed to the use of marijuana. Its position is based the following on: </p>
<p>i. There is no current scientific evidence that marijuana is in any way beneficial for the treatment of any psychiatric disorder. In contrast, current evidence supports, at minimum, a strong association of cannabis use with the onset of psychiatric disorders. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to harm, given the effects of cannabis on neurological development. </p>
<p>ii. The use of marijuana/ganja in young people has been examined in many major studies worldwide. Results on the findings of these studies have differed. Some have found little or no association between marijuana use and mental disorders. Others have found deleterious effects of marijuana usage on mental health. </p>
<p>iii. Longitudinal studies conducted in New Zealand and Denmark suggest that the effects on the brain caused by marijuana probably explains higher rates of psychose. </p>
<p>The findings highlighted above suggest that the effects on the brain caused by marijuana usage can lead to mental disorders. </p>
<p> OPTIONS </p>
<p>a) A public education/media campaign (digital, print, radio, and TV) to develop and disseminate effective drug information for youth, parents, and caregivers. At the core of the strategy is essential information about the harmful effects of marijuana use. </p>
<p>i. To bring awareness to the fact that the teen brain continues to develop to age 25, therefore, it is vitally important that teens refrain from marijuana use as this use will affect brain development. </p>
<p>ii. Once youth perceive that marijuana use is harmful and risky, marijuana use dramatically declines. </p>
<p>iii. The longer a child delays drug use, addiction and substance abuse disorders are significantly reduced. </p>
<p>b) Teach life skills and drug-refusal skills focusing on critical thinking, communication, and social competency. This strategy will take on the following options: </p>
<p>i. Engaging families to strengthen these skills by setting rules, clarifying expectations, monitoring behaviour, communicating regularly, providing social support, and modelling positive behaviours. </p>
<p>ii. Encouraging social bonding and caring relationships, with people holding strong standards against substance abuse in families, schools, peer groups, mentoring programmes, religious and spiritual contexts, and structured recreational activities. </p>
<p>The campaign will have an enhanced focus on marijuana use and abuse. In addition to new national-level prevention and demand reduction messaging, the education-media campaign will work directly with communities to amplify the effects of the campaign and to encourage youth participation in the initiative through the help of on-the-ground partner organisations such as uniform groups, youth clubs, and national non-profit organisation devoted solely to the education and development of young people through policy and programme creation. </p>
<p>Since marijuana use has become ingrained in Jamaica&#8217;s social and cultural psyche, then any policy directed at marijuana reduction must be geared at behaviour modification. </p>
<p>Public education campaigns, whether they are used as a drug-prevention or health-promotion tool, tend to be based on their ability to affect behavioural change. </p>
<p>They have been successfully applied to the reduction of tobacco use and the promotion of road safety and have shown moderately positive results in a number of areas, including the promotion of healthier nutrition, physical activity, participation in screening for breast and cervical cancer, disease prevention, and other health related concerns. </p>
<p>EXPECTED OUTCOMES</p>
<p>i. First 12 months &#8211; 42 per cent improvement in perception of risks of marijuana use by both youth and adults; 50 per cent improvement in the disapproval rates of marijuana use by 12 to 19 year-olds; </p>
<p>ii.Year 3-4 &#8211; 70 per cent decrease in marijuana use by youth ages 12 to 19 years; 30 per cent decline in ganja-related mental illnesses. </p>
<p>iii. Year 5-7 &#8211; 91 per cent reduction in marijuana use by youth ages 12-19 years old; 75 per cent decline in ganja-related mental illnesses. </p>
<p>Despite the best efforts, some teens will use drugs invariably. Legislative and law enforcement methods offer an alternative to prevent and/or reduce adolescent marijuana usage. At the core of this option are the following strategies: </p>
<p>i. Mandatory counselling and treatment for adolescent found using marijuana. </p>
<p>ii. Mandated community service if adolescent continues to offend. </p>
<p>iii. Mandated prison sentence after the offender has done community service on two previous occasions. </p>
<p>Marijuana is the most widely consumed illicit (pre-decriminalisation in some nation states) drug. It is targeted in one way or another by most prevention interventions. However, few interventions have targeted marijuana specifically. Prevention is typically delivered in the context of wider informational activities and shares a platform with prevention for other substances such as other illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. This policy will be geared specifically at marijuana. </p>
<p>The recommended option of a public education campaign marijuana prevention and reduction programme offers the best alternatives for achieving the stated objectives of the policy. </p>

		<p>As part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s ongoing efforts to protect consumers from health fraud, the agency today issued warning letters to four companies illegally selling products online that claim to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure cancer without evidence to support these outcomes. Selling these unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims is not only a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, but also can put patients at risk as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective. The deceptive marketing of unproven treatments may keep some patients from accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious and even fatal diseases. </p>
<p>The FDA has grown increasingly concerned at the proliferation of products claiming to treat or cure serious diseases like cancer. In this case, the illegally sold products allegedly contain cannabidiol (CBD), a component of the marijuana plant that is not FDA approved in any drug product for any indication. CBD is marketed in a variety of product types, such as oil drops, capsules, syrups, teas, and topical lotions and creams. The companies receiving warning letters distributed the products with unsubstantiated claims regarding preventing, reversing or curing cancer; killing/inhibiting cancer cells or tumours; or other similar anti-cancer claims. Some of the products were also marketed as an alternative or additional treatment for Alzheimer’s and other serious diseases. </p>
<p>“Substances that contain components of marijuana will be treated like any other products that make unproven claims to shrink cancer tumours. We don’t let companies market products that deliberately prey on sick people with baseless claims that their substance can shrink or cure cancer and we’re not going to look the other way on enforcing these principles when it comes to marijuana-containing products,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “There are a growing number of effective therapies for many cancers. When people are allowed to illegally market agents that deliver no established benefit they may steer patients away from products that have proven, anti-tumour effects that could extend lives.” The FDA issued warning letters to four companies – Greenroads Health, Natural Alchemist, That’s Natural! Marketing and Consulting, and Stanley Brothers Social Enterprises LLC – citing unsubstantiated claims related to more than 25 different products spanning multiple product webpages, online stores and social media websites. The companies used these online platforms to make unfounded claims about their products&#8217; ability to limit, treat or cure cancer and other serious diseases. Examples of claims made by these companies include: </p>
<p>· “Combats tumour and cancer cells;” </p>
<p>· “CBD makes cancer cells commit ‘suicide’ without killing other cells;” </p>
<p>· “CBD … [has] anti-proliferative properties that inhibit cell division and growth in certain types of cancer, not allowing the tumour to grow;” and </p>
<p>· “Non-psychoactive cannabinoids like CBD (cannabidiol) may be effective in treating tumours from cancer – including breast cancer.” </p>
<p>Unlike drugs approved by the FDA, the manufacture of these products has not been subject to FDA review as part of the drug approval process and there has been no FDA evaluation of whether they work, what the proper dosage is, how they could interact with other drugs, or whether they have dangerous side effects or other safety concerns. The FDA has requested responses from the companies stating how the violations will be corrected. Failure to correct the violations promptly may result in legal action, including product seizure and injunction.</p>
<p>“We have an obligation to provide caregivers and patients with the confidence that drugs making cancer treatment claims have been carefully evaluated for safety, efficacy, and quality, and are monitored by the FDA once they’re on the market,” Commissioner Gottlieb added. “We recognize that there’s interest in developing therapies from marijuana and its components, but the safest way for this to occur is through the drug approval process – not through unsubstantiated claims made on a website. We support sound, scientifically-based research using components derived from marijuana, and we’ll continue to work with product developers who are interested in bringing safe, effective, and quality products to market.” </p>
<p>This latest action builds on the more than 90 warning letters issued in the past 10 years, including more than a dozen this year, to companies marketing hundreds of fraudulent products making cancer claims on websites, social media and in stores. Additionally, the FDA recently took decisive action to prevent the use of a potentially dangerous and unproven treatment used in ‘stem cell’ centers targeting vulnerable cancer patients. The FDA encourages health care professionals and consumers to report adverse reactions associated with these or similar products to the agency’s MedWatch program. </p>
<p>The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, promotes and protects the public health by, among other things, assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. </p>

		<p>Millions of people use cannabis as a medicine. That’s not based on clinical evidence, nor do we know which of the hundreds of compounds in the plant is responsible for its supposed effects. Elizabeth Finkel reports. </p>
<p>LAST YEAR DEDI MEIRI, A CANNABIS RESEARCHER AT THE TECHNION, ISRAEL’S OLDEST UNIVERSITY, RECEIVED A “BEFORE AND AFTER” VIDEO OF AN AUTISTIC BOY. </p>
<p>The before showed the boy helmeted, hands tied behind his back, butting his head against a wall. The after showed him calmly sitting at a table, sketching. The difference: two drops of cannabis oil administered below the tongue. The video had been sent to Meiri by Abigail Dar, an Israeli champion for the use of cannabis in children with autism. </p>
<p>Early this year it was a different story. Over the course of a day, Meiri’s lab received a stream of phone calls from Dar: a few autistic children had gone berserk after receiving their two drops of oil. </p>
<p>Meiri, who is primarily a cancer researcher, received the video and the calls because he has, reluctantly, become one of Israel’s cannabis experts. “Even now I am reluctant to tell people I work on medical cannabis,” he says. “I am not pro-cannabis; I think 90% is placebo.” </p>
<p>But Israel is in the grip of a vast medical experiment. Cannabis has taken hold here to treat a startling range of medical conditions. Not just familiar things like anorexia and pain in cancer patients but autism, Crohn’s disease, Tourette’s syndrome, epileptic seizures, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, diabetes and more. With close to 30,000 users in a population of eight million, Meiri says “everyone knows someone who is being treated with cannabis”. While there is a semblance of orderly medicine, with doctors prescribing cannabis oil from eight registered growers, no one can say just what, exactly, is responsible for the apparent responses. </p>
<p>A cannabis plant is a pot-pourri of more than 500 chemicals whose abundance varies greatly across different genetic strains and according to growth conditions – they’re not cultivars so much as chemovars. The medicinal effect may depend on tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the chemical that gives you the high, or cannabidiol (CBD), which is thought to reduce inflammation and pain, or a hundred other “cannabinoids” unique to the plant with their own medicinal profile. </p>
<p>Bottom line: with dozens of varieties grown under different conditions, Israeli patients are receiving quite different medicinal concoctions. </p>
<p>Israel’s predicament is tame by comparison to the United States. Here it is the Wild West. Federal sheriffs outlaw medical research on the plant while cannabis cowboys peddle chemovars (varying in their content of THC and CBD) for cures and profit. In the 29 US states that have legalised medical cannabis, dispensaries that resemble something out of a Harry Potter tale sell candies, cookies, oils, ointments and joints to an estimated 2.3 million Americans. As to their exact medical benefits and risks, no one knows. This is medieval medicine – akin to boiling willow bark to treat headache. It is also great business – the North American market for legal cannabis products grew 30% in 2016, with sales topping $US6.7 billion.</p>
<p>Israel’s medical cannabis mess is a lot easier to deal with. To help address it, Meiri’s laboratory of Cancer Biology and Cannabinoid Research is conducting a reverse clinical trial. While patients using medical cannabis fill in a monthly questionnaire, the ranks of analytical machines bursting out of Meiri’s lab create chemical fingerprints of the cannabis extracts patients are using. The idea is to try to link individual cannabis compounds to the patient response.  </p>
<p>It is an approach that’s “two or three rungs down” from the ideal of randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs), says Donald Abrams, an oncologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who prescribes cannabis as a palliative for patients with cancer. “But, if well done and there’s a strong effect, observational studies like these are invaluable.” </p>
<p>Israel is also one of the few places in the world pushing forward with gold-standard RCTs. But given that dozens of cannabis strains are already being used for a ballooning number of conditions, RCTs seem like a finger in the dyke. </p>
<p>Countries like Australia, where the federal government legalised medical cannabis in October 2016, are entering this brave new world with trepidation. “Because there has been no proper research, we’re now at a difficult crossroads,” says University of Melbourne pharmacologist James Angus, who chairs the federal government’s advisory council on the medical use of cannabis. “Our health workforce has no guidelines or experience in prescribing, and patients are demanding it. We’ve run out of time.” </p>
<p>The Promised Land may well be the world’s best bet for deliverance from the medical cannabis mess. </p>
<p>Anecdotes on the medical use of cannabis go back to mythical Chinese emperor Shen Neng in 2700 BCE. More piquant references can be found in ancient Roman, Greek and Indian texts. Or just google. </p>
<p>Thousands of years on from Shen Neng, it seems we still don’t have a great deal more than anecdotes to go on. As a report from the US National Academies of Science in January 2017 states: “Despite increased cannabis use and a changing state-level policy landscape, conclusive evidence regarding the short- and long-term health effects – both harms and benefits – of cannabis use remains elusive.” </p>
<p>While the medical uses of the opium poppy, a vastly more dangerous plant, are well understood, cannabis has remained stuck in a no man’s land. It had been part of the US pharmacopeia till the 1930s, as an alcohol-based tincture, until the federal government effectively outlawed its possession and sale through the Marijuana Tax Act. More draconian penalties followed. It is still demonised by federal law as a ‘Schedule 1’ drug with no medical use, lumped in the same category as heroin, LSD and ecstasy. Yet as a quick online search will show, the plant is lauded for a seemingly inexhaustible list of curative properties. </p>
<p>In the past two decades the disparity between evidence and anecdotes has grown extreme. Despite a majority of states (beginning with California in 1996) having legalised cannabis to treat medical conditions, federal restrictions on research remained ironclad. So researchers have great difficulty studying whether such medical uses have any basis in science. “What we have is a perfect storm,” says Daniele Piomelli, a neurobiologist at the University of California, Irvine. </p>
<p>Piomelli has been researching cannabis as best as he can. To comply with the mandates of the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), his precious store of 50 milligrams of THC must be kept in a locked safe, in a locked cool room, in a locked lab. “Any person on the street can go to a dispensary and for $10 obtain cannabis,” he says. “But if we bring it into the university we risk being raided by the FBI and DEA. We live in a schizophrenic state.” </p>
<p>Even when researchers have gained permission to do research, the cannabis can only be supplied by one authorised lab, at the University of Mississippi. The lab has been growing the same variety for decades, one that bears little resemblance to the chemovars now available through dispensaries. </p>
<p>In San Francisco, Abrams tried valiantly in the 1990s to set up a clinical trial to test the claims of dying AIDS patients that smoking weed outperformed their anti-nausea drugs. After more than a year trying to get permission from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the penny finally dropped; the agency, as he often tells journalists, sees itself as the National Institute “on” Drug Abuse, not “for” Drug Abuse. So the January report of the National Academies of Science was hardly a surprise. The document, based on reviewing 10,000 publications, found “modest” evidence for the effectiveness of cannabis to treat nausea and vomiting in adults undergoing chemotherapy, for chronic pain, and to alleviate spasms in multiple sclerosis. It did not, however, deliver a verdict for a long list of illnesses including epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson’s Disease, post-traumatic stress, anxiety, insomnia and cancer. “For these conditions, the report states, “there is inadequate information to assess their effects.” </p>
<p>But bits of information are trickling through. In May, a report in the New England Journal of Medicine offered evidence that an oily, strawberry-flavoured formulation of pure cannabidiol (made by British company GW Pharmaceuticals) could reduce the severity of seizures in children with a rare form of epilepsy known as Dravet’s syndrome. Of the 120 youngsters recruited, 60 received cannabidiol and 60 received only a strawberry-flavoured oil, the placebo. Three of the treated group achieved complete remission from their seizures while in 40% of those treated, the frequency of seizures was reduced by half. But 27% of the placebo group also saw a halving in their seizure rate and there were significant side effects amongst the treated group. “It’s not a magical drug”, explains Ingrid Scheffer, a paediatric neurologist at the University of Melbourne and co-author of the study. But she points out the sometimes exasperated parents of her patients have a different view. “The attitude is, ‘it’s obvious you fuddy duddy, just give it to us’.” </p>
<p>Most of the 400 pages in the hefty NAS tome report on the adverse effects of cannabis, like a raised risk of schizophrenia or road accidents or chronic cough. This, says Piomelli, reflects what researchers obtained funding for: “There is a bias towards the null hypothesis – that cannabis causes harm.” Those harms exist, he agrees. “But society is asking for answers about its benefits, and that’s not a question that researchers have been able to answer.” </p>
<p>Israel staked its claim in the field of cannabis research back in the 1960s. It was the beginning of the pot-smoking hippy revolution. But no one actually knew what the psychoactive ingredient of pot was. </p>
<p>Raphael Mechoulam, a chemist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, saw an opportunity. In 1964 he was the first to link pot’s mind-altering effects to THC. His research flourished in a regulated but permissive environment: his chief source of cannabis was the local police station. His group also isolated the natural equivalents of cannabis made by the brain, using pigs (with great difficulty, given the researchers were in Jerusalem). In 1992 they identified anandamide, the so-called bliss molecule, and in 1995 its more prosaically named partner, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol or 2 AG. These brain-made counterparts of THC are known as endocannabinoids. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the Israeli public began to clamour for medical cannabis. Just as in San Francisco, the AIDS epidemic had put medical cannabis on the radar. Mirroring the experience of Donald Abrams, immunologist Zvi Bentwich also witnessed the anti-nausea and pain-relieving effects that smoking cannabis had on his AIDS patients. While anti-retroviral drugs would mercifully bring the raging AIDS epidemic in both countries under control, the clamour for the palliative use of cannabis by cancer patients grew, aided by the internet. </p>
<p>Israel’s government obliged but with strict regulation. Patients, supported by a letter from a physician, could obtain a medical cannabis permit from the ministry of health. Growers needed a licence. One of the first companies to gain one, in 2007, was Tikun Olam. As patient numbers grew, it began to collect information about their responses. In 2015 Bentwich, who also heads the Centre for Emerging Tropical Diseases and AIDS at Ben Gurion University, joined Tikun Olam to lead a formal clinical trials program. “If the medical community is to accept cannabis, that depends on carrying out large reliable clinical trials,” he says. “In the US, as well as in most European countries, that is still extremely difficult.” </p>
<p>So far Israel is leading the pack. It is the only country, for instance, to have published the results of a randomised double blind study on the use of cannabis by Crohn’s disease patients. Timna Naftali, a gastroenterologist at Meir Medical Centre, carried out the trial after discovering several patients were self-medicating with cannabis. “They had reduced their medication and not suffered flare ups,” she says. “It was very intriguing.”  </p>
<p>In her trial, 21 patients were assigned randomly to a group that smoked THC-rich cannabis cigarettes twice a day for eight weeks or to a group that smoked cannabis free of THC and other cannabinoids. The results, published in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, showed that in 10 of 11 patients with Crohn’s disease who smoked the THC-rich cigarettes, there were “significant clinical benefits”. One criticism was that perhaps patients merely felt better due to the euphoric effects of cannabis, so Naftali is repeating the trial, leaving it to an endoscopist to decide. This time 50 patients are receiving an oil, containing a 4:1 ratio of cannabidiol to THC. “As a doctor, I’m not happy about telling patients to smoke,” Naftali says. Another trial that tested a pure extract of cannabidiol was ineffective. “Perhaps it was the low dose,” Naftali muses. “There’s also a claim you have to have it in combination.” Perhaps it is a case of what Mechoulam has dubbed the “entourage effect” – the consequence of a mysterious biological synergy between cannabis compounds. </p>
<p>Another world-first trial under way in Israel is testing the effects of cannabis on youngsters with autism. Given cannabis can trigger psychotic behaviour, it is surprising to think it would be a candidate for a condition where psychotic behaviour is often part of the problem. But a third of autistic children also suffer from seizures. </p>
<p>When paediatric neurologist Adi Aran, at Jerusalem’s Shaare Zedek Medical Centre, prescribed cannabis for the seizures of autistic children, their parents reported dramatic results. Children who never spoke began speaking, and writing for the first time. To verify these anecdotal results, he is running a trial on 120 youngsters, aged 5 to 21 years. Some receive whole cannabis oil containing, amongst other things, a 20:1 ratio of cannabidiol to THC; others receive a purified extract containing only cannabidiol and THC; a final group receive a placebo, an identically flavoured oil. All will undergo a ‘washout’ period, where they are gradually weaned off their oil. </p>
<p>In principle, most doctors would like to see the results of numerous such trials before prescribing cannabis. However, parents like Abigail Dar disagree with this approach. “A parent like me with a complicated child doesn’t have the luxury of principles,” she says. Her son, Yuval, now in his early twenties, is severely autistic, and was once so prone to violent outbreaks she could not be alone with him. “Yuval tried over a dozen anti-psychotic medications since he was 12 years old to treat symptoms </p>
<p>like endless anxiety, restlessness, violent outbreaks or, as we call it, ‘life in the shadow of hell’. They only made him more agitated and aggressive.” </p>
<p>Dar managed to get a medical cannabis prescription for Yuval in 2015. Though autism did not count as one of Israel’s qualifying conditions, the health ministry finally granted permission as a ‘mercy treatment’. “It was a life-changer from the very first day,” according to Dar. “He hasn’t exhibited a single self-injurious behaviour or outburst in the last 14 months. He is calmer, more attentive and communicative. He smiles more.”</p>
<p>Dar has carried out her own careful experimentation for what works for her son, using chemovars that vary in their CBD-to-THC ratio. As far as she is concerned, placing Yuval in a randomised, placebo-controlled, washout trial would be immoral. “With suffering kids you don’t take it away,” she says. “I tell parents to stay away; it’s not in favour of kids.” </p>
<p>Instead, through a collaboration with Meiri’s lab, she is pushing to gather the data already being generated. “We have 200 kids and adults with severe autism we are guiding through strains and dosages to find out what works. We track them with questionnaires: we look at things like violent outbreaks, sleep and appetite. The idea eventually is to go global. It will give us some small amount of knowledge on how to treat autism.” </p>
<p>It’s not just desperate cases like Dar that make cannabis a poor fit for the box of a RCT. Abrams sees no need for more trials when it comes to treating pain or nausea in patients with cancer. Nor is he alarmed by the range of products sold in dispensaries. “I don’t consider it to be that dangerous, compared to the pharmaceutical agents we already prescribe,” he says. “I have many patients that were weaned off opiates thanks to cannabis.” He points out that in the US, 90 people die each day from overdoses of opiates, in many cases prescribed to treat chronic pain [LINK: https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html]. </p>
<p>Mieri never imagined his CV would one day include heading a laboratory for cannabis research. In early 2015, after four years at the Ontario Cancer Institute, he was all set to return to cancer research. </p>
<p>Then he noticed a curious publication from a Japanese research group that reported a cannabis extract blocked the ability of human breast cancer cells to spread in a culture dish. What pricked Meiri’s interest was that the extracts appeared to be scrambling the cell’s internal scaffolding – his particular area of expertise. </p>
<p>Meiri repeated the experiment on different types of cancer cells. He found the cannabis extract was just as potent as some chemotherapy drugs. But it was another finding that really captured his interest: the effectiveness of the extract depended on the cannabis variety and the grower. </p>
<p>As the son of a strawberry farmer, he understood exactly what he was seeing. “Strawberries taste different in the morning and afternoon,” he explains. He was seeing the effects of a cocktail of different chemicals.  </p>
<p>Which of these chemicals were responsible for the anti-cancer effect? To find out, Meiri bought a machine for high-performance liquid chromatography, a technique to separate and identify parts of a mixture. Soon he was a de facto guru. A grant from a philanthropist in 2016 marked a point of no return. </p>
<p>‘The plural of anecdote is not data’ is an oft-quoted medical aphorism. But anecdotes can’t be ignored either. Meiri is acquiring quite a collection. On one occasion, he was contacted by the father of a seven-year-old whose seizures had returned after being free of them for nearly a year. The father, wanting to know why the oil had stopped working, sent samples to Meiri. When the scientist analysed them, he found they were just olive oil. “It was a data point,” he says, “showing that the effects of cannabis extract were real.”  </p>
<p>Then there was the disastrous day he learned that several autistic kids taking cannabis oil had gone berserk. “Tali, we have a situation,” he recalls telling the head of the project. All the extracts the children were taking had the same 20:1 ratio of CBD to THC. But looking at the chemical profiles, it was clear the offending medication carried at least five different compounds. “It doesn’t provide the answers,” he says. “It shows where to begin searching.” </p>
<p>There is no simple way out of the cannabis mess. With much of the world clamouring to use cannabis as a cure for all manner of ailments, and an exploding cannabis industry that is happy to push that demand along, it is crucial to establish just how real its clinical benefits and harms are – especially for children.  </p>
<p>The medical establishment ideally needs randomised clinical trials, such as those Israel is admirably pushing ahead with. “I would say the Israelis have taken the lead,” Abrams says. </p>
<p>But 30,000 users in Israel and millions in the US aren’t waiting for such results. Some, like Abigail Dar, are too desperate. Others are wedded to their own trial-and-error experiments with different chemovars. </p>
<p>Another complicating factor is that the diabolically complex chemistry of the cannabis plant is too overwhelming to sort out through individual RCTs. Researchers are still scratching at the surface of a potential treasure trove of medicines that appear to act synergistically. The list of conditions to try them against appears never-ending. The number of trials needed to test each combination against each condition seems mindboggling. </p>
<p>The database collated by Meiri and his clinical collaborators is now being prepared for publication. It should help link the pot-pourri of chemicals inside cannabis to its clinical effects. It may be second-tier science, but it appears to be one of the best strategies for navigating a path out of the haze that still envelops medical cannabis. </p>

		<p><strong>“No One Has Died of an Overdose” </strong></p>
<p>This remains the most outrageous claim of the pro-legalization movement. It is not only dangerously misleading, it is a slap in the face to the families who have lost children, spouses and parents. Everyone admits that people are dying in traffic crashes because of stoned drivers, and that some people have died in butane hash oil explosions, but too many people are turning a blind eye to the other deaths caused by what can only be called an overdose. Tachycardia – a racing heart – is a common, well-known side effect of using marijuana. So is increased blood pressure. A growing body of evidence, here and in other countries, is revealing that marijuana has caused previously overlooked deaths through heart attack and stroke. In Colorado last fall, an 11-month-old infant brought to the ER after being exposed to marijuana died from an inflamed heart muscle (myocarditis) caused by the exposure. </p>
<p>Marijuana can also overwhelm the emotional centers of the brain causing paranoia, delusions, and acute psychosis. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report released last January states, “There is substantial evidence of a statistical association between cannabis use and the development of schizophrenia or other psychoses, with the highest risk among the most frequent users.” (The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids, Chapter Highlights NAS 2017) </p>
<p>Emergency rooms in Colorado reported a 44 percent increase in marijuana-related visits between 2012 and 2014. Many of these were cases of acute psychosis, particularly in young men, who had to be restrained to keep from harming themselves or others. </p>
<p><strong>Other evidence of marijuana overdose </strong></p>
<p>A growing body of evidence indicates that marijuana is not just associated with suicide but can be a causative factor. The NAS report cited above found an “Increased incidence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts with a higher incidence among heavier users” and an “Increased incidence of suicide completion.” One of the studies they listed found a seven-fold increase in risk for suicide even after controlling for a prior history of mood disorders. </p>
<p>In 2014, a young man in Colorado either jumped or unwittingly tumbled to his death from a fourth-floor balcony during a psychotic outburst. In July this year, a Vermont father clutching his son to his chest jumped out of a fourth-floor window shortly after smoking marijuana. He said it was God who made him jump. </p>
<p>When a drug drives all sense of reality from your brain, it’s an overdose. In marijuana’s case, these overdoses can and do lead to death. </p>

		<p>Washington’s pot is a bit more potent than the national average. And the state’s teens are more likely to smoke marijuana than young people nationwide. </p>
<p>Although we have the same problems with marijuana as we do with liquor abuse, no blockbuster conclusions came from a recent report on Washington’s marijuana universe. </p>
<p>But a couple of somewhat unexpected environmental wrinkles from Washington’s marijuana industry — both legal and illegal — also emerge in the second annual look at the state’s experience since passage of a 2012 initiative allowing recreational pot sales. </p>
<p>Marijuana growers and processors use 1.63 percent of the state’s electricity, which is a lot, according to the report by the Northwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area — a combined effort by several federal, state and local government agencies. By way of comparison, all forms of lighting — in homes, commercial buildings and manufacturing — account for just 7 to 11 percent of electrical consumption nationally. Or, as the report puts it, the power is enough for 2 million homes. </p>
<p>The high power consumption stems from the heat lamps and the accompanying air conditioning for indoor marijuana growing operations. “They are exceedingly energy-consumptive,” said Steven Freng, manager for prevention and treatment for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. </p>
<p>The carbon footprint, according to the report, equals that of about 3 million cars. </p>
<p>And illegal pot growers siphoned off 43.2 million gallons of water from streams and aquifers during the 2016 growing season — water that tribes, farmers and cities would otherwise use as carefully as possible, in part to protect salmon. </p>
<p>Sixty percent of Washington’s illegal pot was grown on state-owned land in 2016. That’s because black-market growers tend to worry about gun-toting owners on private lands, according to Freng and Luci McKean, the organization’s deputy director. The black-market operations use the water during a roughly 120-day growing season. </p>
<p>Marijuana purchases have boomed in Washington. Legal marijuana sales were almost $1 billion in fiscal year 2016 and were on track to be about $1.5 billion in fiscal 2017, which ended June 30. As of February, the state had 1,121 licensed producers, 1,106 licensed processors and 470 licensed retailers. </p>
<p>What Washington’s marijuana users are getting is above average in potency. According to the report, nationwide marijuana products average a THC percentage of 13.2 percent, while Washington state’s THC average percentage was 21.6 percent. </p>
<p>Teen use of marijuana has grown slightly. Depending on how the numbers are crunched, marijuana use among Washington’s young adults and teens ranges from 2 to 5 percent above the national average. Five percent of Washingtonians age 18-to-25 use pot daily, slightly above the national average, the report said. </p>
<p>According to a survey cited in the report, 17 percent of high school seniors and 9 percent of high school sophomores have driven within three hours after smoking pot. </p>
<p>Adult use before driving is still a fuzzy picture. A third of Washingtonians arrested for driving under the influence had THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, in their bloodstreams. One study found an increase in dead drivers with THC above the legal limit in their blood from 7.8 percent in 2013 to 12.8 percent in 2014. </p>
<p>“Adults still don’t understand the effects of impairment behind the wheel of a car,” Freng said. </p>
<p>McKean said that one major unknown is marijuana-laced edibles, which authorities believe have become a significant factor in THC-impaired drivers, but has not been studied enough to provide solid numbers. </p>
<p>Another major unknown, McKean and Freng said, is how marijuana consumption contributes to emergency room and hospital cases because the state hospitals have not agreed to release that data to government officials. </p>

		<p>Legalising marijuana can lead to increased use of the drug, according to a French study that looked at consumption levels in two US states and Uruguay in the midst of a debate over France&#8217;s narcotics laws.</p>
<p>The study conducted by France&#8217;s National Institute of Higher Security and Justice Studies and the French Observatory for Drugs and Drug Addiction examined data from Washington and Colorado, which in 2012 became the first two US states to legalise marijuana for recreational use.</p>
<p>Like several US studies on the subject it noted that legalisation in the states had not increased marijuana use among teenagers, &#8220;which nonetheless remains at a high level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among adults, however, marijuana use had increased, particularly among over-25s, the French researchers found.</p>
<p>But in Uruguay, which in July became the first country to legalise marijuana nationwide, &#8220;all the indicators of use have risen&#8221;, including among teens, the study showed.</p>
<p>In the two American states, the legalisation had led to a &#8220;significant&#8221; increase in the number of people admitted to hospital with suspected cannabis poisoning, particularly tourists, it added.</p>
<p>On the economic front, it found that sales of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington had steadily increased, reaching $1 billion a year in each case.</p>
<p>State tax receipts from the sales had surpassed taxes on cigarettes, the report said, while noting that legalisation had not stamped out marijuana trafficking.</p>
<p>In Uruguay, trafficking was driven by the huge gap between demand and legal production, which accounted for just 10 to 20 percent of marijuana use.</p>
<p>In the American states, by contrast, the black market was being fuelled by the higher cost of over-the-counter marijuana, the report concluded.</p>
<p>The researchers acknowledged, however, that legalisation of marijuana had eased the caseload of the police and judiciary.</p>
<p>In France, marijuana use is a crime punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine of 3,750 euros ($4,400). President Emmanuel Macron has proposed easing the penalty to an on-the-spot fine.</p>

		<p><strong>Abstract </strong></p>
<p>IMPORTANCE: </p>
<p>Over the last 25 years, illicit cannabis use and cannabis use disorders have increased among US adults, and 28 states have passed medical marijuana laws (MML). Little is known about MML and adult illicit cannabis use or cannabis use disorders considered over time. </p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: </p>
<p>To present national data on state MML and degree of change in the prevalence of cannabis use and disorders. </p>
<p>DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND SETTING: </p>
<p>Differences in the degree of change between those living in MML states and other states were examined using 3 cross-sectional US adult surveys: the National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (NLAES; 1991-1992), the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; 2001-2002), and the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (NESARC-III; 2012-2013). Early-MML states passed MML between NLAES and NESARC (&#8220;earlier period&#8221;). Late-MML states passed MML between NESARC and NESARC-III (&#8220;later period&#8221;). </p>
<p>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: </p>
<p>Past-year illicit cannabis use and DSM-IV cannabis use disorder. </p>
<p>RESULTS: </p>
<p>Overall, from 1991-1992 to 2012-2013, illicit cannabis use increased significantly more in states that passed MML than in other states (1.4-percentage point more; SE, 0.5; P = .004), as did cannabis use disorders (0.7-percentage point more; SE, 0.3; P = .03). </p>
<p>In the earlier period, illicit cannabis use and disorders decreased similarly in non-MML states and in California (where prevalence was much higher to start with). In contrast, in remaining early-MML states, the prevalence of use and disorders increased.  </p>
<p>Remaining early-MML and non-MML states differed significantly for use (by 2.5 percentage points; SE, 0.9; P = .004) and disorder (1.1 percentage points; SE, 0.5; P = .02). In the later period, illicit use increased by the following percentage points: never-MML states, 3.5 (SE, 0.5); California, 5.3 (SE, 1.0); Colorado, 7.0 (SE, 1.6); other early-MML states, 2.6 (SE, 0.9); and late-MML states, 5.1 (SE, 0.8). Compared with never-MML states, increases in use were significantly greater in late-MML states (1.6-percentage point more; SE, 0.6; P = .01), California (1.8-percentage point more; SE, 0.9; P = .04), and Colorado (3.5-percentage point more; SE, 1.5; P = .03). </p>
<p>Increases in cannabis use disorder, which was less prevalent, were smaller but followed similar patterns descriptively, with change greater than never-MML states in California (1.0-percentage point more; SE, 0.5; P = .06) and Colorado (1.6-percentage point more; SE, 0.8; P = .04). </p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:</p>
<p>Medical marijuana laws appear to have contributed to increased prevalence of illicit cannabis use and cannabis use disorders. State-specific policy changes may also have played a role. While medical marijuana may help some, cannabis-related health consequences associated with changes in state marijuana laws should receive consideration by health care professionals and the public. </p>

		<p>For a long time, those in medicine and the law have been concerned about a link between cannabis and violence. </p>
<p>This has been largely dismissed by the pro-drugs lobby as an association, not proof of a cause. The difference is important to scientific enquiry, as revealed by a telling example given recently by Professor Robert Pickard, a former government advisor. </p>
<p>He says the rise in deaths of hedgehogs on the roads since the end of World War II mirrors the rise in television sales, but it would be daft to suggest that TVs are killing hedgehogs: it’s an association, not a cause. </p>
<p>The evidence linking cannabis and violent crime is compelling: regular use of the drug doubles the risk of a psychotic episode or schizophrenia. And time and again, courts hear how people have become psychotic after smoking cannabis and, in the grips of paranoia and delusions, have murdered someone. The gallery of victims should shame those in the liberal elite who insist there’s no definitive evidence of cause and effect. </p>
<p>But a new study has now provided just this. Researchers followed 1,100 patients for a year after discharge from a psychiatric hospital and those who used cannabis were two-and-a-half times more likely to be violent. </p>
<p>So now there’s clear proof of a causative link, have we witnessed a volte-face from the pro-cannabis lobby? Of course we haven’t, because it was never really about the science. </p>
<p>They want to smoke cannabis, and as soon as science brings doing this into question, they simply brush it aside. Particularly frustrating are the smug, ageing hippies who claim that because they’re still here, it must be fine.  They look back on a youth spent smoking spliffs with pathetic, misplaced nostalgia, and fail to realise that, not only did plenty of people not make it through the Sixties and Seventies unscathed, but the super-strong cannabis of today is almost an entirely different product. </p>
<p>How many more lives must be ruined before the pro-drugs lobby admit they got it wrong? </p>

		<p><strong>Objective: </strong></p>
<p>The authors sought to determine whether cannabis use is associated with a change in the risk of incident nonmedical prescription opioid use and opioid use disorder at 3-year follow-up.</p>
<p><strong>Method: </strong></p>
<p>The authors used logistic regression models to assess prospective associations between cannabis use at wave 1 (2001–2002) and nonmedical prescription opioid use and prescription opioid use disorder at wave 2 (2004–2005) of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Corresponding analyses were performed among adults with moderate or more severe pain and with nonmedical opioid use at wave 1. Cannabis and prescription opioid use were measured with a structured interview (the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule–DSM-IV version). Other covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, anxiety or mood disorders, family history of drug, alcohol, and behavioral problems, and, in opioid use disorder analyses, nonmedical opioid use.</p>
<p><strong>Results: </strong></p>
<p>In logistic regression models, cannabis use at wave 1 was associated with increased incident nonmedical prescription opioid use (odds ratio=5.78, 95% CI=4.23–7.90) and opioid use disorder (odds ratio=7.76, 95% CI=4.95–12.16) at wave 2. These associations remained significant after adjustment for background characteristics (nonmedical opioid use: adjusted odds ratio=2.62, 95% CI=1.86–3.69; opioid use disorder: adjusted odds ratio=2.18, 95% CI=1.14–4.14). Among adults with pain at wave 1, cannabis use was also associated with increased incident nonmedical opioid use (adjusted odds ratio=2.99, 95% CI=1.63–5.47) at wave 2; it was also associated with increased incident prescription opioid use disorder, although the association fell short of significance (adjusted odds ratio=2.14, 95% CI=0.95–4.83). Among adults with nonmedical opioid use at wave 1, cannabis use was also associated with an increase in nonmedical opioid use (adjusted odds ratio=3.13, 95% CI=1.19–8.23).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong></p>
<p>Cannabis use appears to increase rather than decrease the risk of developing nonmedical prescription opioid use and opioid use disorder.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Atlanta, Ga.</strong> (March 14, 2017)—A new report by National Families in Action (NFIA) uncovers and documents how three billionaires, who favour legal recreational marijuana, manipulated the ballot initiative process in 16 U.S. states for more than a decade, convincing voters to legalize medical marijuana. NFIA is an Atlanta-based nonprofit organization, founded in 1977, that has been helping parents prevent children from using alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. NFIA researched and issued the paper to mark its 40th anniversary.</p>
<p>The NFIA study, <span style="text-decoration: underline">Tracking the Money That’s Legalizing Marijuana and Why It Matters</span>, exposes, for the first time, the money trail behind the marijuana legalization effort during a 13-year period. The report lays bare the strategy to use medical marijuana as a runway to legalized recreational pot, describing how financier George Soros, insurance magnate Peter Lewis, and for-profit education baron John Sperling (and groups they and their families fund) systematically chipped away at resistance to marijuana while denying that full legalization was their goal.</p>
<p>The report documents state-by-state financial data, identifying the groups and the amount of money used either to fund or oppose ballot initiatives legalizing medical or recreational marijuana in 16 states. The paper unearths how legalizers fleeced voters and outspent—sometimes by hundreds of times—the people who opposed marijuana.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Tracking the Money That’s Legalizing Marijuana and Why It Matters</span> illustrates that legalizers lied about the health benefits of marijuana, preyed on the hopes of sick people, flouted scientific evidence and advice from the medical community and gutted consumer protections against unsafe, ineffective drugs. And, it proves that once the billionaires achieved their goal of legalizing recreational marijuana (in Colorado and Washington in 2012), they virtually stopped financing medical pot ballot initiatives and switched to financing recreational pot. In 2014 and 2016, they donated $44 million to legalize recreational pot in Alaska, Oregon, California, Arizona, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine. Only Arizona defeated the onslaught (for recreational marijuana).</p>
<p><strong> Unravelling the Legalization Strategy: Behind the Curtain</strong> In 1992, financier George Soros contributed an estimated $15 million to several groups he advised to stop advocating for outright legalization and start working toward what he called more winnable issues such as medical marijuana.</p>
<p>At a press conference in 1993, Richard Cowen, then-director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said, “The key to it [full legalization] is medical access. Because, once you have hundreds of thousands of people using marijuana medically, under medical supervision, the whole scam is going to be blown. The consensus here is that medical marijuana is our strongest suit. It is our point of leverage which will move us toward the legalization of marijuana for personal use.”</p>
<p>Between 1996 and 2009, Soros, Lewis and Sperling contributed 80 percent of the money to medicalize marijuana through state ballot initiatives. Their financial contributions, exceeding $15.7 million (of the $19.5 million total funding), enabled their groups to lie to voters in advertising campaigns, cover up marijuana’s harmful effects, and portray pot as medicine—leading people to believe that the drug is safe and should be legal for any use.</p>
<p>Today, polls show how successful the billionaires and their money have been. In 28 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, voters and, later, legislators have shown they believe marijuana is medicine, even though most of the scientific and medical communities say marijuana is not medicine and should not be legal. While the most recent report, issued by the National Academies of Sciences (NAS), finds that marijuana may alleviate certain kinds of pain, it also finds there is no rigorous, medically acceptable documentation that marijuana is effective in treating any other illness. At the same time, science offers irrefutable evidence that marijuana is addictive, harmful and can hinder brain development in adolescents. At the distribution level, there are no controls on the people who sell to consumers. Budtenders (marijuana bartenders) have no medical or pharmaceutical training or qualifications.</p>
<p>One tactic used by legalizers was taking advantage of voter empathy for sick people, along with the confusion about science and how the FDA approves drugs. A positive finding in a test tube or petri dish is merely a first step in a long, rigorous process leading to scientific consensus about the efficacy of a drug. Scientific proof comes after randomized, controlled clinical trials, and many drugs with promising early stage results never make it through the complex sets of hurdles that prove efficacy and safety. But marijuana legalizers use early promise and thin science to persuade and manipulate empathetic legislators and voters into buying the spin that marijuana is a cure-all.</p>
<p>People who are sick already have access to two FDA-approved drugs, Dronabinol and Nabilone, that are not marijuana, but contain identical copies of some of the components of marijuana. These drugs, available as pills, effectively treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and AIDS wasting. The NAS reviewed 10,700 abstracts of marijuana studies conducted since 1999, finding that these two oral drugs are effective in adults for the conditions described above. An extract containing two marijuana chemicals that is approved in other countries, reduces spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis. But there is no evidence that marijuana treats other diseases, including epilepsy and most of the other medical conditions the states have legalized marijuana to treat. These conditions range from Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Crohn’s disease to Hepatitis-C, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and even sickle cell disease.</p>
<p><strong>Not So Fast – What about the Regulations?</strong></p>
<p>Legalizers also have convinced Americans that unregulated cannabidiol, a marijuana component branded as cannabis oil, CBD, or Charlotte’s Web, cures intractable seizures in children with epilepsy, and polls show some 90 percent of Americans want medical marijuana legalized, particularly for these sick children. In Colorado, the American Epilepsy Society reports that children with epilepsy are receiving unregulated, highly variable artisanal preparations of cannabis oil recommended, in most cases, by doctors with no training in paediatrics, neurology or epilepsy. Young patients have had severe dystonic reactions and other movement disorders, developmental regression, intractable vomiting and worsening seizures that can be so severe that their physicians have to put the child into a coma to get the seizures to stop. Because of these dangerous side effects, not one paediatric neurologist in Colorado, where unregulated cannabidiol is legal, recommends it for these children.</p>
<p>Dr. Sanjay Gupta further clouded the issue when he produced Weed in 2013, a three-part documentary series for CNN on marijuana as medicine. In all three programs, Dr. Gupta promoted CBD oil, the kind the American Epilepsy Society calls artisanal. This is because not one CBD product sold in legal states has been purified to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards, tested, or proven safe and effective. The U.S. Congress and the FDA developed rigid processes to review drugs and prevent medical tragedies such as birth defects caused by thalidomide. These processes have facilitated the greatest advances in medicine in history.</p>
<p>“By end-running the FDA, three billionaires have been willing to wreck the drug approval process that has protected Americans from unsafe, ineffective drugs for more than a century,” said Sue Rusche, president and CEO of National Families in Action and author of the report. “Unsubstantiated claims for the curative powers of marijuana abound.” No one can be sure of the purity, content, side effects or potential of medical marijuana to cause cancer or any other disease. When people get sick from medical marijuana, there are no uniform mechanisms to recall products causing the harm. Some pot medicines contain no active ingredients. Others contain contaminants. “Sick people, especially children, suffer while marijuana medicine men make money at their expense,” added Ms. Rusche.</p>
<p><strong>Marijuana Industry – Taking a Page from the Tobacco Industry </strong>The paper draws a parallel between the marijuana and tobacco industries, both built with the knowledge that a certain percentage of users will become addicted and guaranteed lifetime customers. Like tobacco, legalized marijuana will produce an unprecedented array of new health, safety and financial consequences to Americans and their children.</p>
<p>“Americans learned the hard way about the tragic effects of tobacco and the deceptive practices of the tobacco industry. Making another addictive drug legal unleashes a commercial business that is unable to resist the opportunity to make billions of dollars on the back of human suffering, unattained life goals, disease, and death,” said Ms. Rusche. “If people genuinely understood that marijuana can cause cognitive, safety and mental health problems, is addictive, and that addiction rates may be three times higher than reported, neither voters nor legislators would legalize pot.” NDPA recommends readers to read the whole report Tracking the Money That’s Legalizing Marijuana and Why It Matters</p>

<p>Trials on mice showed seizures can be induced by both THC &#8211; which causes the &#8216;high&#8217; in marijuana, and JWH-018 &#8211; the main component of spice.  The rodents also suffered from a shortness of breath and impaired walking after being given both compounds, the scientists discovered. </p>
<p>Japanese researchers warned the results should act as a wake-up call, given how widely high-potency and synthetic weed is used. </p>
<p>The findings contradicts pro-cannabis campaigners who have long argued that cannabis can help to tackle seizures and highlighted research which shows weed can prevent and control seizures in epileptic patients. </p>
<p>However, lead researcher Dr Olga Malyshevskaya, based at the University of Tsukuba, said the latest findings show cannabis is not a soft drug and warned of its dangers.  </p>
<p>She said: &#8216;Our study is quite important. Unaware of the particularly severe effect by those cannabinoids, people see marijuana as a soft drug, without dangerous health effects.&#8217; </p>
<p>She added: &#8216;It is critically important for health-care professionals and policy makers to be aware of the serious adverse effects, as shown in this report.  Clinicians in the emergency departments should always suspect seizure activity in patients who have a history of cannabinoid intoxication. </p>
<p>WHAT IS THC? </p>
<p>THC is found in all forms of cannabis, but is abundant in skunk &#8211; a super-strength form of the drug that dominates Britain&#8217;s illegal market.  </p>
<p>Some 80 per cent of what is available on the streets is believed to be skunk, which is created  by growers aiming to make the most potent strain of the drug possible in order to maximise their profits. </p>
<p>They remove high amounts of CBD from the plant, allowing the modified herb to contain only THC. It is unsure how much THC was in the strain of cannabis used in the new study.  </p>
<p>Over the years, a host of previous research has pointed to a link between the popular recreational drug and mental health conditions.  Last October, University College London researchers found that skunk may be twice as addictive as normal strains of cannabis.  </p>
<p>Similar health concerns have been raised about synthetic cannabis spice, which can slump users and turn them into &#8216;zombies&#8217;. </p>
<p>It was previously known as a legal high before it was banned last year following a surge in its use. Now it has reached epidemic levels in prison.  </p>
<p>&#8216;The number of clinical cases involving marijuana intoxication has been steadily increasing due to increase in cannabis potency over the last two decades.&#8217;  </p>
<p>What do other experts think?  </p>
<p>Ian Hamilton, a cannabis researcher at York University, cautioned the results, which are published in Scientific Reports. </p>
<p>He told MailOnline: &#8216;We don&#8217;t know if people who use cannabis are using something as potent as this.&#8217;   For the study, researchers measured the brain activity of the mice after giving them both compounds and recorded them. </p>
<p>Research that claims to show cannabis can control seizures </p>
<p> The findings contradict a body of research which shows weed can prevent and control seizures in epileptic patients.   Campaigners have long argued that cannabis has the opposite effect to the new findings and can help to tackle seizures. </p>
<p>Researchers have previously suggested that CBD &#8211; the other compound in cannabis which produces no &#8216;high&#8217;, binds to a receptor in the brain that calms down the electrical activity in the brain which causes a seizure.  </p>
<p>First Briton to be prescribed liquid cannabis oil on the NHS </p>
<p>Their case was strengthened when an 11-year-old on the brink of death from a severe form of epilepsy made an &#8216;incredible&#8217; recovery from taking marijuana. </p>
<p>Billy Caldwell, from Castlederg, Northern Ireland, made headlines in April when he became the first Briton to be prescribed such a drug on the NHS. </p>
<p>And 10 months since he was first given the liquid cannabis oil, he hasn&#8217;t had any seizures. He used to suffer up to 100 a day.  </p>
<p>THE MAN WHO SUFFERS SEIZURES FROM SYNTHETIC CANNABIS </p>
<p>The news comes just a week after DailyMail.com reported on a disturbing video which shows a man from Des Moines, Iowa, having a seizure as an effect of years smoking synthetic marijuana. </p>
<p>Coby O&#8217;Brien-Emerick, 27, has experienced chronic seizures every three months for the past five years, putting him in the hospital for weeks on end. </p>
<p>In the video uploaded in December, Coby is seen on the floor convulsing for about nine minutes while paramedics are being called. </p>
<p>The father-of-two told Dailymail.com he asked for his seizure to be recorded in order to understand the severity of it.  </p>
<p>The video was posted to YouTube by his mother-in-law to warn others about the dangerous effects of smoking synthetic marijuana . </p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">2015 will be remembered as the year legalization hit bumps most supporters never anticipated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">For pro-health advocates that oppose marijuana legalization, it was a year of fantastic victories! Here are the top 10:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> <strong>10. Big Marijuana is Real — and People are Writing About It.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">When we started talking about Big Marijuana in 2013, many people laughed. Could marijuana even be compared with Big Tobacco in any credible way? But now, that’s ancient history. Several articles &#8211; even in legalization-friendly blogs<a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/2/9831980/marijuana-legalization-industry-business"> like this one</a> &#8211; mention the term. And the term is not just rhetoric — the most senior federal legalization lobbyist in the country <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/marijuana-legalization-2015-major-pot-activist-quits-marijuana-policy-project-says-2203385">resigned in protest</a> because, in his words, “industry was taking over the legalization movement.” Not only was that heroic of him, it was historic for us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> <strong>9. Continuing Positive Press Coverage of Groups Opposing Legalization. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">With the exception of some very pro-pot columnists, this year represented one in which our side was represented just a little bit better than in the past. A profile of <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/kevin-sabet-marijuana-movements-biggest-threat-can-he-really-stop-big-pot-2214390">SAM was featured in the International Business Times</a>, and<a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/3/20/8257631/kevin-sabet-marijuana-legalization"> other articles </a>continued to broadcast our message to new audiences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">With the hiring of a new Communications Director in 2016, you can bet we won’t let up on this next year.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> <strong><br />
8. Several States Resisted Full-Blown Legalization. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">We entered 2014 after setbacks in Alaska and Oregon; but we stuck to winning messages and formed coalitions in a bloc of New England states that were all under attack in the early part of 2015. From Maine to Massachusetts to New Hampshire to Rhode Island, our partners and affiliates fought back —- and not one state legalized via legislature as the legalizers had promised. We’ll be taking this momentum into 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> <strong>7. Lawyering Up.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong> </strong>Many of our friends made strong statements in court — “Colorado and other states cannot legalize in the face of federal law,” they argue. Of course we know they are right, and we know that regardless of legal outcomes the statement they sent was loud and clear. (We’re also happy that the Justice Department, in its opposition to the suit, solely argued against it on procedural grounds — <a href="https://learnaboutsam.org/press-statement-on-doj-amicus-brief-to-supreme-court/">they did not substantively come out in favor of legalization </a>to the Solicitor General). The plaintiff’s bar should take notice—just like Big Tobacco became a big target for lawsuits, Big Marijuana and those who sell the drug will, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> <strong>6. Marijuana Stores Banned in California, Washington, Colorado, Oregon, Michigan, and Elsewhere. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Despite legalization in some states, we know that local ordinances are one of the key strategies to keeping marijuana out of communities. The majority of towns in most weed-friendly states have indeed banned stores altogether. <a href="http://michiganradio.org/post/detroit-puts-zoning-restrictions-medical-pot-dispensaries#stream/0">Even in Detroit, up to half of Detroit’s roughly 150 medical marijuana dispensaries could close following a Detroit City Council vote to approve a restrictive zoning ordinance. We will keep pushing hard for more bans in 2016.</a></span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> <strong><br />
5. Legalizers Made No Gains in Congress This Year</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> For the past decade, it seemed that every year we lost a little more in Congress. Not in 2015. Despite the most aggressive lobbying effort yet by pro-marijuana folks, they made no progress on key provisions:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> · They wanted to give tax breaks to pot shops—just like Big Tobacco lobbies to lower taxes on cigarettes.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">They wanted to allow pot businesses to leverage Wall Street money through the banking system.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">They wanted to stop the Justice Department from enforcing the law in states with legalized recreational marijuana.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">They wanted to give pot to our most vulnerable citizens to “treat” PTSD — even though science says marijuana makes PTSD, as well as other mental illness, worse.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">They wanted Washington, DC, to become a mecca for Big Marijuana.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><a href="https://learnaboutsam.org/victory-in-congress-lawmakers-reject-big-marijuanas-agenda/">And we won &#8211; on every issue.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> <strong>4. Continued Support from ONDCP, DEA, and NIDA</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">2015 was a transitional year for key federal drug policy agencies. A new ONDCP Director was appointed — and even though we are still waiting for the Obama Administration to enforce federal law, it is clear where Director Botticelli’s heart is. Right after getting into office, the Director sat down with me for a one-to-one on-the-record interview where he blasted legal pot. And only a few weeks ago, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-a-new-direction-on-drugs/">he was featured on 60 Minutes</a> talking about the harms of marijuana and the harms of the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Additionally, we saw the appointment of a new DEA Administrator — this time from the FBI. Administrator Rosenberg has been an excellent leader by moving to support legitimate medical research over faux claims of “medical” marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> And we continue to receive support from NIDA Director Nora Volkow, who headlined SAM’s summit last year, for her unwavering support of public health above profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> <strong>3. Real Progress on Researching the Medical Components of Marijuana.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong> </strong>I’m proud that <a href="https://learnaboutsam.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SAM-MMJ-RECOMMENDATION-REPORT-FINAL.pdf">SAM took a bold stand this year to defend</a> the legitimate research of medical components of marijuana. And our ground-breaking report paid off. The federal government has already adopted two of the report’s provisions — <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/43418/title/Obama-Administration-Eases-Marijuana-Research-Requirements/">eliminating the Public Health Service review </a>and <a href="http://www.dea.gov/divisions/hq/2015/hq122315.shtml">getting rid of onerous CBD handling requirements</a>. We will continue to fight for legitimate marijuana research, and to separate it from faux medicine-by-ballot-initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> <strong>2. No States Legalized “Medical” Marijuana in 2015.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This is a big one, given where the country is on the “medical” marijuana issue. No state legalized the drug for medical purposes this year, despite several tries in key states. Even in Georgia, where legalizers have been emboldened by a few pot-friendly legislators, a government-convened panel voted to follow science and impose sensible restrictions on the drug. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> <strong>1. Ohio! </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Of course, the victory in Ohio tops the field. Despite being outspent 12-to-1, our affiliates and partners <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/04/ohios-failed-marijuana-bill-has-been-a-godsend-for-critics-of-legal-pot/">brought us a huge victory in November.</a> We plan to build on this for 2016, but we need your help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> Despite the nonstop talking point of “inevitability,” we know that the 8% of Americans who use pot don’t speak for 92% of Americans that don’t want to see Big Tobacco 2.0, don’t want to worry about another drug impairing drivers on the road, and don’t want to think about keeping things like innocuous-looking “pot gummy bears” away from their kids. We know that the pot lobby will work hard for things like not only full-blown legalization in several more states next year, but also things like on-site pot smoking “bars” (they are really proposing these in Alaska and Colorado as we speak) and an expansion of pot edibles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"> In 2016, let’s nip Big Marijuana in the bud.</span></p>

        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Legalisation of cannabis is likely to lack priority for this new government.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is one benefit to MMP, it is that the whackier campaign ideas tend to perish in the coalition negotiation process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That hasn&#8217;t entirely been the case this time, the worst example being the Green Party&#8217;s promise to initiate a referendum on the subject of legalising cannabis (by 2020).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This would seem to be a case of a party formulating policy in the hope that it will garner votes as opposed to genuinely believing it will be beneficial. That view is reinforced by Green leader James Shaw&#8217;s assurance last week that he had never smoked cannabis, adding the illuminating comment, &#8220;It isn&#8217;t good for you, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>&#8220;We know that cannabis is a carcinogenic, as is tobacco. Unlike tobacco, however, it is also linked, beyond dispute, with mental illness and poor academic achievement.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Too right it isn&#8217;t. There is enough evidence to support that to stupefy an entire nation, which makes it all the more extraordinary that he would not only propose a referendum in the first place, but would stick to his guns when it came to striking a deal with Labour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the more extraordinary because Mr Shaw&#8217;s party is one of the leading lights in the drive to make New Zealand tobacco-free by 2025. (Presumably the term smoke-free is now redundant).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If all goes according to his plan, a substance that harms the physical health of the user will disappear just in time to be replaced by another substance that does even more damage, physically, emotionally and intellectually, than tobacco ever has.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know that cannabis is a carcinogenic, as is tobacco. Unlike tobacco, however, it is also linked, beyond dispute, with mental illness and poor academic achievement. From there it can be held accountable for reducing the user&#8217;s ability to find employment, and everything that goes with that, including poverty, for themselves and their dependents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The drive for legalisation has taken a turn (for the worse) this time around because of strident appeals to recognise its medicinal benefits. It might well dull pain &#8211; it certainly dulls most of the user&#8217;s senses &#8211; but there is a undoubtedly deliberate blurring of the lines by the drug&#8217;s supporters between medicinal cannabis, which does not include its mind-altering properties, and the &#8216;benefits&#8217; to be gained by allowing its cultivation/possession and consumption in the traditional manner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People have long waxed eloquent about cannabis as a pain killer, usually from the dock as they are in the process of being sentenced for growing the stuff. If personal experience of that is anything to go by, its fans tend to show all the signs of long-term use, which might make them happy but has reduced their role in society to that of passengers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It might well be true that cannabis does not represent any great threat to the physical or mental health of a middle-aged dope smoker who indulges on an occasional basis. The same cannot be said for those who start young, and there, Mr Shaw, lies the rub.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have been told for years, most often by the National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (Norml &#8211; there&#8217;s an oxymoron for you) that legalisation would of course need to be accompanied by strict controls that would keep it out of the hands of young people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That assurance has been given to the writer on numerous occasions, but no one has ever been able to explain how any such measures would stand any chance of success, given our experience with tobacco and alcohol.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Neither of those substances may be legally purchased or used by minors, but both are. No one in this country has yet been able to devise controls that prevent that, and the same, inevitably, will apply to cannabis. Prove to us that you have cracked that, Mr Shaw, and people might start listening to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best reason for not legalising cannabis was offered to this newspaper some years ago by a teacher at Kaitaia College. He said the college was home to any number of bright, determined, ambitious young people who knew what they wanted to do with their lives, and had mapped out exactly how they were going to achieve their ambitions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They knew that even a minor cannabis conviction would nobble those ambitions, and for that reason alone wouldn&#8217;t touch the stuff with a barge pole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No one the writer knows has ever come up with a better reason for not legalising it. And no one will. If it is legalised future generations of bright, ambitious young people will assuredly dabble in it, to their (and our) cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if they don&#8217;t succumb to regular use it will rob them, to some degree, of their potential, to a far greater degree than flirting with alcohol or tobacco ever would.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We don&#8217;t hear Mr Shaw, or anyone else, suggesting that our children should have greater access than they already do to alcohol and tobacco, for good reason. How they can be prepared to countenance access to cannabis defies explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps Mr Shaw&#8217;s political interest in this issue outweighs any concern he might have for future generations. Perhaps the legalising of cannabis has such appeal to his voter base that he can accept the inevitable collateral damage. Hopefully he is in a very small minority, and will remain so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And don&#8217;t buy the hoary old story that our prisons are full of people who wouldn&#8217;t be there if cannabis was legal. Those who insist that this is true have either been doing too much personal research into the &#8216;benefits&#8217; of sucking on cannabis cigarette all day or are deliberately trying to deceive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No one is in jail in this country today purely because they have been caught using cannabis. One or two might be there because they were caught growing or dealing it on a substantial scale, but possession of cannabis, whatever the law might say, is no longer an imprisonable offence in this country, and hasn&#8217;t been for a very long time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There will be some who are in jail on convictions that include possession of cannabis, but it won&#8217;t have been the drug that put them behind bars. They will have offended in other ways. To say that people are in jail because of personal possession is a blatant lie.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some elements of the current debate are certainly worth pursuing, including that drug addiction in general should be regarded as a health issue rather than a criminal matter. And there is no doubt that drug treatment facilities are woefully inadequate. But again, this is where the pro-cannabis logic collapses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know the harm cannabis does; we know it leads to dependence on much harsher chemical substances; we know that people who become addicted, to whatever substance, are unlikely to get the help they need to get off it. And we know that the damage done, by cannabis and other drugs, is permanent. Dead brain cells don&#8217;t grow back.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet here we are talking about legalising it. It makes no sense whatsoever to even consider it. A handful of people might genuinely believe that it will ease their pain, or, in medical form, will reduce the severity of some far from common conditions (again, the use of medical marijuana is a separate issue), but legalising cannabis for all and sundry will not benefit society in any imaginable way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There can be absolutely no question that legalising cannabis will, in fact, do enormous harm, and any politician who is unaware of that, or is prepared to trade that harm for electoral success, has no place in Parliament.</p>

        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>There is current research into the probable genotoxicity of marijuana and this has been likened to the harm to the foetus in the womb from the drug Thalidomide in the 1960’s.</p>
<p>In the annals of modern medicine, it was a horror story of international scope: thousands of babies dead in the womb and at least 10,000 others in 46 countries born with severe deformities. Some of the children were missing limbs. Others had arms and legs that resembled a seal’s flippers. In many cases, eyes, ears and other organs and tissues failed to develop properly. The cause, scientists discovered by late 1961, was thalidomide, a drug that, during four years of commercial sales in countries from Germany to Australia, was marketed to pregnant women as a miracle cure for morning sickness and insomnia.</p>
<p>The tragedy was largely averted in the United States, with much credit due to Frances Oldham Kelsey, a medical officer at the Food and Drug Administration in Washington, who raised concerns about thalidomide before its effects were conclusively known. For a critical 19-month period, she fastidiously blocked its approval while drug company officials maligned her as a bureaucratic nitpicker. Dr. Kelsey, a physician and pharmacologist later lauded as a heroine of the federal workforce, died Aug. 7 at her daughter’s home in London, Ontario. She was 101. Her daughter, Christine Kelsey, confirmed her death but did not cite a specific cause.</p>
<p>Dr. Kelsey did not single-handedly uncover thalidomide’s hazards. Clinical investigators and health authorities around the world played an important role, as did several of her FDA peers. But because of her tenacity and clinical training, she became the central figure in the thalidomide episode.</p>
<p>In July 1962, The Washington Post directed national attention on the matter — and on Dr. Kelsey — with a front-page article reporting that her “scepticism and stubbornness &#8230; prevented what could have been an appalling American tragedy.” [From 1962: ‘Heroine’ of FDA keeps bad drug off the market].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The global thalidomide calamity precipitated legislation signed by President John F. Kennedy in October 1962 that substantially strengthened the FDA’s authority over drug testing. The new regulations, still in force, required pharmaceutical companies to conduct phased clinical trials, obtain informed consent from participants in drug testing, and warn the FDA of adverse effects, and granted the FDA with important controls over prescription-drug advertising.</p>
<p>As the new federal law was being hammered out, Kennedy rushed to include Dr. Kelsey in a previously scheduled White House award ceremony honouring influential civil servants, including an architect of NASA’s manned spaceflight program.“In a way, they tied her to the moonshot in showing what government scientists were capable of,” said Stephen Fried, a journalist who investigated the drug industry in the book “Bitter Pills.” “It was an act of incredible daring and bravery to say we need to wait longer before we expose the American people to this drug.”</p>
<p>Dr. Kelsey became, Fried said, “the most famous government regulator in American history.”</p>
<p>‘I was the newest person there and pretty green’</p>
<p>Dr. Kelsey had landed at the FDA in August 1960, one of seven full-time medical officers hired to review about 300 human drug applications per year.The number of women pursuing careers in science was minuscule, but Dr. Kelsey had long been comfortable in male-dominated environments. Growing up in Canada, she spent part of her childhood in an otherwise all-boys private school. She had two daughters while shouldering the demands of medical school in the late 1940s.</p>
<p>In Washington, she joined a corps of reform-minded scientists who, although not yet empowered by the 1962 law that required affirmative FDA approval of any new drug, demanded strong evidence of effectiveness before giving their imprimatur.At the time, a drug could go on the market 60 days after the manufacturer filed an application with the FDA. If the medical officer determined that the submission was incomplete, the drug company could provide additional information, and the clock would start anew.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, pharmaceutical drug companies commonly supplied doctors with new drugs and encouraged them to test the product on patients, an uncontrolled and dangerous practice that relied almost entirely on anecdotal evidence. Thalidomide, which was widely marketed as a sedative as well as a treatment for pregnancy-related nausea during the first trimester of pregnancy, had proven wildly popular in Europe and a boon for its German manufacturer, Chemie Grünenthal.</p>
<p>By the fall of 1960, a Cincinnati-based drug company, William S. Merrell, had licensed the drug and began to distribute it under the trade name Kevadon to 1,200 U.S. doctors in advance of what executives anticipated would be its quick approval by the FDA.The government later estimated that more than 2.5 million tablets were given to about 20,000 patients, several hundred of whom were pregnant.</p>
<p>The Merrell application landed on Dr. Kelsey’s desk within weeks of her arrival at the agency. “I was the newest person there and pretty green,” she later said in an FDA oral history, “so my supervisors decided, ‘Well, this is a very easy one. There will be no problems with sleeping pills.’ ” Immediately the application alarmed her. Despite what she called the company’s “quite fulsome” claims, the absorption and toxicity studies were so incomplete as to be almost meaningless.</p>
<p>Dr. Kelsey rejected the application numerous times and requested more data. Merrell representatives, who had large potential profits riding on the application, began to complain to her bosses and show up at her office, with respected clinical investigators in tow, to protest the hold-up. Dr. Kelsey’s FDA superiors backed her as she conducted her research. By February 1961, she had found more evidence to support her suspicions, including a letter in the British Medical Journal by an English doctor who reported that his patients on thalidomide experienced a painful “tingling” in the arms and feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Kelsey also discovered that, despite warnings of side effects printed on British and German drug labels, Merrell had not notified the FDA of any adverse reactions.  Another reason for her concern was that the company had apparently done no studies on pregnant animals. At the time, a prevailing view among doctors held that the placental barrier protected the foetus from what Dr. Kelsey once called “the indiscretions of the mother,” such as abuse of alcohol, tobacco or illegal drugs. Earlier in her career, however, she had investigated the ways in which drugs did in fact pass through the placenta from mother to baby.</p>
<p>While Dr. Kelsey stood her ground on Kevadon, infant deaths and deformities were occurring at an alarming rate in places where thalidomide had been sold. The development of seal-like flippers, a condition known as phocomelia that previously affected an estimated 1 in 4 million infants, began to crop up by the dozens in many countries.</p>
<p>Clinical investigators, because of a variety of complications including spotty tracking systems, only belatedly made the link to thalidomide.  Grünenthal began pulling the drug from the market in Germany in late 1961. Health authorities in other countries issued warnings. Merrell waited until March 1962 to withdraw its U.S. application. By then, at least 17 babies were born in the United States with thalidomide-related defects, according to the FDA</p>
<p><strong>Influence beyond thalidomide</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Kelsey might have remained an anonymous bureaucrat if not for the front-page story in The Post. The newspaper had received a tip about her from staffers working for Sen. Estes Kefauver, a Tennessee Democrat who had been stalled in his years-long battle with the pharmaceutical industry to bolster the country’s drug laws. The coverage of Dr. Kelsey gave her — and Kefauver — a lift. As thousands of grateful letters flowed in to Dr. Kelsey from the public, the proposed legislation became hard to ignore or to water down. The new law was widely known as the Kefauver-Harris Amendments.</p>
<p>“She had a huge effect on the regulations adopted in the 1960s to help create the modern clinical trial system,” said Daniel Carpenter, a professor of government at Harvard University and the author of “Reputation and Power,” a definitive history of the FDA. “She may have had a bigger effect after thalidomide than before.”</p>
<p>In 1963, Dr. Kelsey was named chief of the FDA’s investigational drug branch. Four years later, she was named director of the new Office of Scientific Investigations, a position she held until 1995.  She spent another decade, until her retirement at 90, working at the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. In that role, she advised the director of its compliance office on scientific and medical issues and analyzed historical drug review issues.</p>
<p>According to historians of the FDA, she was instrumental in establishing the institutional review boards — a cornerstone of modern clinical drug development — that were created after abusive drug testing trials were exposed in prisons, hospitals and nursing homes. For decades, Dr. Kelsey played a critical role at the agency in enforcing federal regulations for drug development — protocols that were credited with forcing more rigorous standards around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Name mistaken for a man’s</strong></p>
<p>Frances Kathleen Oldham was born near Cobble Hill, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, on July 24, 1914. Her father was a retired British army officer, and her mother came from a prosperous Scottish family.  The young “Frankie,” as she was called, grew up exploring the woods and shorelines, sometimes bringing home frogs for dissection. At McGill University in Montreal, she studied pharmacology — the effects of drugs on people — and received a bachelor’s degree in 1934 and a master’s degree in 1935.</p>
<p>A McGill professor urged her to apply for a research assistant job at the University of Chicago, where pharmacology professor Eugene Geiling accepted her without an interview. Geiling, who had mistaken the names Frances for the masculine Francis, addressed her by mail as “Mr. Oldham.”</p>
<p>“When a woman took a job in those days, she was made to feel as if she was depriving a man of the ability to support his wife and child,” Dr. Kelsey told the New York Times in 2010. “But my professor said: ‘Don’t be stupid. Accept the job, sign your name and put “Miss” in brackets afterward.’ ”</p>
<p>In Chicago, she helped Geiling investigate the 107 deaths that occurred nationwide in 1937 from the newly marketed liquid form of sulfanilamide, a synthetic antibacterial drug used to treat streptococcal infections. In tablet form, it had been heralded as a wonder-drug of the age, but it tasted unpleasant.Because the drug was not soluble in water or alcohol, the chief chemist of its manufacturer, S.E. Massengill Co. of Bristol, Tenn., dissolved the sulfanilamide with an industrial substance that was a chemical relative of antifreeze. He then added cherry flavouring and pink colouring to remedy the taste and appearance.</p>
<p>Massengill rushed the new elixir to market without adequately testing its safety. Many who took the medicine — including a high number of children — suffered an agonizing death.  At the time, the FDA’s chief mandate, stemming from an obsolete 1906 law, was food safety. At the agency’s request, Geiling joined the Elixir Sulfanilamide investigation and put Dr. Kelsey to work on animal testing of the drug. She recalled observing rats as they “shrivelled up and died.”</p>
<p>Amid national outrage over Elixir Sulfanilamide, Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, legislation that vastly expanded federal regulatory oversight over drugs and set a new benchmark for drug safety before marketing. Massengill’s owner ultimately was fined a maximum penalty of $26,000 for mislabelling and misbranding; by technical definition, an elixir contains alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>‘We need to take precautions’</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Kelsey received a doctorate from Chicago in 1938, then joined the faculty. In 1943, she wed a pharmacology colleague, Fremont Ellis Kelsey.  After graduating from Chicago’s medical school in 1950, Frances Kelsey taught pharmacology at the University of South Dakota medical school and was a fill-in doctor at practices throughout the state. She also became a U.S. citizen before arriving in Washington in 1960 when her husband was hired by the National Institutes of Health. He died in 1966 after a heart attack.</p>
<p>Survivors include their daughters, Susan Duffield of Shelton, Wash., and Christine Kelsey of London, Ontario; a sister; and two grandchildren. Dr. Kelsey moved to Ontario from suburban Maryland in 2014.</p>
<p>Babies who suffered from the effects of thalidomide and survived grew up with a range of impairment. Some required lifelong home care. Others held jobs and were not severely hindered by their disabilities. Many legal settlements were reached between drug companies and the victims of thalidomide, and new claims continue to surface. Grünenthal formally apologized to victims of thalidomide in 2012.</p>
<p>The drug, however, never disappeared entirely. Researchers have investigated thalidomide’s effects on H.I.V. and Crohn’s disease and have conducted clinical trials for on its use for rheumatoid arthritis and macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness.</p>
<p>In 1998, the FDA approved the drug for the treatment of lesions from leprosy. In 2006, thalidomide was cleared for use with the medicine dexamethasone for certain cases of multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow.</p>
<p>The agency enforced strict safeguards, including pregnancy testing, for such new uses. “We need to take precautions,” Dr. Kelsey told an interviewer in in 2001, “because people forget very soon.”</p>

		<p>Researchers at Western University have found a way to use pharmaceuticals to reverse the negative psychiatric effects of THC, the psychoactive chemical found in marijuana. Chronic adolescent marijuana use has previously been linked to the development of psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, in adulthood. But until now, researchers were unsure of what exactly was happening in the brain to cause this to occur.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is important about this study is that not only have we identified a specific mechanism in the prefrontal cortex for some of the mental health risks associated with adolescent marijuana use, but we have also identified a mechanism to reverse those risks,&#8221; said Steven Laviolette, professor at Western&#8217;s Schulich School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry.</p>
<p>In a study published online today in Scientific Reports the researchers demonstrate that adolescent THC exposure modulates the activity of a neurotransmitter called GABA in the prefrontal cortex region of the brain. The team, led by Laviolette and post-doctoral fellow Justine Renard, looked specifically at GABA because of its previously shown clinical association with schizophrenia.</p>
<p>&#8220;GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and plays a crucial role in regulating the excitatory activity in the frontal cortex, so if you have less GABA, your neuronal systems become hyperactive leading to behavioural changes consistent with schizophrenia,&#8221; said Renard.</p>
<p>The study showed that the reduction of GABA as a result of THC exposure in adolescence caused the neurons in adulthood to not only be hyperactive in this part of the brain, but also to be out of synch with each other, demonstrated by abnormal oscillations called &#8216;gamma&#8217; waves. This loss of GABA in the cortex caused a corresponding hyperactive state in the brain&#8217;s dopamine system, which is commonly observed in schizophrenia.</p>
<p>By using drugs to activate GABA in a rat model of schizophrenia, the team was able to reverse the neuronal and behavioural effects of the THC and eliminate the schizophrenia-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Laviolette says this finding is especially important given the impending legalization of marijuana in Canada. &#8220;What this could mean is that if you are going to be using marijuana, in a recreational or medicinal way, you can potentially combine it with compounds that boost GABA to block the negative effects of THC.&#8221;</p>
<p>The research team says the next steps will examine how combinations of cannabinoid chemicals with compounds that can boost the brains GABA system may serve as more effective and safer treatments for a variety of mental health disorders, such as addiction, depression and anxiety.</p>

        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>by  Elizabeth Stuyt, MD</p>
<p>For the past 27 years, working as an addiction psychiatrist, I have struggled with big industries that push their products more for their financial gain rather than the best interests of the clients they serve. The most disconcerting piece occurs when physicians or other treatment providers or governmental entities appear to be influenced by big industry, touting the party line and minimizing any downsides to the product. I have experienced this with the tobacco industry, the pharmaceutical industry and now with the marijuana industry.</p>
<p>It is clear to me that wherever it happens, the push to legalize medical marijuana is simply a back-door effort, by industry, to legalize retail marijuana. However, the lack of any regulations on the potency of THC in marijuana or marijuana products in Colorado has allowed the cannabis industry to increase the potency of THC to astronomical proportions, resulting in a burgeoning public health crisis.</p>
<p>The potency of THC in currently available marijuana has quadrupled since the mid-1990s. The marijuana of the 1980s had &lt;2% THC, 4.5% in 1997, 8.5% in 2006 and by 2015 the average potency of THC in the flower was 17%, with concentrated products averaging 62% THC.</p>
<p>Sadly, the cannabidiol (CBD) concentrations in currently available marijuana have remained the same or decreased. CBD is the component of marijuana that appears to block or ameliorate the effects of THC. Plants that are bred to produce high concentrations of THC cannot simultaneously produce high CBD. Higher-potency THC has been achieved by genetically engineering plants to product more THC and then preventing pollination so that the plant puts more energy into producing cannabinoids rather than seeds. This type of cannabis is referred to as sinsemilla (Spanish for without seed). (It has also been referred to as “skunk” due to its strong smell.)</p>
<p>In my view, this is no different than when the tobacco industry increased the potency of nicotine by genetically engineering tobacco plants to produce more nicotine and then used additives like ammonia to increase the absorption of nicotine. Industry’s efforts to increase the potency of an addictive substance seem to be done purely with the idea of addicting as many people as possible to guarantee continued customers. This certainly worked for the tobacco industry. And we have increasing evidence that high potency THC cannabis use is associated with an increased severity of cannabis dependence, especially in young people.12</p>
<p>Although marijuana has been used for thousands of years for various medical conditions, we have no idea if the benefit comes from the THC or CBD or one of the other multiple cannabinoids present in marijuana, or a combination. And we have no idea how much is needed or how often. Most of the research indicates that it is likely the CBD that is more helpful but we obviously need research on this. There is no evidence that increasing the potency of THC has any medical benefits. In fact, a study on the benefits of smoked cannabis on pain actually demonstrated that too high a dose of THC can cause hyperalgesia – similar to what is seen with high dose opiates – meaning that the person becomes more sensitive to pain with continued use. They found that 2% THC had no effect on pain, 4% THC had some beneficial effects on chronic pain and 8% resulted in hyperalgesia.3</p>
<p>The discovery of the “active component” in marijuana that makes it so desirable is a fairly recent phenomenon. THC and CBD were first discovered in 1963 in Israel.4</p>
<p>Because cannabis was made a DEA schedule I drug in 1970, very little research has been done on cannabis in the United States and most of the indications for medical marijuana have very little good research backing up the use. The chemical that is made by the body and fits the receptor which accommodates THC was discovered in 1992.5</p>
<p>The researcher named the chemical anandamide which means “supreme joy” in Sanskrit.  However, it turns out that the endocannabinoid system plays a very significant role in brain development that occurs during childhood and adolescence. It controls glutamate and GABA homeostasis and plays a role in strengthening and pruning synaptic connections in the prefrontal motor cortex. The consequences of using the high potency THC products during this period, especially without the protective benefits of CBD, are multifaceted and include disturbance of the endocannabinoid system, which can result in impaired cognitive development, lower IQ and increased risk of psychosis.</p>
<p>There is also evidence that marijuana use contributes to anxiety and depression. A very large prospective study out of Australia tracked 1600 girls for 7 years and found that those who used marijuana every day were 5 times more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety than non-users.6</p>
<p>Teenage girls who used the drug a least once a week were twice as likely to develop depression as those who did not use. In this study, cannabis use prior to age 15 also increased the risk of developing schizophrenia symptoms.</p>
<p>While there definitely are people who can use marijuana responsibly without any untoward effects, similar to how some people can drink alcohol responsibly and not have any problems, there are people who are very sensitive to the effects of THC, and its use can precipitate psychosis. The higher the potency of THC the more likely this may happen and we have no idea how to predict who will be affected. In one of the first double blind randomized placebo controlled trials on smoked cannabis (maximum of 8% THC) for the treatment of pain, a cannabis naïve participant had a psychotic reaction to the marijuana in the study and this then required that all future study participants have some experience with smoking marijuana.7</p>
<p>This kind of makes it difficult to have “blind” unbiased participants.</p>
<p>A 2015 study out of London analyzed 780 people ages 18-65, 410 with first episode psychosis and 370 healthy controls, and found that users of high potency (“skunk-like”) cannabis (THC &gt; 15%) are three times as likely to have a psychotic episode as people who never use cannabis, and the risk is fivefold in people who smoke this form of the drug every day.89 There was no association of psychosis with THC levels &lt; 5%. Most of the marijuana in the U.S. is of the high-THC variety. Many retailers in Colorado sell strains of weed that contain 25 percent THC or more.</p>
<p>Sadly, Colorado has now joined several other states in approving PTSD as an indication for the use of medical marijuana. Marijuana does not “treat” PTSD any more than benzodiazepines or opiates “treat” PTSD. All these addictive drugs do is mask the symptoms, allowing the person to continue life unaffected by the memory of the trauma. However, the psychological trauma is never resolved and the individual has to continue to use the substance in order to cope. This sets the individual up for the development of addiction to the substance or the use of other addictive substances. There is absolutely no good research to support the use of marijuana for PTSD, and there is observational data that this would be a bad idea unless this use was supported by a lot more (and better-designed) longitudinal research.</p>
<p>In an excellent longitudinal, observational study from 1992 to 2011, 2,276 Veterans admitted to specialized VA treatment programs for PTSD had their symptoms evaluated at intake and four months after discharge.10</p>
<p>They found that those who never used marijuana or quit using while in treatment had the lowest levels of PTSD symptoms, while those who continued to use or started using marijuana after treatment had worse symptoms of PTSD. Those who started using the drug during treatment had higher levels of violent behavior too.</p>
<p>Those of us working in the trenches in Colorado are seeing the downsides of what our governor has called “one of the great social experiments of the 21st century.” Emergency room physicians are seeing a significant increase in people experiencing consequences from marijuana use since it was legalized. One such physician wrote a very poignant piece about his experience returning to his home town of Pueblo, Colorado where he is now practicing.11</p>
<p>His experiences are totally supported by the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Report, volume 4 from September 2016 which documents significant increases in marijuana related emergency department visits (49%) and hospitalizations related to marijuana (32%) compared to rates prior to retail legalization. This report also documents significant increases in the use of marijuana by youth, with Colorado youth “past month marijuana use” for 2013/2014 being 74% higher than the national average, compared with 39% higher in 2011/2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Pueblo, Colorado, where I practice, it has developed into a perfect storm. According to the Healthy Kids Colorado Survey in 2015, we have the highest incidence of youth marijuana use in the state, with 30.1% reporting using marijuana in the last 30 days. The legalization of retail marijuana seems to be reflected in the increased abuse of opiates and heroin too. In addition to the highest rates of marijuana use by youth, Pueblo has the highest rates of heroin-related deaths in the state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a very disturbing correlation that needs attention. I have definitely seen in my practice that marijuana acts as a gateway drug to opiates, and to relapse to opiates after treatment if the person goes back to using marijuana. The Smart Approaches to Marijuana status report, which assesses state compliance with federal marijuana enforcement policy, following what is known as the Cole memo, documents that Colorado, four years after legalization, has failed to meet the specific DOJ requirements on controlling recreational marijuana production, distribution and use. This report documents a significant increase in drugged driving crashes, youth marijuana use, a thriving illegal black market and unabated sales of alcohol, which supports the idea that people are not using marijuana instead of alcohol but rather in addition to alcohol.</p>
<p>In spite of all this information, powerful people in the government of Colorado have publicly minimized the consequences. Larry Wolk, MD, the Chief Medical Officer for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, has reported that he has “not seen any significant problems” with the legalization of marijuana.</p>
<p>Governor Hickenlooper’s response to Attorney General Sessions recent questions about compliance with the Cole Memo minimized the adolescent use of marijuana by saying that youth marijuana use in Colorado has “remained stable since legalization.” This is not true for Pueblo, but in any event, any use of marijuana by youth in Colorado should not be minimized and should be a major concern for future generations.</p>
<p>While there are people who believe we need to enforce federal law and go back to making marijuana illegal, I am afraid the horse is already out of the barn and cannot be put back in as we already have several states with “legal” retail marijuana and multiple more with “medical marijuana.” I cannot conceive of any way this could be reversed at this point, when the majority of society supports the legalization of marijuana.</p>
<p>Solutions to our marijuana problems have to be realistic to our current situation/environment. The number one solution is more education. Many people seem to lack a true understanding of the drug and all the potential negative consequences of the higher-potency THC. This is why education is so important. Adults should have the right to make their own decisions but they need informed consent, just like with any drug.</p>
<p>The biggest concern is with adolescent use and the developing brain. This requires a lot more education and increased efforts at prevention, early intervention and treatment. I believe society would be truly served by a federal ban on all advertising of addicting drugs including alcohol, tobacco and marijuana, as well as all pharmaceutical drugs. The decision to use a pharmaceutical medication should be between the patient and the medical professional, not influenced by big industry. We clearly have the big industries— alcohol, tobacco and marijuana—doing everything they can to influence the public and convince them to use their product.</p>
<p>Since we only have anecdotal evidence at this point that marijuana can aid any medical condition, I recommend eliminating “medical marijuana” and just have retail marijuana with limits on THC and regulations similar to alcohol and tobacco. This could help take away the perception, which adolescents and others have, that because is it “medical” it must be “safe.” In order to be able to say it is medical, it should go through the same standards for testing the safety and efficacy of any prescription drug.</p>
<p>In this vein, I believe we do need more research and that marijuana should be reclassified as a schedule II drug so this can occur. Since marijuana has been used medicinally for thousands of years, I believe that the plant deserves some true research to determine if and what parts of the plant are helpful medicinally. The reports that marijuana use resulted in less than 10% becoming addicted to it were done back in the 1990s when THC levels were &lt;5%. Since we are seeing significant increases in people developing marijuana use disorder with the higher doses of THC, perhaps the limits on THC should be &lt;5%.

		<p>And Addiction-Connected Carcinogenicity, Congenital Toxicity And Heritable Genotoxicity</p>
<p>Albert Stuart Reece, Gary Kenneth Hulse</p>
<p>Extracts from the above research.  Recommend readers go to source for complete study.</p>
<p><strong>A B S T R A C T</strong></p>
<p>The recent demonstration that massive scale chromosomal shattering or pulverization can occur abruptly due to errors induced by interference with the microtubule machinery of the mitotic spindle followed by haphazard chromosomal annealing, together with sophisticated insights from epigenetics, provide profound mechanistic insights into some of the most perplexing classical observations of addiction medicine, including cancerogenesis, the younger and aggressive onset of addiction-related carcinogenesis, the heritability of addictive neurocircuitry and cancers, and foetal malformations.</p>
<p>Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other addictive agents have been shown to inhibit tubulin polymerization which perturbs the formation and function of the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. This disruption of the mitotic machinery perturbs proper chromosomal segregation during anaphase and causes micronucleus formation which is the primary locus and cause of the chromosomal pulverization of chromothripsis and downstream genotoxic events including oncogene induction and tumour suppressor silencing.</p>
<p>Moreover the complementation of multiple positive cannabis-cancer epidemiological studies, and replicated dose-response relationships with established mechanisms fulfils causal criteria. This information is also consistent with data showing acceleration of the aging process by drugs of addiction including alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, stimulants and opioids. THC shows a non-linear sigmoidal dose-response relationship in multiple pertinent in vitro and preclinical genotoxicity assays, and in this respect is similar to the serious major human mutagen thalidomide. Rising community exposure, tissue storage of cannabinoids, and increasingly potent phytocannabinoid sources, suggests that the threshold mutagenic dose for cancerogenesis will increasingly be crossed beyond the developing world, and raise transgenerational transmission of teratogenicity as an increasing concern.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above high dose cannabis and THC test positive in many genotoxicity assays, albeit often with a highly non-linear threshold like effects above low doses. As long ago as 2004 it was said that 3–41% of all neonates born in various North American communities had been exposed to cannabis [172]. Since cannabis is addictive [187], is becoming more potent [77,83,86], quickly builds up in adipose tissues [62,82] and seems generally to becoming more widely available under fluid regulatory regimes [187,188], real concern must be expressed that the rising population level of cannabinoid exposure will increasingly intersect the toxic thresholds for major genotoxicity including chromosomal clastogenicity secondary to interference and premature aging of the mitotic apparatus.</p>
<p>Under such a conceptualization, it would appear that the real boon of restrictive cannabis regimes [189] is not their supposed success in any drug war, but their confinement in the populations they protect, to a low dose exposure paradigm which limits incident and transgenerational teratogenicity, ageing, mental retardation and cancerogenicity.</p>

        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>On August 29, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued guidelines to Federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials regarding where to focus their drug enforcement efforts in states that have passed laws legalizing the retail sales of marijuana. The so-called “Cole Memo” directs enforcement officials to focus resources, including prosecutions, “on persons and organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of [eight] priorities, regardless of state law.”</p>
<p>Per the memorandum, the eight DOJ priorities are:</p>
<p>● Preventing distribution of marijuana to minors</p>
<p>● Preventing marijuana revenue from funding criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels</p>
<p>● Preventing marijuana from moving out of states where it is legal</p>
<p>● Preventing use of state-legal marijuana sales as a cover for illegal activity</p>
<p>● Preventing violence and use of firearms in growing or distributing marijuana</p>
<p>● Preventing drugged driving or exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use</p>
<p>● Preventing growing marijuana on public lands</p>
<p>● Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property</p>
<p>According to the Department of Justice, the Federal “hands-off” approach to marijuana enforcement enumerated in the Cole Memo is contingent on its expectation that “states and local governments that have enacted laws authorizing marijuana-related conduct will implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that will address the threat those state laws could pose to public safety, public health, and other law enforcement interests.</p>
<p>A system adequate to that task must not only contain robust controls and procedures on paper, it must also be effective in practice.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize the recreational sale of marijuana in 2012, evidence has emerged that regulations intended to control the sale and use of marijuana have failed to meet the promises made by advocates for legalization.</p>
<p>For example, states with legal marijuana are seeing an increase in drugged driving crashes and youth marijuana use. States that have legalized marijuana are also failing to shore up state budget shortfalls with marijuana taxes, continuing to see a thriving illegal black market, and are experiencing an unabated sales of alcohol, despite campaign promises from advocates promising that marijuana would be used as a “safer” alternative instead.</p>
<p>Moreover, state regulatory frameworks established post-legalization have failed to meet each of the specific DOJ requirements on controlling recreational marijuana production, distribution, and use.</p>
<p>While long-term studies and research on the public health and safety impacts of marijuana legalization are ongoing, this report provides a partial census of readily available information that demonstrates how Colorado, Oregon, and Washington State &#8211;</p>
<p>the jurisdictions with the most mature regulatory markets and schemes &#8211; have not fulfilled the requirements of the Cole Memo.</p>
<p>DOJ Guideline 1: “Preventing distribution of marijuana to minors”</p>
<p>● According to the nation&#8217;s largest and most comprehensive survey of drug use trends in the nation, past-month use of marijuana among 12 to 17-year-olds in Colorado increased significantly &#8211; from 9.82% to 12.56% after marijuana retail sales began (Colorado legalized marijuana in 2012 and implemented legal marijuana stores in 2014).</p>
<p>The same study notes that teens and adults in Colorado now use marijuana at a higher rate than the rest of the country. No other representative sample of drug users in Colorado has contradicted this sample.</p>
<p>● A 2017 study from the University of Colorado found that marijuana-related emergency room visits and visits to its satellite urgent care centers by teens in Colorado more than quadrupled after the state legalized marijuana.</p>
<p>● In Colorado, a new report from the state’s public safety agency reveals that after the state legalized the drug, marijuana-related arrests for black and Hispanic youth rose by 58% and 29% respectively, while arrest rates for white kids dropped by eight percent. School Resource Officers in Colorado have reported a substantial increase in marijuana-related offenses in Colorado schools after the state commercialized the drug.</p>
<p>● According to data from the State of Washington, there have been over 240 violations of legal marijuana sales to minors and of minors frequenting restricted marijuana sales areas as of July 2017. ● Youth use – among 8th and 10th graders at least – is increasing in Washington State. According to a special analysis of teenage drug use published in the peer-reviewed, highly regarded Journal of American Medical Association Pediatrics, the perceived  harmfulness of marijuana in Washington declined 14.2% and 16.1% among eighth and 10th graders, respectively, while marijuana use increased 2.0% and 4.1% from 2010-2012 to 2013-2015.</p>
<p>● According to the Washington State Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction during 2013-2014, 48 percent of statewide student expulsions were for marijuana in comparison to alcohol, tobacco, and other illicit drugs. During the 2014-2015 school year, statewide student expulsions for marijuana increased to 60 percent. Marijuana related suspensions for the 2013-2014 school year reported 42 percent and for the 2014-2015 school year, suspensions increased to 49 percent.</p>
<p>● In Washington State, youth (12-17) accounted for 64.9% of all state marijuana seizures in 2015 as compared to 29.9% in 2010, according to data from the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS).</p>
<p>● From 2012 to 2016, reported exposure calls for marijuana increased 105 percent in Washington. According to the 2016 Annual Cannabis Toxic Trends Report, of exposures related to children under the age of five, 73 percent occurred in those one to three years of age. The counties with the highest reported exposures for both 2015 and 2016 were: King, Spokane, Snohomish, and Pierce.</p>
<p>DOJ Guideline 2: “Preventing revenue of the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels”</p>
<p>● In June 2017, Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman announced a takedown of a massive illegal marijuana trafficking ring in Colorado. The bust is the largest since legalization and indicted 62 individuals and 12 businesses in Colorado. The operation stretched into other states including Kansas, Texas, Nebraska, Ohio and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>● In March 2017, a leaked report from the Oregon State Police uncovered evidence from state officials that the black market for marijuana continues to thrive in the state. The 39-page report noted that, “The illicit exportation of cannabis must be stemmed as it undermines the spirit of the law and the integrity of the legal market&#8230;it steals economic power from the market, the government, and the citizens of Oregon, and furnishes it to criminals, thereby tarnishing state compliance efforts.”</p>

<p>Washington State Poison Center – Toxic Trends Report: 2016 Annual Cannabis Report</p>
<p>● In 2016, Seattle Police spokesman Sean Whitcomb noted that “large-scale illegal grow operations… are still prevalent in Seattle, and we do come across those with a degree of frequency.” DOJ Guideline 3: “Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states”</p>
<p>● In 2014, two states &#8211; Nebraska and Oklahoma &#8211; sued their neighbor state of Colorado by citing evidence of increased marijuana flowing into those states. Law enforcement officials have reported a substantial increase in marijuana flow across state borders into neighboring states.</p>
<p>● In 2016, there were multiple raids conducted by state law enforcement in Colorado, leading authorities to seize more than 22,0000 pounds of marijuana intended for sales outside of Colorado.</p>
<p>● According to the Oregon State Police, the state has an “expansive geographic footprint” on marijuana exports across the U.S. Several counties in Oregon including Jackson, Multnomah, Josephine, Lane, Deschutes and Washington &#8220;lead the way&#8221; in supplying marijuana to states where it is not legal.</p>
<p>● According to the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area task force, “there were 360 seizures of marijuana in Colorado destined for other states. This is nearly a 600% increase in the number of individual stops in a decade, seizing about 3,671 pounds in 2014. Of the 360 seizures reported in 2014, 36 different states were identified as destinations, the most common being Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Oklahoma and Florida.”</p>
<p>● Law enforcement officials report that since legalization in 2012, Washington State marijuana has been found to be destined for 38 different states throughout the United States. Between 2012 and 2017, 8,242.39 kilograms (18,171.35 pounds) have been seized in 733 individual seizure events across 38 states. From 2012 to 2016, 470 pounds of marijuana have been seized on Washington State highways and interstates. Since 2012, 320 pounds of Washington State-origin marijuana have been seized during attempted parcel diversions. DOJ Guideline 4: “Preventing state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity”</p>
<p>● According to Jorge Duque from the Colorado Department of Law, cartels operating in Colorado are now “trading drugs like heroin for marijuana,” and the trade has since opened the door to drug and human trafficking. Duque also explains that money 5 laundering is a growing problem as “cartels are often disguising their money through legally purchasing marijuana or buying houses and growing marijuana in it.”</p>
<p>● In June 2017, a former Colorado marijuana enforcement officer and a Denver-based marijuana entrepreneur were indicted for running a statewide marijuana trafficking ring that illegally produced and sold “millions of dollars worth of marijuana across state lines.” This trafficking organization obtained 14 marijuana licenses in order to present their activities as protected business endeavors, despite “never ma[king] a single legal sale of cannabis in their two years of operation.”</p>
<p>● In Oregon, State Police officials report that criminals are exploiting Oregon’s legal marijuana industry for financial crimes and fraud. In one example, according to the Oregon State Police report, “Tisha Silver of Cannacea Medical Marijuana Dispensary falsified licensing to solicit investors and worked with Green Rush Consulting to locate unwitting investors. Silver exploited the burgeoning cannabis industry in the state to entice investors to back an illegitimate company, securing a quarter of a million dollars in fraudulent gains. According to some analysts, cannabis investors fell prey to ‘pump and dump’ schemes and lost up to $23.3 billion in 2014 alone.”</p>
<p>● Officials in Oregon note that the U.S. Postal Service is being exploited to ship marijuana products and revenue. According to former Attorney General Eric Holder, “The Postal Service is being used to facilitate drug dealing,” a clear violation of federal law and a violation of the sanctity of the U.S. mailing system.</p>
<p>DOJ Guideline 5: “Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana”</p>
<p>● While crime rates dropped or remained stable in many of the nation’s largest cities, Colorado’s crime rate increased. There has been an increase in rape, murder, robbery and auto thefts. While it is not possible to link legalization to a direct change in crime rates, officials in Colorado cited marijuana legalization as one of the reasons behind the rise.</p>
<p>● In Colorado, prosecutors are reporting an increase in marijuana-related homicides since the state legalized the drug.  This situation is detailed here: http://www.oregonlive.com/marijuana/index.ssf/2016/07/state_slaps_portland_dispensar.h tml.</p>
<p>Other instances of fraud have been discussed here: Sapient Investigations Newsletters (2015, Feb. 10) “High Times for Fraud,&#8221; available online at https://sapientinvestigations.com/spi-news/high-times-for-fraud/</p>
<p>● In Oregon, state police report that, “Cannabis is a lucrative target for robbery. As recently as December 2016, a state-licensed cannabis producer was targeted for a violent armed robbery. In the aforementioned case, a well-known cannabis grower in Jackson County was assaulted, bound, and his harvest was taken by armed assailants.”</p>
<p>● In Prince George&#8217;s County Maryland, Police Chief Henry Stawinski noted a significant rise in marijuana-related homicides since neighboring D.C. legalized the drug. Stawinski said 19 homicides in 2016 were related to marijuana.</p>
<p>DOJ Guideline 6:  “Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other public health consequences associated with marijuana use”</p>
<p>● Drugged driving has increased in states with legal marijuana sales. According to a study published by the American Automobile Association, fatal drugged driving crashes doubled in Washington State after the state legalized marijuana. The Governors Highway Safety Association also notes a disturbing rise in drugged driving crashes even as alcohol-related crashes are declining.</p>
<p>● A Denver Post analysis found the number of marijuana-impaired drivers involved in fatal crashes in Colorado more than doubled since 2013, the year after the state voted to legalize recreational marijuana use. Colorado saw a 145 percent increase in the number of marijuana-impaired drivers involved in fatal crashes between 2013 and 2016. Marijuana is also figuring into more of Colorado’s fatal crashes overall: in 2013, marijuana-impaired drivers accounted for 10 percent of all fatal crashes, but by 2016 it reached 20 percent.</p>
<p>● According to a study published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, poison control calls for children more than tripled after marijuana legalization. Much of this is linked to a boom in the sale of marijuana “edibles.” THC concentrate is mixed into almost any type of food or drink, including gummy candy, soda, and lollipops. Today, these edibles comprise at least half of Colorado’s marijuana market.</p>
<p>● In Washington State, the number of marijuana-involved DUIs are increasing with 38 percent of total cases submitted in 2016 testing above the five nanogram per milliliter of blood legal limit for those over the age of twenty-one. In addition, 10 percent of drivers involved in a fatal accident from 2010 to 2014 were THC-positive.</p>
<p>● A study by the Highway Loss Data Institute reveals that Colorado, Oregon, and Washington have experienced three percent more collision claims overall than would ( NWHIDTA Drug Threat Assessment For Program Year 2018)  have been expected without legalization.</p>
<p>Colorado witnessed the largest jump in claims. The state experienced a rate 14 percent higher than neighboring states.</p>
<p>● In Washington State, from 2012 to 2016, calls to poison control centers increased by 79.48%. Exposures increased 19.65% from the time of marijuana commercialization in 2014 to 2016. Of the marijuana calls answered by the Poison Center in 2016, youth under the age of 20 accounted for almost 40% of all calls.</p>
<p>According to the 2016 Annual Cannabis Toxic Trends Report, 42% of the calls reported were for persons aged 13 to 29. Additionally, among exposures related to children under the age of five, 73% involved children one to three years of age. The counties with the highest reported number of exposures for 2015 remained in the top four for 2016: King, Spokane, Snohomish, and Pierce.</p>
<p>DOJ Guideline 7: “Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana on public lands”</p>
<p>● In Washington State, 373,778 marijuana plants were found growing illegally on public and private lands between 2012 and 2016. Of the illegal marijuana plants eradicated in 2016, 60% were being cultivated on state land, and the 58,604 illegal marijuana plants eradicated in 2016 consumed an estimated 43.2 million gallons of water over a full growing season (120-day cycle).</p>
<p>More than 400 pounds of fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides were removed from illegal marijuana growing operations in 2016, and Furadan, a neurotoxin that is extremely dangerous to humans, was found in an illegal marijuana growing operation the same year.</p>
<p>● In June 2017, Colorado officials found more than 7,000 illegal plants on federal land in the state’s San Isabel National Forest. This was the fifth illegal grow found in that area alone since the year marijuana legalization passed, demonstrating legalization has not curbed the problem of grows exploiting public lands.</p>
<p>● In Oregon, the legalization of marijuana in the state has failed to eliminate illegal growing operations and public lands continue to be exploited despite a legal market. According to a report from state officials, “To date in Oregon, cannabis legalization has not had a noticeable influence on Mexican National [Drug Trafficking Organizations] illicit cannabis cultivation operations on public lands… leaving a lasting scar on Oregon’s unique ecosystems.</p>
<p>Illicit cannabis grows employ excessive amounts of pesticides, rodenticides, and herbicides, thereby threatening local wildlife habitats. Additionally, many illicit grow sites clear-cut timber, furthering soil erosion and water contamination. Research on the environmental impact of illicit cannabis grows indicates that grows tend to be bunched near water sources, resulting in disproportionate impacts on ecologically important areas&#8230;</p>
<p>Oregon is robbed of roughly 122 Olympic swimming pools 8 worth of water annually, or roughly 442,200 gallons of water daily during the growth season.”</p>
<p>DOJ Guideline 8: “Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property”</p>
<p>● Advocates for legal marijuana frequently flout federal laws by possessing and using marijuana on federal properties purportedly in acts of civil disobedience. In January 2017, one group gave away free marijuana in Washington, D.C. to smoke on the National Mall during the inauguration of President Trump. On April 24, 2017, four activists were arrested after purposely flouting federal law and publicly using marijuana on U.S. Capitol grounds.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion and Key Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Federal resources should target the big players in the marijuana industry. Individual marijuana users should not be targeted or arrested, but large-scale marijuana businesses, several of which now boast of having raised over $100 million in capital, and their financial backers, should be a priority. These large businesses are pocketing millions by flouting federal law, deceiving Americans about the risks of their products, and targeting the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>They should not have access to banks, where their financial prowess would be expanded significantly, nor should they be able to advertise or commercialize marijuana.</p>
<p>These businesses target many of the marijuana products they sell toward kids, such as pot candies, cookies, and ice cream. And despite state regulations, these products continue to have problems with contamination. Recently, one of the largest, most sophisticated manufacturers of these pot “edibles” was forced to recall a number of products because they contained non-food-grade ingredients.</p>
<p>Additionally, the black market continues unabated in legalized states. A leaked report from Oregon police showed that at least 70 percent of that state’s marijuana market is illegal, despite legalization. In June 2017, Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman said, “The black market for marijuana has not gone away since recreational marijuana was legalized in our state, and in fact continues to flourish.”</p>
<p>Further, state-legal businesses have acted as top cover for these illegal operations, as recent large-scale arrests in Colorado have shown. These large marijuana operations, which combine the tactics of Big Tobacco with black marketeering, should form the focus of federal law enforcement, not individual users.  Recalls are becoming more commonplace because of pesticides, moulds, and other issues.</p>
<p>See The Denver Post for news stories related to these recalls in legalized states: http://www.thecannabist.co/tag/marijuana-recall/</p>
<p>At the same time, the federal government along with non-government partners should implement a strong, evidence-based marijuana information campaign, similar to the truth ® campaign for tobacco, which alerts all Americans about the harms of marijuana and the deceitful practices of the marijuana industry.</p>

		<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>Cannabis is increasingly available for the treatment of chronic pain, yet its efficacy remains uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose: </strong></p>
<p>To review the benefits of plant-based cannabis preparations for treating chronic pain in adults and the harms of cannabis use in chronic pain and general adult populations.</p>
<p><strong>Data Sources:</strong></p>
<p>MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and several other sources from database inception to March 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection: </strong></p>
<p>Intervention trials and observational studies, published in English, involving adults using plant-based cannabis preparations that reported pain, quality of life, or adverse effect outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> Two investigators independently abstracted study characteristics and assessed study quality, and the investigator group graded the overall strength of evidence using standard criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Data Synthesis:</strong> From 27 chronic pain trials, there is low-strength evidence that cannabis alleviates neuropathic pain but insufficient evidence in other pain populations. According to 11 systematic reviews and 32 primary studies, harms in general population studies include increased risk for motor vehicle accidents, psychotic symptoms, and short-term cognitive impairment. Although adverse pulmonary effects were not seen in younger populations, evidence on most other long-term physical harms, in heavy or long-term cannabis users, or in older populations is insufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Few methodologically rigorous trials; the cannabis formulations studied may not reflect commercially available products; and limited applicability to older, chronically ill populations and patients who use cannabis heavily.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong></p>
<p>Limited evidence suggests that cannabis may alleviate neuropathic pain in some patients, but insufficient evidence exists for other types of chronic pain. Among general populations, limited evidence suggests that cannabis is associated with an increased risk for adverse mental health effects.</p>

        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p><em>Arrests are up. We still have a black market. And people are in danger.</em></p>
<p>Last week, Senator Cory Booker introduced the Marijuana Justice Act in an effort to legalize marijuana across the nation and penalize local communities that want nothing to do with this dangerous drug. This is the furthest reaching marijuana legalization effort to date and marks another sad moment in our nation’s embrace of a drug that will have generational consequences.</p>
<p>Our country is facing a drug epidemic. Legalizing recreational marijuana will do nothing that Senator Booker expects. We heard many of these same promises in 2012 when Colorado legalized recreational marijuana.</p>
<p>In the years since, Colorado has seen an increase in marijuana related traffic deaths, poison control calls, and emergency room visits. The marijuana black market has increased in Colorado, not decreased. And, numerous Colorado marijuana regulators have been indicted for corruption.</p>
<p>In 2012, we were promised funds from marijuana taxes would benefit our communities, particularly schools. Dr. Harry Bull, the Superintendent of Cherry Creek Schools, one of the largest school districts in the state, said, &#8220;So far, the only thing that the legalization of marijuana has brought to our schools has been marijuana.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2016, marijuana tax revenue resulted in $156,701,018. The total tax revenue for Colorado was $13,327,123,798, making marijuana only 1.18% of the state&#8217;s total tax revenue. The cost of marijuana legalization in public awareness campaigns, law enforcement, healthcare treatment, addiction recovery, and preventative work is an unknown cost to date.</p>
<p>Senator Booker stated his reasons for legalizing marijuana is to reduce &#8220;marijuana arrests happening so much in our country, targeting certain communities &#8211; poor communities, minority communities.&#8221; It&#8217;s a noble cause to seek to reduce incarceration rates among these communities but legalizing marijuana has had the opposite effect.</p>
<p>According to the Colorado Department of Public Safety, arrests in Colorado of black and Latino youth for marijuana possession have increased 58% and 29% respectively after legalization. This means that Black and Latino youth are being arrested more for marijuana possession after it became legal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a vast majority of Colorado&#8217;s marijuana businesses are concentrated in neighborhoods of color. Leaders from these communities, many of whom initially voted to legalize recreational marijuana, often speak out about the negative impacts of these businesses.</p>
<p>Senator Booker released his bill just a few days after the Washington Post reported on a study by the Review of Economic Studies that found &#8220;college students with access to recreational cannabis on average earn worse grades and fail classes at a higher rate.&#8221; Getting off marijuana especially helped lower performing students who were at risk of dropping out.</p>
<p>Since legalizing marijuana, Colorado&#8217;s youth marijuana use rate is the highest in the nation, 74% higher than the national average, according to the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Report. This is having terribly negative effects on the education of our youth.</p>
<p>If Senator Booker is interested in serving poor and minority communities, legalizing marijuana is one of the worst decisions. There is much work to be done to reduce incarceration and recidivism, but flooding communities with drugs will do nothing but exacerbate the problems.</p>
<p>The true impact of marijuana on our communities is just starting to be learned. The negative consequences of legalizing recreational marijuana will be felt for generations. I encourage Senator Booker to spend time with parents, educators, law enforcement, counsellors, community leaders, pastors, and legislators before rushing to legalize marijuana nationally. We’ve seen the effects in our neighborhoods in Colorado, and this is nothing we wish upon the nation.</p>

		<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Key Points</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>  Are US state medical marijuana laws one of the underlying factors for increases in risk for adult cannabis use and cannabis use disorders seen since the early 1990s?</p>
<p><strong>Findings</strong>  In this analysis using US national survey data collected in 1991-1992, 2001-2002, and 2012-2013 from 118 497 participants, the risk for cannabis use and cannabis use disorders increased at a significantly greater rate in states that passed medical marijuana laws than in states that did not.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>  Possible adverse consequences of illicit cannabis use due to more permissive state cannabis laws should receive consideration by voters, legislators, and policy and health care professionals, with appropriate health care planning as such laws change.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Abstract</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Importance</strong>  Over the last 25 years, illicit cannabis use and cannabis use disorders have increased among US adults, and 28 states have passed medical marijuana laws (MML). Little is known about MML and adult illicit cannabis use or cannabis use disorders considered over time.</p>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>  To present national data on state MML and degree of change in the prevalence of cannabis use and disorders.</p>
<p><strong>Design, Participants, and Setting </strong> Differences in the degree of change between those living in MML states and other states were examined using 3 cross-sectional US adult surveys: the National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (NLAES; 1991-1992), the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; 2001-2002), and the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions–III (NESARC-III; 2012-2013). Early-MML states passed MML between NLAES and NESARC (“earlier period”). Late-MML states passed MML between NESARC and NESARC-III (“later period”).</p>
<p><strong>Main Outcomes and Measures </strong> Past-year illicit cannabis use and DSM-IV cannabis use disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>  Overall, from 1991-1992 to 2012-2013, illicit cannabis use increased significantly more in states that passed MML than in other states (1.4–percentage point more; SE, 0.5; P = .004), as did cannabis use disorders (0.7–percentage point more; SE, 0.3; P = .03).</p>
<p>In the earlier period, illicit cannabis use and disorders decreased similarly in non-MML states and in California (where prevalence was much higher to start with). In contrast, in remaining early-MML states, the prevalence of use and disorders increased.</p>
<p>Remaining early-MML and non-MML states differed significantly for use (by 2.5 percentage points; SE, 0.9; P = .004) and disorder (1.1 percentage points; SE, 0.5; P = .02). In the later period, illicit use increased by the following percentage points: never-MML states, 3.5 (SE, 0.5); California, 5.3 (SE, 1.0); Colorado, 7.0 (SE, 1.6); other early-MML states, 2.6 (SE, 0.9); and late-MML states, 5.1 (SE, 0.8). Compared with never-MML states, increases in use were significantly greater in late-MML states (1.6–percentage point more; SE, 0.6; P = .01), California (1.8–percentage point more; SE, 0.9; P = .04), and Colorado (3.5–percentage point more; SE, 1.5; P = .03).</p>
<p>Increases in cannabis use disorder, which was less prevalent, were smaller but followed similar patterns descriptively, with change greater than never-MML states in California (1.0–percentage point more; SE, 0.5; P = .06) and Colorado (1.6–percentage point more; SE, 0.8; P = .04).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions and Relevance</strong></p>
<p>Medical marijuana laws appear to have contributed to increased prevalence of illicit cannabis use and cannabis use disorders. State-specific policy changes may also have played a role. While medical marijuana may help some, cannabis-related health consequences associated with changes in state marijuana laws should receive consideration by health care professionals and the public.</p>

		<p>LONDON (Reuters) &#8211; People who smoke marijuana have a three times greater risk of dying from hypertension, or high blood pressure, than those who have never used the drug, scientists said on Wednesday. The risk grows with every year of use, they said.</p>
<p>The findings, from a study of some 1,200 people, could have implications in the United States among other countries. Several states have legalized marijuana and others are moving toward it. It is decriminalized in a number of other countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Support for liberal marijuana use is partly due to claims that it is beneficial and possibly not harmful to health,&#8221; said Barbara Yankey, who co-led the research at the school of public health at Georgia State University in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important to establish whether any health benefits outweigh the potential health, social and economic risks. If marijuana use is implicated in cardiovascular diseases and deaths, then it rests on the health community and policy makers to protect the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marijuana is also sometimes used for medicinal purposes, such as for glaucoma.</p>
<p>The study, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, was a retrospective follow-up study of 1,213 people aged 20 or above who had been involved in a large and ongoing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In 2005–2006, they were asked if they had ever used marijuana.</p>
<p>For Yankey&#8217;s study, information on marijuana use was merged with mortality data in 2011 from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, and adjusted for confounding factors such as tobacco smoking and variables including sex, age and ethnicity.</p>
<p>The average duration of use among users of marijuana, or cannabis, was 11.5 years.</p>
<p>The results showed marijuana users had a 3.42-times higher risk of death from hypertension than non-users, and a 1.04 greater risk for each year of use.</p>
<p>There was no link between marijuana use and dying from heart or cerebrovascular diseases such as strokes.</p>
<p>Yankey said were limitations in the way marijuana use was assessed &#8212; including that researchers could not be sure whether people had used the drug continuously since they first tried it.</p>
<p>But she said the results chimed with plausible risks, since marijuana is known to affect the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marijuana stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increases in heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen demand,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Experts not directly involved in the study said its findings would need to be replicated, but already raised concerns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the widely held view that cannabis is benign, this research adds to previous work suggesting otherwise,&#8221; said Ian Hamilton, a lecturer in mental health at Britain&#8217;s York University.

		<p>A string of recent deaths in New Zealand is being attributed to the rise of so-called synthetic cannabis is made to look like normal cannabis</p>
<p>A man in his 20s died on Tuesday night, bringing the number of fatalities this month linked to the illegal substance to eight.  The drug consists of dried plants sprayed with synthetic drugs &#8211; it triggers effects similar to cannabis but is more powerful and dangerous.  Synthetic cannabis has already caused huge concerns in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>In each of the eight deaths this month, the victim was thought to have used the drug before dying or was found with the drug on them.  The actual substance in the drug responsible for the deaths is not yet known.</p>
<p>All eight deaths have occurred in Auckland and authorities say there is a much higher number of non-fatal cases where people had to be taken to hospital.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Auckland City District Police issued a warning on Facebook over the drug use and the apparent link to the rising number of victims.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not an issue unique to Auckland,&#8221; the statement warned. &#8220;Police are also concerned at the impact of synthetic cannabis in other communities in New Zealand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Auckland police also took the rare step of releasing CCTV footage of a man violently ill and barely able to stand after smoking synthetic cannabis.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have grave concerns as users don&#8217;t know what poisonous chemicals they are potentially putting into their bodies when they&#8217;re smoking this drug,&#8221; Det Insp Lendrum said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is synthetic cannabis?</strong></p>
<p>§ Actual cannabis contains an active ingredient which interacts with certain receptors in the brain.</p>
<p>§ Synthetic cannabis is dried plant matter sprayed with chemicals that interact with the same receptors.</p>
<p>§ Produced and sold illegally, the chemicals used vary a lot. That means the effect of the drug is a lot less predictable, so a lot more dangerous.</p>
<p>§ Effects can be extreme, including increased heart rates, seizures, psychosis, kidney failure and strokes.</p>
<p>Cannabis-simulating substances &#8211; or synthetic cannabinoids &#8211; were developed more than 20 years ago in the US for testing on animals as part of a brain research programme.  But in the last decade or so they&#8217;ve become widely available to the public.</p>
<p>In the UK, synthetic cannabis was also temporarily legal, being sold under a variety of names most prominently Spice and Black Mamba.  The drugs were banned in 2016 but continue to cause widespread problems in the country.</p>
<p>Synthetic cannabis has also been banned in the US but continues to be widely available as an illegal drug.</p>

		<p>Legalizing marijuana not only harms public health and safety, it places a significant strain on local economies and weakens the ability of the American workforce to compete in an increasingly global marketplace.</p>
<p>Today, a growing class of well-heeled lobbyists intent on commercializing marijuana are doing everything they can to sell legal weed as a panacea for every contemporary challenge we face in America. Over the past several years we&#8217;ve been barraged by claims that legal pot can cure the opioid crisis, cure cancer, eliminate international drug cartels, and even solve climate change.</p>
<p>One seemingly compelling case made by special interest groups is that legal marijuana can boost our economy too: after all, marijuana businesses create jobs and bring in millions of dollars in much-needed tax revenue.</p>
<p>Yet, a closer look at the facts reveals a starkly different reality. The truth is, a commercial market for marijuana not only harms public health and safety, it also places a significant strain on local economies and weakens the ability of the American workforce to compete in an increasingly global marketplace.</p>
<p>We already know that drug use costs our economy hundreds of millions of dollars a year in public health and safety costs. The last comprehensive study to look at costs of drugs in society found that drug use cost taxpayers more than $193 billion – due to lost work productivity, health care costs, and higher crime. A new study out of Canada found that marijuana-impaired driving alone costs more than $1 billion. Laws commercializing marijuana only make this problem worse and hamper local communities&#8217; ability to deal with the health and safety fallout of increased drug use.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far in Colorado, marijuana taxes have failed to shore up state budget shortfalls. The budget deficit there doubled in the last few years, despite claims that pot taxes could turn deficit into surplus.&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just a theory &#8211; it&#8217;s already happening. As marijuana use has increased in states that have legalized it, so has use by employees, both on and off the job. Large businesses in Colorado now state that after legalization they have had to hire out-of-state residents in order to find employees that can pass a pre-employment drug screen, particularly for safety-sensitive jobs like bus drivers, train operators, and pilots.</p>
<p>And now drug using employees &#8211; supported by special interest groups &#8211; are organizing to make drug use a &#8220;right&#8221; despite the negative impacts we know it will have on employers and the companies that hire them.</p>
<p>And what about that promised tax revenue? So far in Colorado, marijuana taxes have failed to shore up state budget shortfalls. The budget deficit there doubled in the last few years, despite claims that pot taxes could turn deficit into surplus.</p>
<p>Collected pot taxes only comprise a tiny fraction of the Colorado state budget— less than one percent. After costs of enforcement and regulation are subtracted, the remaining revenue used for public good is very limited.</p>
<p>Even viewed solely in the context of Colorado&#8217;s educational needs, pot revenue is not newsworthy. The Colorado Department of Education indicates their schools require about $18 billion in capital construction funds alone. Marijuana taxes do not even make a dent in this gap.</p>
<p>In Washington State, half of the $42 million of marijuana tax money legalization advocates promised would reach prevention programs and schools by 2016 never materialized. We&#8217;ve seen this movie before: witness our experience with gambling, the lottery, and other vices.</p>
<p>We should also care about the human fallout of increased marijuana acceptance. Recent evidence demonstrates that today&#8217;s marijuana isn&#8217;t the weed of the 1960s. It is addictive and harmful to the human brain, especially when used by adolescents.</p>
<p>Moreover, in states that have already legalized the drug, there has been an increase in drugged driving crashes and youth marijuana use. States that have legalized marijuana also continue to see a thriving black market, and are experiencing a continued rise in alcohol sales despite arguing users will switch to a &#8220;safer&#8221; drug.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, the Trump Administration has signaled it is considering a crackdown on marijuana in states where it is legal. We don&#8217;t yet know what this policy change may look like, but one thing we know for sure is that incarcerating low-level, nonviolent offenders in federal prisons is not the answer. Individual users need incentives to encourage them to make healthy decisions, not handcuffs.</p>
<p>But we do need to enforce federal law. Indeed, by reasserting federal control over the exploding marijuana industry, we know we can make a positive difference in preventing the commercialization of a drug that will put profits over public health and fight every regulation proposed to control its sale and use. Marijuana addiction is real, and simply ignoring this health condition will only cost us down the road. We should assess marijuana users for drug use disorders as well as mental health problems, and assist those into recovery. This can&#8217;t happen in a climate that promotes use.</p>

		<p>A new study provides credible evidence that marijuana legalization will lead to decreased academic success. (Elaine Thompson/AP)</p>
<p>The most rigorous study yet of the effects of marijuana legalization has identified a disturbing result: College students with access to recreational cannabis on average earn worse grades and fail classes at a higher rate. Economists Olivier Marie and Ulf Zölitz took advantage of a decision by Maastricht, a city in the Netherlands, to change the rules for “cannabis cafes,” which legally sell recreational marijuana. Because Maastricht is very close to the border of multiple European countries (Belgium, France and Germany), drug tourism was posing difficulties for the city. Hoping to address this, the city barred noncitizens of the Netherlands from buying from the cafes.</p>
<p>This policy change created an intriguing natural experiment at Maastricht University, because students there from neighboring countries suddenly were unable to access legal pot, while students from the Netherlands continued.</p>
<p>The research on more than 4,000 students, published in the Review of Economic Studies, found that those who lost access to legal marijuana showed substantial improvement in their grades. Specifically, those banned from cannabis cafes had a more than 5 percent increase in their odds of passing their courses. Low performing students benefited even more, which the researchers noted is particularly important because these students are at high-risk of dropping out. The researchers attribute their results to the students who were denied legal access to marijuana being less likely to use it and to suffer cognitive impairments (e.g., in concentration and memory) as a result.</p>
<p>Other studies have tried to estimate the impact of marijuana legalization by studying those U.S. states that legalized medicinal or recreational marijuana. But marijuana policy researcher Rosalie Pacula of RAND Corporation noted that the Maastricht study provide evidence that “is much better than anything done so far in the United States.”</p>
<p>States differ in countless ways that are hard for researchers to adjust for in their data analysis, but the Maastricht study examined similar people in the same location — some of them even side by side in the same classrooms — making it easier to isolate the effect of marijuana legalization. Also, Pacula pointed out that since voters in U.S. states are the ones who approve marijuana legalization, it creates a chicken and egg problem for researchers (i.e. does legalization make people smoke more pot, or do pot smokers tend to vote for legalization?). This methodological problem was resolved in the Maastricht study because the marijuana policy change was imposed without input from those whom it affected.</p>
<p>Although this is the strongest study to date on how people are affected by marijuana legalization, no research can ultimately tell us whether legalization is a good or bad decision: That’s a political question and not a scientific one. But what the Maastricht study can do is provides highly credible evidence that marijuana legalization will lead to decreased academic success — perhaps particularly so for struggling students — and that is a concern that both proponents and opponents of legalization should keep in mind.</p>

		<p><strong>Werewolf in London? Or maybe it’s a Skunk.</strong></p>
<p>Cannabis is now the most popular illicit drug in the world. Several US states have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use and more are in the process of doing the same. Numerous prospective epidemiological studies have reported that use of cannabis is a modifiable risk factor for schizophrenia-like psychosis. In 2012, the Schizophrenia Commission in the UK concluded that research to quantify the link between cannabis use and serious mental illness should be pursued.</p>
<p>Between May 1, 2005, and May 31, 2011, researchers culled data from 410 patients with first-episode psychosis and 370 controls. The risk of individuals having a psychotic disorder was approximately three-fold higher among users of “skunk-like” cannabis, compared with those who never used cannabis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2•92, 95% CI 1•52–3•45, p=0•001). Further, daily use of skunk-like cannabis resulted in the highest risk of psychotic disorders, compared with no use of cannabis (adjusted OR 5•4, 95% CI 2•81–11•31, p=0•002).</p>
<p>The population attributable fraction of first episode psychosis for skunk use for the geographical area of south London was 24% (95% CI 17–31), possibly because of the high prevalence of high-potency cannabis (218 [53%] of 410 patients) in the study.</p>
<p>Clearly, and as seen elsewhere, availability of high potency cannabis in south London most likely resulted in a greater proportion of first onset psychosis than in previous studies where the cannabis is less potent.</p>
<p><strong>Why Does this Matter?</strong></p>
<p>Changes in marijuana potency and the increased prevalence of use by adolescents and young adults increases the risk of serious mental illness and the burden on the mental health system.</p>
<p>Chronic, relapsing psychotic illness produced by cannabis is similar to that produced naturally in Schizophrenia. However, treatment responses are not the same. Indeed, skunk use appears to contribute to 24% of cases of first episode psychosis in south London. Our findings show the importance of raising awareness among young people of the risks associated with the use of high-potency cannabis. The need for such public education is emphasized by the worldwide trend of liberalization of the constraints on cannabis and the fact that high potency varieties are becoming increasingly available.</p>
<p>Finally, in both primary care and mental health services, developing a simple screening instrument as simple as yes-or-no questions of whether people use skunk or other drugs will aid public health officials to identify epidemiological maps and “hot spots” of increased drug use and to develop interdiction, education and prevention efforts.</p>

		<p>Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in the United States, and trends show increasing use in the general population. As cannabis consumption rises, there has been significant emerging evidence for cannabis-related risks to health.1</p>
<p>Numerous lines of evidence suggest a correlation between cannabis consumption and a variety of psychiatric conditions, including cannabis-induced psychosis (CIP). While it can be difficult to differentiate CIP from other psychoses, CIP holds distinguishing characteristics, which may aid in its diagnosis. Given the increasing push toward cannabis legalization, assessing CIP and employing timely treatments is critical.</p>
<p>Specifically in youth, there is a direct relationship between cannabis use and its risks. The lack of knowledge surrounding its detrimental effects, combined with misunderstandings related to its therapeutic effects, has potential for catastrophic results.</p>
<p>CASE VIGNETTE</p>
<p>Ms. J, a 19-year-old college sophomore, was admitted to the Early Psychosis Unit at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) displaying signs of agitation and acute psychosis. Her roommates had noted that her behavior had become increasingly bizarre, and she had isolated herself over the past month. She began smoking marijuana at the age of 17 and since starting college used it daily.</p>
<p>Ms. J exhibited signs of paranoia, believing other students in her dorm were stealing from her and trying to poison her. She remained adamant that all her problems were rooted in the competitive environment of the university and that smoking marijuana aided in keeping her sanity. In a sense, she was self-medicating. Her clinical presentation was consistent with a diagnosis of CIP.</p>
<p>After the hospitalization, she received outpatient case management services in the Early Psychosis Program at CAMH, which included motivational interviewing to raise her awareness about the importance of abstaining from cannabis use. She has been abstinent from cannabis for more than a year with no evidence of psychosis; she recently returned to school to finish her degree.</p>
<p><strong>Epidemiology of CIP</strong></p>
<p>Reports have shown a staggering increase in cannabis-related emergency department (ED) visits in recent years. In 2011, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) estimated a total of 1.25 million illicit-drug–related ED visits across the US, of which 455,668 were marijuana related.2 A similar report published in 2015 by the Washington Poison Center Toxic Trends Report showed a dramatic increase in cannabis-related ED visits.3 In states with recent legalization of recreational cannabis, similar trends were seen.4</p>
<p>States with medicinal marijuana have also shown a dramatic rise in cannabis-related ED visits. Moreover, states where marijuana is still illegal also showed increases.5 This widespread increase is postulated to be in part due to the easy accessibility of the drug, which contributes to over-intoxication and subsequent symptoms. Overall, from 2005 to 2011, there has been a dramatic rise in cannabis-related ED visits among all age groups and genders.</p>
<p><strong>Neurobiology of CIP</strong></p>
<p>Cannabis is considered an environmental risk factor that increases the odds of psychotic episodes, and longer exposure is associated with greater risk of psychosis in a dose-</p>
<p>dependent fashion. The drug acts as a stressor that leads to the emergence and persistence of psychosis. While a number of factors play a role in the mechanism by which consumption produces psychosis, the primary psychoactive ingredient is considered to be delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC). Properties of delta9-THC include a long half-life (up to 30 days to eliminate the long-acting THC metabolite carboxy-THC from urine) and high lipophilicity, which may contribute to CIP.</p>
<p>During acute consumption, cannabis causes an increase in the synthesis and release of dopamine as well as increased reuptake inhibition, similar to the process that occurs during stimulant use. Consequently, patients with CIP are found to have elevated peripheral dopamine metabolite products.</p>
<p>Findings from a study that examined presynaptic dopaminergic function in patients who have experienced CIP indicate that dopamine synthesis in the striatum has an inverse relationship with cannabis use. Long-term users had reduced dopamine synthesis, although no association was seen between dopaminergic function and CIP.6 This observation may provide insight into a future treatment hypothesis for CIP because it implies a different mechanism of psychosis compared with schizophrenia. As cannabis may not induce the same dopaminergic alterations seen in schizophrenia, CIP may require alternative approaches—most notably addressing associated cannabis use disorder.</p>
<p>Polymorphisms at several genes linked to dopamine metabolism may moderate the effects of CIP. The catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT Val 158Met) genotype has been linked to increased hallucinations in cannabis users.7Homozygous and heterozygous genetic compositions (Met/Met, Val/Met, Val/Val) for COMT Val 158Met have been studied in patients with CIP and suggest that the presence of Val/Val and Val/Met genotypes produces a substantial increase in psychosis in relation to cannabis use. This suggests that carriers of the Val allele are most vulnerable to CIP attacks.</p>
<p>There has been much controversy surrounding the validity of a CIP diagnosis and whether it is a distinct clinical entity or an early manifestation of schizophrenia. In patients being treated for schizophrenia, those with a history of CIP had an earlier onset of schizophrenia than patients who never used cannabis.8Evidence suggests an association between patients who have received treatment for CIP and later development of schizophrenia spectrum disorder. However, it has been difficult to distinguish whether CIP is an early manifestation of schizophrenia or a catalyst. Nonetheless, there is a clear association between the 2 disorders.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of CIP</strong></p>
<p>DSM-5 categorizes cannabis-induced psychotic disorder as a substance-induced psychotic disorder. However, there are distinguishing characteristics of CIP that differentiate it from other psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Clear features of CIP are sudden onset of mood lability and paranoid symptoms, within 1 week of use but as early as 24 hours after use. CIP is commonly precipitated by a sudden increase in potency (eg, percent of THC content or quantity of cannabis consumption; typically, heavy users of cannabis consume more than 2 g/d). Criteria for CIP must exclude primary psychosis, and symptoms should be in excess of expected intoxication and withdrawal effects. A comparison of the clinical features of idiopathic psychosis versus CIP is provided in the Table.</p>
<p>When assessing for CIP, careful history taking is critical. Time of last drug ingestion will indicate if a patient’s psychotic symptoms are closely related to cannabis intoxication/withdrawal effects. While acute cannabis intoxication presents with a range of transient positive symptoms (paranoia, grandiosity, perceptual alterations), mood symptoms (anxiety), and cognitive deficits (working memory, verbal recall, attention), symptoms that persist beyond the effects of intoxication and withdrawal are better categorized as CIP, regardless of the route of administration (smoke inhalation, oral, intravenous). CIP has historically been associated with fewer negative symptoms than schizophrenia; however, without a clear timeline of use, distinguishing schizophrenia from CIP may prove difficult.</p>
<p>A diagnosis of primary psychosis (eg, schizophrenia) is warranted in the absence of heavy cannabis use or withdrawal (for at least 4 weeks), or if symptoms preceded onset of heavy use. The age at which psychotic symptoms emerge has not proved to be a helpful indicator; different studies show a conflicting median age of onset.</p>
<p>Clinical features of schizophrenia and CIP share many overlapping characteristics. However, compared with primary psychoses with concurrent cannabis abuse, CIP has been established to show more mood symptoms than primary psychosis. The mood symptom profile includes obsessive ideation, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and anxiety. Of significance is the presence of social phobia: 20% of patients with CIP demonstrate phobic anxiety compared with only 3.8% of patients with primary psychosis with cannabis abuse.</p>
<p>Hypomania and agitation have also been found to be more pronounced in cases of CIP.9 Visual hallucinations are more common and more distinct in CIP than in other psychoses such as schizophrenia. Perhaps the most discriminating characteristic of CIP is awareness of the clinical condition, greater disease insight, and the ability to identify symptoms as a manifestation of a mental disorder or substance use. The presence of much more rapidly declining positive symptoms is another distinctive factor of CIP.</p>
<p>Finally, family history may help distinguish CIP from primary psychosis. Primary psychosis has a strong association with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in first- or second-degree relatives, whereas CIP has a weaker family association with psychosis.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of CIP</strong></p>
<p>As with all substance-induced psychotic states, abstinence from cannabis may be the definitive measure to prevent recurrence. With limited research surrounding CIP, achieving symptomatic treatment during acute phases of CIP has proved to be difficult. The Figure suggests possible treatment progression for CIP.</p>
<p>Pharmacotherapeutic interventions include the second-generation antipsychotic drug olanzapine and haloperidol. While both are equally effective, their different adverse- effect profiles should be taken into consideration when treating a patient; olanzapine is associated with significantly fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects.</p>
<p>One report indicates that antipsychotics worsened the condition in some patients.10 Conventional antipsychotics failed to abate the symptoms of CIP in one 20-year old man. Trials of olanzapine, lithium, and haloperidol had little to no effect on his psychosis. Risperidone was tried but elicited temporal lobe epilepsy with auditory, somatic, and olfactory hallucinations. However, the use of valproate sodium markedly improved his symptoms and cognition, returning him to baseline.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine has also been shown to have rapid effects when used as an adjunct to antipsychotics.11 Use of anti-seizure medication in CIP treatment has been hypothesized to reduce neuroleptic adverse effects, resulting in better tolerance of antipsychotics.10,11 These results suggest the use of adjunctive anti-epileptics should be considered in CIP treatment strategies, although further studies in a broad range of patients with CIP are needed.</p>
<p>Abstaining from cannabis is the most beneficial and effective measure for preventing future CIP events; however, it is likely to be the most difficult to implement.</p>
<p>Psychosocial intervention has a significant impact on early-phase psychosis, and when the intervention is initiated plays a role in disease outcomes. A delay in providing intensive psychosocial treatment has been associated with more negative symptoms compared with a delay in administrating antipsychotic medication.12 Employing cannabis- focused interventions with dependent patients who present with first-episode psychosis can decrease use in a clinically meaningful way and subjectively improve patient quality of life.</p>
<p>Compared with the standard of care, motivational interviewing significantly increases number of days abstinent from cannabis and aids in decreasing short-term consumption.13 Patients who are treated with motivational interviewing in addition to standard of care (combination of antipsychotic medication, regular office-based psychiatric contact, psychoeducation) are reported to also have more confidence and willingness to reduce cannabis use.</p>
<p>Patients with CIP who are unwilling or unable to decrease cannabis consumption may be protected from psychotic relapse with aripiprazole (10 mg/d). Its use suppresses the re-emergence of psychosis without altering cannabis levels. However, no direct comparison has been made with aripiprazole and other antipsychotics in treating CIP. Clearly, well-controlled large studies of putative treatments for CIP are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>As more countries and states approve legalization, and marijuana becomes more accessible, CIP and other cannabis-related disorders are expected to increase. Efforts should be made by physicians to educate patients and discourage cannabis use. Just as there was an era of ignorance concerning the damaging effects of tobacco, today’s conceptions about cannabis may in fact be judged similarly in the future. The onus is on psychiatrists to take an evidence-based approach to this increasing problem.</p>

		<p>As the U.S. is facing its most challenging drug epidemic in history, the need to prevent adolescence drug misuse is imperative. For the past two years, Mentor Foundation USA and George Washington University have piloted an innovative drug prevention peer-to-peer initiative at three high schools in Columbia County, NY. The program, which engages youth through social media is showing some promising results in terms of shifts in attitudes towards drugs and intent to use.</p>
<p>The interactive &#8220;multi-media&#8221; initiative is called Living the Example (LTE), a program that incorporates messages for prevention specifically designed to counteract the misinformation adolescents have about drugs and alcohol.  Messages are framed to promote the benefits of prevention behaviors. &#8220;This approach to branding, an alternative, healthy behavior, or &#8216;counter-marketing&#8217; as it has been termed in tobacco control, has been highly effective and is recognized as one of the main elements in successful prevention programs, such as in tobacco control,&#8221; says Principal Investigator, Dr. Doug Evans, a pioneer in the use of this strategy. Dr. Evans is a Professor of Prevention and Community Health &amp; Global Health, with Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.</p>
<p>Youth Ambassadors are trained to create LTE branded prevention messages, disseminate them via social media platforms, and engage peers in their preferred social networks, with the intention of increasing peer interaction around the brand&#8217;s core messaging.  Positive receptivity to LTE messages was associated with some evidence of reduced self-reported drug use intentions, specifically for marijuana use, and reports of intent to use any drug. Among youth who reported exposure and receptivity to LTE, they reported a significant decrease in marijuana use intentions. The most common overall reason for drug use among all respondents was family stress (81.3%), boredom (40%) and academic stress (40%).</p>
<p>&#8220;Findings from the study suggest that peer-to-peer substance use prevention via social media is a promising strategy, especially given the low cost and low burden as an intervention channel, which schools, communities, and prevention programs can use as an approach, even in low resource settings,&#8221; says Michaela Pratt, President of Mentor Foundation USA. &#8220;Through our international network, Mentor Foundation shares over 20 years of global experience in best prevention practices, and Mentor Foundation USA has always been a pioneer in empowering young people to become their own advocates for drug prevention.&#8221;</p>
<p>This program was generously supported by The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, Rip Van Winkle Foundation, among local foundations in Columbia County. Mentor Foundation USA is a member affiliate of Mentor International, which was founded in 1994 by Her Majesty Queen Silvia of Sweden and the World Health Organization and is the largest network of its kind for evidence based programs that prevent drug abuse among youth. Collectively, Mentor has implemented projects in over 80 countries impacting more than 6 million youth.  Mentor Foundation USA is a Delaware registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Going from an occasional user of marijuana to a weekly or daily user increases an adolescent&#8217;s risk of having recurrent psychotic-like experiences by 159%, according to a new Canadian study published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The study also reports effects of marijuana use on cognitive development and shows that the link between marijuana use and psychotic-like experiences is best explained by emerging symptoms of depression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;To clearly understand the impact of these results, it is essential to first define what psychotic-like experiences are: namely, experiences of perceptual aberration, ideas with unusual content and feelings of persecution,&#8221; said the study&#8217;s lead author, Josiane Bourque, a doctoral student at Université de Montréal&#8217;s Department of Psychiatry. &#8220;Although they may be infrequent and thus not problematic for the adolescent, when these experiences are reported continuously, year after year, then there&#8217;s an increased risk of a first psychotic episode or another psychiatric condition.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">She added: &#8220;Our findings confirm that becoming a more regular marijuana user during adolescence is, indeed, associated with a risk of psychotic symptoms. This is a major public-health concern for Canada.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>What are the underlying mechanisms?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">One of the study&#8217;s objectives was to better understand the mechanisms by which marijuana use is associated with psychotic-like experiences. Bourque and her supervisor, Dr. Patricia Conrod at Sainte Justine University Hospital Research Centre hypothesized that impairments in cognitive development due to marijuana misuse might in turn exacerbate psychotic-like experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">This hypothesis was only partially confirmed, however. Among the different cognitive abilities evaluated, the development of inhibitory control was the only cognitive function negatively affected by an increase in marijuana use. Inhibitory control is the capacity to withhold or inhibit automatic behaviours in favor of a more contextually appropriate behaviour. Dr. Conrod&#8217;s team has shown that this specific cognitive function is associated with risk for other forms of substance abuse and addiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">&#8220;Our results show that while marijuana use is associated with a number of cognitive and mental health symptoms, only an increase in symptoms of depression &#8212; such as negative thoughts and low mood &#8212; could explain the relationship between marijuana use and increasing psychotic-like experiences in youth,&#8221; Bourque said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>What&#8217;s next</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">These findings have important clinical implications for prevention programs in youth who report having persistent psychotic-like experiences. &#8220;While preventing adolescent marijuana use should be the aim of all drug strategies, targeted prevention approaches are particularly needed to delay and prevent marijuana use in young people at risk of psychosis,&#8221; said Patricia Conrod, the study&#8217;s senior author and a professor at UdeM&#8217;s Department of Psychiatry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Conrod is optimistic about one thing, however: the school-based prevention program that she developed, Preventure, has proven effective in reducing adolescent marijuana use by an overall 33%. &#8220;In future programs, it will be important to investigate whether this program and other similar targeted prevention programs can delay or prevent marijuana use in youth who suffer from psychotic-like experiences,&#8221; she said. &#8220;While the approach seems promising, we have yet to demonstrate that drug prevention can prevent some cases of psychosis.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>A large youth cohort from Montreal</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The study&#8217;s results are based on the CIHR-funded Co-Venture project, a cohort of approximately 4,000 adolescents aged 13 years old from 31 high schools in the Greater Montreal area. These teens are followed annually from Grade 7 to Grade 11. Every year they fill out computerized questionnaires to assess substance use and psychiatric symptoms. The teens also complete cognitive tasks to allow the researchers to evaluate their IQ, working memory and long-term memory as well as their inhibitory control skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">To do their study, the research team first confirmed results from both the United Kingdom and Netherlands showing the presence of a small group of individuals (in Montreal, 8%) among the general population of adolescents who report recurrent psychotic-like experiences. Second, the researchers explored how marijuana use between 13 and 16 years of age increases the likelihood of belonging to the 8%. Finally, they examined whether the relationship between increasing use of marijuana and increasing psychotic-like experiences can be explained by emerging symptoms of anxiety or depression, or by the effects of substance use on developing cognitive abilities.</span></p>

        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>Canada’s Liberal government has stated that marijuana will be decriminalized by July 2018. This means the removal, or at the least, a lessening of laws and restrictions related to marijuana use and associated pot services.</p>
<p>While people on both sides of the debate have strongly held and differing opinions, the protection of youth is an area of agreement.</p>
<p>Marijuana, also known as cannabis, has been illegal in Canada for close to 100 years. Marijuana can’t be produced, sold or even possessed. If caught, one faces fines, jail time or both.</p>
<p>Despite this, Canada has one of the highest rates of cannabis use in the world. Over 40 per cent of Canadians have used cannabis during their lifetime. Furthermore, studies conducted by Health Canada indicate that between 10.2 and 12.2 per cent of Canadians use cannabis at least once a year.</p>
<p>As changes in cannabis regulation occur, new research has been conducted. The findings are, in a word, alarming. According to published research, someone who uses marijuana regularly has, on average, less grey matter in the orbital frontal cortex of the brain. Other research has found increasing evidence of a link between pot and schizophrenia symptoms.</p>
<p>A major factor is the potency of cannabis, which has gone through the roof for the last two decades. In the 1960s, THC levels were reported to have been in the one-to-four-per-cent range. Research reported in the science journal, Live Science, in 21014 indicates that marijuana’s main psychoactive ingredient, THC, in random marijuana samples, rose from about four per cent in 1995 to about 12 per cent in 2014. In a more-recent article, the leader of the American Chemical Society stated: “We’ve seen potency values close to 30-per-cent THC, which is huge.”</p>
<p>Despite these clear and increasing dangers, the Government of Canada’s stated objective is to “legalize, strictly regulate and restrict access to cannabis for non-medical purposes.” Unfortunately, the government’s approach has serious flaws.  Most importantly, their approach lacks protections for youth, despite this being another specifically stated objective of the Canadian government’s new law.</p>
<p>While supporters of cannabis often compare it with alcohol, a legal, but carefully controlled substance in Canada, there is an important difference. Cannabis is commonly consumed by smoking, which leads to significant, second-hand affects and, as a result, second-hand structural changes in the brain.</p>
<p>In my neighbourhood, cannabis-users in one house, taking advantage of the decreasing legal response to cannabis in B.C. these days, happily smoke the substance on their back deck, only to have the blue smoke waft across to the trampoline next door, where my younger brother and his friends often play.</p>
<p>The government’s proposed new policy actually encourages youth exposure by making it legal for citizens to grow cannabis in their homes. There is no mention of the protection of children living in those residences, where cannabis is grown, consumed and potentially sold.</p>
<p>The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police makes this point well. They warn that allowing home-grown cultivation will fuel the cannabis black market and that the four-plant limit proposed under the legislation is impossible to enforce. The chiefs further note that home cultivation is a direct contradiction to the government’s promise to create a highly regulated environment that minimizes youth access to the drug.</p>
<p>The biggest concern that the youth of Canada should have about the government’s approach to decriminalization is, however, drug quality — potentially with deadly results. The opportunity for tampering is obvious. A high school friend and classmate of mine casually uses cannabis and landed in the hospital for a few weeks. She believes that some of the cannabis she used was laced with another substance. I often wonder how close my friend came to dying like another of our fellow students at New Westminster Secondary School.</p>
<p>Canada isn’t ready for the decriminalization of cannabis. The Canadian government, and our health-care and legal systems, aren’t fully prepared for the problems and long-term effects that’ll have serious consequences for our youth. Important issues, including second-hand effects and basic safety, not to mention enforcement and legal implications, have yet to be fully defined and planned for. The federal government’s plan to decriminalize pot, as it stands now, doesn’t provide enough protection for Canada’s young people.</p>

		<p><strong>Today’s Reality</strong></p>
<p>Even if you smoked pot 20+ years ago without harm, today’s situation is different.  We want our children to avoid marijuana because they care about the risks in marijuana itself.</p>
<p>Here’s the facts for raising your children today:</p>
<p>* Marijuana has been modified since 1994. The THC, which gives the high, is 3-10x stronger in the plants of today.  If a child begins using today’s pot , it’s like to learning to drink with grain alcohol, instead of beer or wine.  Also, youth today frequently use the potent “dabs” “wax” and “budder.”  These are extractions can have 40-80% THC.</p>
<p>* Marijuana is addictive, contrary to a popular myth, particularly with today’s stronger strains of pot.</p>
<p>* In states with medical marijuana, teen usage is much higher than in other states, and many teens who use pot get it from some marijuana cardholders.</p>
<p>* Those who begin in adolescence or their teens, have an addiction rate of 17 percent, as opposed to 9 percent for those who begin using marijuana as an adult. *Emergency Department hospitalizations from marijuana rose from 281,000 to 455,000 between 2004 and 2011, making it 2nd amongst the illegal drugs causing ER treatment.</p>
<p>* Individuals responses to marijuana can be vary greatly, and the potential for paranoia and psychotic reactions are real side effects, omitted in the pot propaganda.</p>
<p>* Marijuana is fat soluble and stays in the body for weeks, which is why some people have flashbacks.</p>
<p>* The  brain, which is 1/3 fat, isn’t fully developed until age 25 or later, and until it is, marijuana can cause irreversible damage.</p>
<p>* Marijuana is not as widely used as alcohol,  6-7% of the adult population, vs.  66% who drink, one reason the comparison doesn’t work. * Marijuana usage causes traffic deaths and it is not safe to combine with driving.</p>
<p>* More teens seek substance abuse treatment for pot than any other legal or illegal substance. * Marijuana is a gateway drug,  because nearly every young person who develops a drug addiction begins with marijuana.  Early pot users such as Robert Downey, Jr. (age 9), and Cameron Douglas  (age 13), prove that the stranglehold of drug addiction lasts for years.</p>
<p>* A multi-year study out of New Zealand, tracking marijuana users and through their mid-30s showed IQs decrease an 6-8 percentage points over time.  Again, we point to the medical studies summarized on this webpage.</p>
<p>* In a recent study, schizophrenics who have used marijuana had an onset of the disease 2-1/2 years earlier than those who did not use marijuana. * Marijuana can trigger psychotic symptoms and/or mental illness, and cognitive decline in youth, more quickly than alcohol, while tobacco does not.</p>
<p>* Since marijuana usage increases the odds of developing a mental illness, expansion of pot will expand mental health treatment needs.</p>
<p>* Efforts to legalize for age 21+  hide the motivation to attract young users and build big profits.  Legal pot mean more young users.</p>
<p>* Marijuana usage is associated with greater risk for testicular cancer in males.</p>
<p>* With universal health care, all of us will pay for the increase in medical care for those needing help from pot abuse.</p>
<p>* The number of pot-related hospitalizations in Colorado accelerated in 2009 and went out of control in the first half of 2014.</p>
<p>* Existing mental health issues, such as ADHD, anxiety and depression, greatly increase the use of drugs for self-medication.</p>
<p><strong>Mental Health, Physical Health Alike</strong></p>
<p>“We cannot promote a comprehensive system of mental health treatment and marijuana legalization, which increases permissiveness for a drug that directly contributes to mental illness,”  states former Congressman Patrick Kennedy, who fought tirelessly on behalf of parity for mental health treatment. Kennedy and policy expert Kevin Sabet promote  Smart Approaches to Marijuana.</p>
<p>* The National Alliance for Mental Illness lists four illegal drugs which cause psychosis: cannabis, LSD, methamphetamine and heroin and two classes of legal drugs, amphetamines and steroids. Pharmaceutical drugs are sold with warnings, while marijuana isn’t.</p>
<p>Sharon Levy, Chairwoman of the American Academy of Paediatrics committee on substance abuse, said “We’re losing the public health battle” and policy is being made by legalization advocates who might be misinformed about marijuana’s dangers.”</p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Although 92% of heroin users first used marijuana before going to heroin, less than half used painkillers before going to heroin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">And according to the seminal 2017 National Academy of Sciences report, “There is moderate evidence of a statistical association between cannabis use and the development of substance dependence and/or a substance abuse disorder for substances including alcohol, tobacco, and other illicit drugs.”(3)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">RECENT STUDIES WITH animals also indicate that marijuana use is connected to use and abuse of other drugs. A 2007 Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology study found that rats given THC later self -administered heroin as adults, and increased their heroin usage, while those rats that had not been treated with THC maintained a steady level of heroin intake.(4) Another 2014 study found that adolescent THC exposure in rats seemed to change the rodents’ brains, as they subsequently displayed “heroin-seeking” behaviour. Youth marijuana use could thus lead to “increased vulnerability to drug relapse in adulthood.”(5)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff"><strong>National Institutes of Health Report</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">The National Institutes of Health says that research in this area is “consistent with animal experiments showing THC’s ability to ‘prime’ the brain for enhanced responses to other drugs. For example, rats previously administered THC show heightened behavioral response not only when further exposed to THC, but also when exposed to other drugs such as morphine—a phenomenon called cross-sensitization.”(6)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Suggestions that one addictive substance replaces another ignores the problem of polysubstance abuse, the common addiction of today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Additionally, the majority of studies find that marijuana users are often polysubstance users, despite a few studies finding limited evidence that some people substitute marijuana for opiate medication. That is, people generally do not substitute marijuana for other drugs. Indeed, the National Academy of Sciences report found that “with regard to opioids, cannabis use predicted continued opioid prescriptions 1 year after injury.  Finally, cannabis use was associated with reduced odds of achieving abstinence from alcohol, cocaine, or polysubstance use after inpatient hospitalization and treatment for substance use disorders” [emphasis added].(7)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Moreover, a three-year 2016 study of adults also found that marijuana compounds problems with alcohol. Those who reported marijuana use during the first wave of the survey were more likely than adults who did not use marijuana to develop an alcohol use disorder within three years.(8) Similarly, alcohol consumption in Colorado has increased slightly since legalization.

		<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">Mass Illness from Marijuana Edibles in San Francisco There’s more potential for overdose from edibles than smoked marijuana, although the teen in Seattle who jumped to his death last December did it after smoking pot for the first time.  Two shocking incidents in California suggest that overdose emergencies will increase if that states vote to legalize marijuana in November.  Here’s a summary of recent cases of toxicity from edibles:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">· 19 people were hospitalized in San Francisco on August 7 from THC, after attending a quinceañera party.  The source is believed be marijuana-infused candies, perhaps gummy bears. Several children were among those poisoned, one as young as six.  A 9-year-old had severe difficulty breathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">· Pot brownies sent a bachelorette party to the emergency room in South Lake Tahoe over the weekend of July 30-31. Eight of the 10 women were admitted to the hospital according to the City of South Lake Tahoe’s website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">· A JAMA Paediatrics article explains the dramatic rise in children’s hospitalizations related to marijuana in Colorado since legalization.  In 10 cases, the product was not in a child-resistant container; in 40 scenarios (34%) there was poor child supervision or product storage.  Edible products were responsible for 51 (52% ) of exposures.  The report claimed that child-resistant packaging has not been as effective in reducing kids’ unintended exposure to pot as hoped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">· The report mentions the death of one child, an 11-month-old baby.  Nine of the children had symptoms so serious that they ended up in the intensive care unit of Colorado Children’s Hospital.  Two children needed breathing tubes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">· The state of Washington has a similar problem with edibles, as reported on the King County Health Department’s website.  From 2013 to May 2015, there were 46 cases of children’s intoxications related to marijuana edibles reported in Washington.  However, reporting is voluntary and the state estimates that number could be much higher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;font-size: 10pt;color: #0000ff">·  In May, a father plead guilty to deliberately giving his 4-year-old daughter marijuana-laced cake in Vancouver, Washington.  He was sentenced to two years in prison.</span></p>

		<p>It is vital that physicians—particularly psychiatrists who are on the frontlines with patients who struggle with cannabis use—are able to identify and characterize cannabis use disorders; provide education; and offer effective, evidence-based treatments. This article provides a brief overview of each of these topics by walking through clinical decision-making with a case vignette that touches on common experiences in treating a patient with cannabis use disorder.</p>
<p>A separate and important issue is screening for emerging drugs of abuse, including synthetic “marijuana” products such as K2 and spice. Although these products are chemically distinct from the psychoactive compounds in the traditional cannabis plant, some cannabis users have tried synthetic “marijuana” products because of their gross physical similarity to cannabis plant matter.</p>
<p>CASE VIGNETTE</p>
<p>Mr. M is a 43-year-old legal clerk who has been working in the same office for 20 years. He presents as a referral from his primary care physician to your outpatient psychiatry office for an initial evaluation regarding “managing some mid-life issues.” He states that while he likes his job, it is the only job he has had since graduating college and he finds the work boring, noting that most of his co-workers have gone on to law school or more senior positions in the firm. When asked what factors have prevented him from seeking different career opportunities, he states that he would “fail a drug test.” Upon further inquiry, Mr. M says he has been smoking 2 or 3 “joints” or taking a few hits off of his “vaping pen” of cannabis daily for many years, for which he spends approximately $70 to $100 a week.</p>
<p>He first used cannabis in college and initially only smoked “a couple hits” in social settings. Over time, he has needed more cannabis to “take the edge off” and has strong cravings to use daily. He reports liking how cannabis decreases his anxiety and helps him fall asleep, although he thinks the cannabis sometimes makes him “paranoid,” which results in his avoidance of family and friends.</p>
<p>More recently, he identifies conflict and regular arguments with his wife over his cannabis use—she feels it prevents him from being present with his family and is a financial burden. He admits missing an important awards ceremony for her work and sporting events for his children, for which he had to “come up with excuses,” but the truth is that he ended up smoking more than he had intended and lost track of the time.</p>
<p>Mr. M reports multiple previous unsuccessful attempts to reduce his use and 2 days when he stopped completely, which resulted in “terrible dreams,” poor sleep, sweating, no appetite, anxiety, irritability, and strong cravings for cannabis. Resumption of his cannabis use relieved these symptoms. He denies tobacco or other drug use, including use of synthetic marijuana products such as K2 or spice, and reports having a glass of wine or champagne once or twice a year for special occasions.</p>
<p><strong>The diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>In the transition from DSM IV-TR to DSM-5, cannabis use disorders, along with all substance use disorders, have been redefined in line with characterizing a spectrum of</p>
<p>pathology and impairment. The criteria to qualify for a cannabis use disorder remain the same except for the following:</p>
<p>1. The criterion for recurrent legal problems has been removed.</p>
<p>2. A new criterion for craving or a strong desire or urge to use cannabis has been added, and the terms abuse and dependence were eliminated.</p>
<p>To qualify as having a cannabis use disorder, a threshold of 2 criteria must be met. Severity of the disorder is characterized as “mild” if 2 or 3 criteria are met, “moderate” if 4 or 5 criteria are met, and “severe” if 6 or more criteria are met. Mr. M demonstrates 3 symptoms of impaired control: using longer than intended, unsuccessful efforts to cut back, and craving; 3 symptoms of social impairment: failure to fulfil home obligations, persistent problems with his wife, and reduced pursuit of occupational opportunities; 1 symptom of risky use: continued use despite paranoia; and 2 symptoms of pharmacological properties: tolerance and withdrawal. As such, he meets 9 criteria, which qualify him for a diagnosis of severe cannabis use disorder.</p>
<p>You summarize Mr. M’s 9 symptoms and counsel him about severe cannabis use disorder. He becomes upset and states that he was not aware one could develop an “addiction” to cannabis. He expresses an interest in treatment and asks what options are available.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment options</strong></p>
<p>Psychotherapeutic treatments, including motivational enhancement treatment (MET), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and contingency management (CM), have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing frequency and quantity of cannabis use, but abstinence rates remain modest and decline after treatment. Generally, MET is effective at engaging individuals who are ambivalent about treatment; CM can lead to longer periods of abstinence during treatment by incentivizing abstinence; and CBT can work to enhance abstinence following treatment (preventing relapse). Longer duration of psychotherapy is associated with better outcomes. However, access to evidence-based psychotherapy is frequently limited, and poor adherence to evidence-based psychotherapy is common.</p>
<p>In conjunction with psychotherapy, medication strategies should be considered. Because there are no FDA-approved pharmacological agents for cannabis use disorder, patients should understand during the informed consent process that all pharmacotherapies used to treat this disorder are off-label. A number of clinical trials provide evidence for the off-label use of medications in the treatment of cannabis use disorder. The current strategies for the off-label treatment of cannabis use disorder target withdrawal symptoms, aim to initiate abstinence and prevent relapse or reduce use depending on the patient’s goals, and treat psychiatric comorbidity and symptoms that may be driving cannabis use. Here we focus on the evidence supporting these key strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Targeting withdrawal and craving</strong></p>
<p>Cannabis withdrawal is defined by DSM-5 as having 3 or more of the following signs and symptoms that develop after the cessation of prolonged cannabis use:</p>
<p>• Irritability, anger, or aggression</p>
<p>• Nervousness or anxiety</p>
<p>• Sleep difficulty</p>
<p>• Decreased appetite or weight loss</p>
<p>• Restlessness</p>
<p>• Depressed mood</p>
<p>• At least one of the following physical symptoms that causes discomfort: abdominal pain, shakiness/tremors, sweating, fever, chills, or headache</p>
<p>Withdrawal symptoms may be present within the first 24 hours. Overall, they peak within the first week and persist up to 1 month following the last use of cannabis. In the case of Mr. M, insomnia, poor appetite, and irritability as well as sweating are identified, which meet DSM-5 criteria for cannabis withdrawal during the 2 days he abstained from use. He also identifies strong craving and vivid dreams, which are additional withdrawal symptoms included on marijuana withdrawal checklists in research studies, although not included in DSM-5 criteria. These and other symptoms should be considered in clinical treatment.</p>
<p>Medication treatment studies for cannabis withdrawal have hypothesized that if withdrawal symptoms can be reduced or alleviated during cessation from regular cannabis use, people will be less likely to resume cannabis use and will have better treatment outcomes. Studies have shown that dronabinol and nabilone improved multiple withdrawal symptoms, including craving; and quetiapine, zolpidem, and mirtazapine help with withdrawal-induced sleep disturbances.1-5</p>
<p>Combining dronabinol and lofexidine (an alpha-2 agonist) was superior to placebo in reducing craving, withdrawal, and self-administration during abstinence in a laboratory model. However, in a subsequent treatment trial, the combined medication treatment was not superior to placebo in reducing cannabis use or promoting abstinence.6</p>
<p>Six double-blind placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy trials in adults with cannabis use disorder have looked at withdrawal as an outcome.7 Of these studies, only dronabinol, bupropion, and gabapentin reduced withdrawal symptoms.8-10 In addition to reducing withdrawal symptoms, nabiximols/Sativex (a combination tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and cannabidiol nasal spray not available in the US) increased retention (while actively on the medication in an inpatient setting) but did not reduce outpatient cannabis use at follow-up.11</p>
<p>All of the medications available for prescription in the US can be monitored reliably with urine drug screening to assess for illicit cannabis use except dronabinol, which will result in a positive screen for cannabis. When using urine drug screening, remember that for heavy cannabis users the qualitative urine drug screen can be positive for cannabis up to a month following cessation. When selecting a medication, take into account the cost of the medication, particularly since insurance will likely not cover THC agonists such as dronabinol for this indication, and possible misuse or diversion of scheduled substances (eg, dronabinol, nabilone). In addition, monitoring for reductions in substance use and withdrawal symptoms is key.</p>
<p><strong>Abstinence initiation and relapse prevention</strong></p>
<p>Other clinical trials have looked at medications to promote abstinence by reducing stress-induced relapse, craving (not as a component of withdrawal), and the reinforcing aspects of cannabis. Of these trials, the following results show potential promise with positive findings: gabapentin reduced quantitative THC urine levels and improved cognitive functioning (in addition to decreasing withdrawal), and buspirone led to more negative urine drug screens for cannabis (although the difference was not significant compared with placebo).10,12 However, in a follow-up larger study, no differences were seen compared with placebo and women had worse cannabis use outcomes on buspirone.13</p>
<p>N-acetylcysteine resulted in twice the odds of a negative urine drug screen in young adults and adolescents (although there was no difference between adolescent groups in self-report of cannabis use).14 Gray and colleagues15 reported that no differences were seen between N-acetylcysteine and placebo (results of the trial are soon to be published). Topiramate resulted in significantly decreased grams of cannabis used but no difference in percent days used or proportion of positive urine drug screens.16 In a recent small clinical trial, reductions in cannabis use were seen with oxytocin in combination with MET.17 Studies with nabilone and long-term naltrexone administration reduced relapse and cannabis self-administration and subjective effects, respectively, which suggests promising avenues yet to be explored by clinical trials.2,18</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of psychiatric comorbidity</strong></p>
<p>Other studies have looked at the effects of treating common comorbid psychiatric disorders in adults with cannabis use disorder, postulating that if the psychiatric disorder is treated, the individual may be more likely to abstain or reduce his or her cannabis use. For example, if a person is less depressed, he may better engage in CBT for relapse prevention.</p>
<p>Fluoxetine for depression and cannabis use disorder in adolescents decreased cannabis use and depression, although there was no difference compared with placebo.19 A trial of venlafaxine for adults with depression and cannabis use disorder demonstrated less abstinence with greater withdrawal-like symptoms compared with placebo.20,21 These findings suggest that this antidepressant might not be beneficial for treatment-seeking individuals with cannabis use disorder and may actually negatively affect outcomes.</p>
<p>CASE VIGNETTE CONT&#8217;D</p>
<p>After discussing and presenting the different psychotherapy and medication treatment options to Mr. M, you and he decide to start CBT to help with abstinence initiation. In addition, you prescribe 20 mg of dronabinol up to 2 times daily in combination with 50 mg of naltrexone daily, to help globally target Mr. M’s withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse once abstinence is achieved. However, a few days later, Mr. M calls to say that his insurance will not cover the prescription for dronabinol and he cannot afford the high cost. Given his main concerns of cannabis withdrawal symptoms, you select gabapentin up to 400 mg 3 times daily and continue weekly individual CBT.</p>
<p>Mr. M calls back several days later and reports that he has made some improvements in reducing the frequency of his cannabis use, which he attributes to the medication, but he thinks he needs additional assistance. After reviewing the treatment options again, he gives informed consent to start 1200 mg of N-acetylcysteine twice daily. After 10 weeks of this medication, his urine screens are negative.</p>
<p>You continue to provide relapse prevention CBT. He reports to you that his anxiety and insomnia are almost resolved, and you suspect that withdrawal was the cause of these symptoms. He reports significant improvement in his relationship with his family and recently received a promotion at work for “going above and beyond” on a project he was given the lead.</p>
<p>Over the next 6 months, he has 2 relapses that in functional analysis with you are determined to be triggered by unsolicited contact from his former drug dealer. Together, you develop a plan to block any further contact from the drug dealer. After several months, both the gabapentin and N-acetylcysteine are tapered and discontinued. Mr. M continues to see you for biweekly therapy sessions with random drug screens every 4 to 6 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Based on the available evidence, gabapentin, THC agonists, naltrexone, and possibly N-acetylcysteine show the greatest promise in the off-label treatment of cannabis use disorders. System considerations, such as medication cost, need to be factored into the decision-making as well as combination medication and psychotherapy approaches, which—as demonstrated in the case of Mr. M—may ultimately work best. Until further research elucidates the standard of medication practices for cannabis use disorder, the best off-label medication strategy should target any co-occurring disorders as well as any identified problematic symptoms related to cannabis use and cessation of use. When available, referral for evidence-based psychotherapy should be made.</p>

        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>In The Lancet Psychiatry, Schoeler and colleagues present a study1 describing the mediating effect of medication adherence on the association between continued cannabis use and relapse risk in patients with first-episode psychosis.</p>
<p>They have previously reported a relapse rate of 36% in this patient group over a 2-year period.2 Acknowledging the potential risk of psychosis relapse related to the high proportion of patients continuing cannabis use after the onset of psychosis, the current study1 investigates the same patient group consisting of 245 patients, obtaining retrospective data on active cannabis use and medication adherence shortly after illness onset, as well as risk of relapse at 2-year follow-up. The authors find that relapse of psychosis associated with continued cannabis use is partly mediated through non-adherence to prescribed antipsychotic medication.</p>
<p>It is well established that cannabis use increases the risk of schizophrenia, not only from the early Swedish conscript studies3 but also from studies on people who use sinsemilla in London, UK, showing that high potency cannabis increases the risk of schizophrenia.4</p>
<p>Twin studies from Norway have shown that cannabis increases the risk of psychosis, even when controlling for genetic factors.5There has been discussion on the direction of the association, as none of these studies can rule out reverse causality, but it seems reasonable to conclude that cannabis is one of many stressors that can precipitate schizophrenia, at least in susceptible individuals.</p>
<p>The association between cannabis use and psychosis continues to interest clinicians and researchers. Cannabis does not precipitate psychosis in most users.3 What are the risk factors in the pathway from cannabis use to psychosis?</p>
<p>The use of cannabis in patients with psychosis can be divided into three groups: those not using cannabis, those using cannabis with few negative consequences, and those in whom cannabis use is followed by relapse and worsening of the disease. Too little effort has been put into studying people with psychosis who can use cannabis without many negative consequences.</p>
<p>Further research should also be put into different variants of cannabis. Strains cultured to produce high content of D-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably associated with higher risk for psychosis than those strains with less THC.4 In healthy participants, cannabidiol has been shown to inhibit THC-elicited paranoid symptoms and hippocampal-dependent memory impairment.6 The use of more balanced forms of cannabis could possibly be less detrimental to mental health.</p>
<p>Genetic predisposition is one factor that is related to the development of psychosis after the use of cannabis.5 However, there is still a long way to go in clarifying the interplay between genes and environmental factors in the cannabis–psychosis association. Therefore, we support the request for doing more studies to investigate the possible interaction between polygenic risk score for schizophrenia and cannabis use in causing psychosis.7</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a need to examine the use of antipsychotic medication and investigate if some medications are particularly useful for patients with psychotic disorders who intend to continue to use cannabis. In a randomised trial comparing the effects of different antipsychotics,8 clozapine seemed to stand out in reducing craving for cannabis, a finding that is in need of replication.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that stopping cannabis use after a first episode of psychosis has beneficial outcomes compared with continued use.9 A meta-analysis of observational studies published in 201710 compared adherence to antipsychotic medication between cannabis users and non-users, and found that cannabis use increases the risk of non-adherence to anti-psychotic medication and quitting cannabis may help adherence to antipsychotics. In the current study by Schoeler and colleagues,1 the authors found that adherence to medication was a possible mediator in the association between cannabis use and risk of psychosis relapse when taking potential confounders into account. They found that medication adherence partly mediated the effect of continued cannabis use on outcome, including risk of relapse (proportion mediated=26%, pindirecteffects=0·040, 95% CI 0·004–0·16), number of relapses (36%, pindirect effects=0·040, 0·003–0·14), time to relapse (28%, pindirect effects=0·051, −0·53 to 0·001), and care intensity (20%, pindirect effects=0·035, 0·004–0·11), but not length of relapse (6%, pindirect effects=0·35, −0·030 to 0·09).</p>
<p>Acknowledging the complexity of psychosis relapse prevention, the current findings point to reduction in cannabis use as an intervention target to improve medication adherence, thereby preventing psychosis relapse. The understanding of a triangular association of ongoing cannabis use with medication adherence and psychosis relapse may be a step forward in counteracting further psychotic episodes in some patients.</p>

		<p>Investigating the proposition that cannabis is worth bothering with, this hot topic looks at reports that stronger cannabis on the market is increasing harms to users, prospects of recovery from disorders and dependence, and the emerging response to synthetic forms of cannabis like ‘spice’.</p>
<p>CANNABIS IN THE LAW</p>
<p>A controlled ‘Class B’ substance, cannabis carries legal penalties for possession, supply, and production. Between 2004–2009 cannabis was reclassified as a ‘Class C’ substance, meaning for a brief period of time it carried lesser penalties for possession. In 2009, the Association of Chief Police Officers issued new guidance, advising officers to take an escalating approach to the policing of cannabis possession for personal use: • A warning • A penalty notice for disorder (PND) • Arrest</p>
<p>This three-tiered approach was designed to be “ethical and non-discriminatory”, but also reinforce the “national message that cannabis is harmful and remains illegal”.</p>
<p>In 1990s Britain a common reaction to allocating resources to treating cannabis users was, ‘Why bother? We have more than enough patients with problems with serious drugs like heroin.’ The typically calming use of the drug by adults was seen as preferable to the main alternative – alcohol and its associated violence and disorder. Calls for a treatment response were seen as pathologising what in many societies is both normal and in some ways desirable youth development: trying new experiences, challenging conventions, and exposing the hypocrisy of alcohol-drinking adults. In 1997 the Independent on Sunday launched a campaign to decriminalise cannabis, culminating in a mass ‘roll-up’, and 16,000-strong pro-cannabis march from Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square. Its Editor Rosie Boycott wrote in the paper about her own coming-of-age experience smoking cannabis, telling readers:</p>
<p>“I Rolled my first joint on a hot June day in Hyde Park. Summer of ’68. Just 17. Desperate to be grown-up. … My first smoke, a mildly giggly intoxication, was wholly anti-climatic. The soggy joint fell apart. I didn’t feel changed. But that act turned me – literally – into an outlaw. I was on the other side of the fence from the police – or the fuzz, as we used to call them. So were a great many of my generation.”</p>
<p>The campaign was explosive, but short-lived, apparently subsiding when Boycott left to take up her role as Editor of the Daily Express. A decade later, the Independent issued an apology for the campaign. ‘If only they had known then, what they knew now’, was the message of the article, referring to the reportedly damaging impact of the more potent strains of cannabis and its links to “mental health problems and psychosis for thousands of teenagers”.</p>
<p><strong>Are stronger strains creating more problems?</strong></p>
<p>There has been a long-standing, but controversial, association between cannabis strength and harm. Reading newspaper articles on the subject, it wouldn’t be unusual to see a headline drawing a straight line between ‘super-strength skunk’ and addiction, violence, deaths, or psychosis. In 2008, then Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke in a similar vein, telling a breakfast-television viewing audience:</p>
<p>I have always been worried about cannabis, with this new skunk, this more lethal part of cannabis.</p>
<p>I don’t think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and we really have got to send out a message to young people – this is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Brown was warning of a dangerous new strain of cannabis on the market, that caused very severe harms to users – contrasting starkly with the common perception of cannabis as a ‘low harm’ or ‘no harm’ drug. The strength or potency of cannabis is determined by the amount of ‘THC’ it contains. THC produces the ‘high’ associated with cannabis, and another major component ‘CBD’ produces the sedative and anti-anxiety effects. As well as potency, the relative amounts of THC and CBD are important for understanding the effects of cannabis – something explored in a University College London study during the programme Drugs Live: Cannabis on Trial. The research team compared two different types of cannabis: the first had high levels of THC (approx. 13%) but virtually no CBD; and the second had a lower level of THC (approx. 6.5%) and substantial amounts of CBD (approx. 8%). They found that CBD had a moderating or protective effect on some of the negative effects of THC, and that “many of the effects that people enjoy are still present in low-potency varieties without some of the harms associated with the high-potency varieties”. At least in the US over the last two decades (between 1995–2014), potency has increased from around 4% to 12%, and the protective CBD content of cannabis has decreased, from around 28% to less than 15%, significantly affecting the ratio of THC to CBD, and with it, the nature and strength of the psychoactive effect of cannabis. Until the 1990s, herbal cannabis sold in the UK was predominantly imported from the Caribbean, West Africa, and Asia. After this time, it was increasingly produced in the UK, being grown indoors using intensive means (artificial lighting, heating, and control of day-length). A study funded by the Home Office analysed samples of cannabis confiscated by 23 police forces in England and Wales in 2008, and found that over 97% of herbal cannabis had been grown by intensive methods; its average potency of 16% compared with just 8% for traditional imported herbal cannabis. This matched other reports of home-grown cannabis being consistently (around 2–3 times) stronger than imported herbal cannabis and cannabis resin.</p>
<p>In 2015, observing a decrease in the use of cannabis in England and Wales, but parallel increase in demand for treatment, a UK study examined whether the trend could be explained by an increase in the availability of higher-potency cannabis. Over 2500 adults were surveyed about their use of different types of cannabis, severity of dependence, and cannabis-related concerns. The researchers found that higher potency cannabis was associated with a greater severity of dependence, especially in young people, and was rated by participants as causing more memory impairment and paranoia than lower potency types. However at the same time, it was reported to produce the best ‘high’, and to be the preferred type.</p>
<p>By definition cannabis is a psychoactive substance, which means it can change people’s perceptions, mood, and behaviour. Higher potency cannabis contains more of the psychoactive component, so it makes sense that higher potency cannabis could increase the risk of temporary or longer-term (adverse) problems with perceptions, mood, and behaviour. However, there is a particular concern that cannabis use could be linked to ‘psychosis’, a term describing a mental illness where a person perceives or interprets reality in a very different way to those around them, which can include hallucinations or delusions.</p>
<p>Whether cannabis causes psychosis, precipitates an existing predisposition, aggravates an existing condition, or has no impact at all on psychotic symptoms, has for decades been hotly contested. With our focus on evaluations of interventions, Drug and Alcohol Findings is in no position to pronounce on this issue, nor on the possibility that the drug might sometimes improve mental health, but some examples of research informing this debate are included below. A 2009 UK study examined whether daily use of high-potency cannabis was linked to an elevated risk of psychosis, comparing 280 patients in London presenting with a first episode of psychosis with a healthy control group. The patients were found to be more likely to smoke cannabis on a daily basis than the control group, and to have smoked for more than five years. Among those who used cannabis, 78% of the patients who had experienced psychosis used higher-potency cannabis, compared with 37% of those in the control group. The findings indicated that the risk of psychosis was indeed greater among the people who were using high potency cannabis on a frequent basis, but couldn’t show that the cannabis use caused the psychosis, or even that the cannabis use made the group more susceptible to psychosis. The wider literature on mental health and substance use would suggest that the association is more complex than this. A recently published paper from the University of York has demonstrated the complications of attributing any association between cannabis use and psychosis to a causal effect of cannabis use rather than other factors or a reverse causal effect. A calculation based on data from England and Wales helped to put this into perspective, indicating that even if cannabis did cause psychosis more than 20,000 people would need to be stopped using cannabis to prevent just one case of psychosis. The apparent steady increase in cannabis potency in the UK since the 1990s is important context for further research. Where higher potency cannabis is increasingly becoming the norm, and is the preference for cannabis users, it would be relevant to generate more evidence of the health-related problems with high potency cannabis, and the treatment and harm reduction solutions based around these health-related problems.</p>
<p><strong>Cannabis accounts for half of all new drug treatment patients</strong></p>
<p>The most widely used illegal drug in Europe, many seemingly enjoy cannabis without it leading to any significant negative social or health effects. However, numbers entering treatment for cannabis use problems have been on the rise (both in the UK, and the rest of Europe), while heroin treatment numbers have fallen  chart. According to Public Health England, this is not because more people are using cannabis, but perhaps because services relieved of some of the recent pressure of opiate user numbers are giving more priority to cannabis, because they are making themselves more amenable to cannabis users, and because of emerging issues with stronger strains of the drug. Whatever the causes, across the UK figures submitted to the European drug misuse monitoring centre show that the proportion of patients starting treatment for drug problems who did so primarily due to their cannabis use rose steadily from 11% in 2003/04 to 22% in 2011/12. With the caveat that data from 2013 onwards is not directly comparabledue to changes in methodology, in 2014 and 2015 the proportion of patients who entered treatment primarily because of a cannabis issue hovered above previous years at 26% (25,278 and 26,295 respectively). Among first ever treatment presentations, the increase from 2003/04 was more pronounced, from 19% to 37%. By 2013, cannabis use had become the main prompt for half the patients who sought treatment for the first time (at 49%), and stayed relatively constant at 47% in 2014, and 48% in 2015.</p>
<p>Showing that more users was not the reason for more starting treatment, over about the same period, in England and Wales the proportion of 16–59-year-olds who in a survey said they had used cannabis in the past year fell from about 11% to 7% in 2013/14, then stayed at that level in 2014/15 and 2015/16. The treatment figures largely reflect trends in England, where in 2013/14 the number of patients starting treatment with cannabis use problems had risen to 30,422, 21% of all treatment starters, up from 23,018 and 19% in 2005/06. Subsequently the number dropped to 27,965 in 2015/16, still around a fifth of all treatment starters. Among the total treatment population – starting or continuing in treatment – cannabis numbers rose from 40,240 in 2005/06 to peak at 64,407 in 2013/14 before falling back to 59,918 in 2015/16; corresponding proportions again hovered around a fifth. As a primary problem substance among under-18s cannabis dominated, accounting for three-quarters of all patients in treatment in 2015/16 and in numbers, 12,863. The dominance of cannabis increased from 2008/09 as numbers primarily in treatment for drinking problems fell.</p>
<p><strong>‘All treatments appear to work’</strong></p>
<p>According to the two main diagnostic manuals used in Europe and the USA, problem cannabis use can develop into a cannabis use disorder or cannabis dependence, identifiable by a cluster of symptoms including: loss of control; inability to cut down or stop; preoccupation with use; neglecting activities unrelated to use; continued use despite experiencing problems; and the development of tolerance and withdrawal. This level of clinical appreciation for cannabis use problems didn’t exist when researcher and writer William L. White entered the addictions field half a century ago:</p>
<p>“When I first entered the rising addiction treatment system in the United States nearly half a century ago, there existed no clinical concept of cannabis dependence and thus no concept of recovery from this condition. In early treatment settings, cannabis was not consider[ed] a “real” drug, the idea of cannabis addiction was scoffed at as remnants of “Reefer Madness,” and casual cannabis use was not uncommon among early staff working in addiction treatment programs of the 1960s. Many in the field remain sceptical of the idea of cannabis dependence, specifically whether problem users at the severe end experience physiological withdrawal. However, reviewing what they believe is mounting evidence, these authors suggest there can be confidence in the existence of a “true withdrawal syndrome” – albeit one that differs qualitatively from the “significant medical or psychiatric problems as observed in some cases of opioid, alcohol, or benzodiazepine withdrawals”. In the case of cannabis, the main symptoms are primarily emotional and behavioural, although appetite change, weight loss, and some physical discomfort are reported. A brief review aimed at practitioners in UK primary care provides guidance on how to manage symptoms of withdrawal among patients trying to stop or reduce their cannabis use.</p>
<p>Research has come a long way, says William L. White, with now “clear data supporting the dependency producing properties of cannabis, a clear conceptualization of cannabis use disorders (CUD) and cannabis dependence (CD)”, but until recently, very little evidence about the prospects of long-term recovery. Yet, key papers – found here and here – indicate that:</p>
<p>• Full remission from cannabis use disorders is not only possible, but probable.</p>
<p>• Stable remission takes time – an average of 33 months.</p>
<p>• Abstinence may not be initially realistic for heavy cannabis users – but those in  remission are usually able to reduce the intensity of their use and its  consequences.</p>
<p>At least in the United States, it seems dependence is more quickly overcome from cannabis than the main legal drugs. A survey of the US general adult population found that within a year of first becoming dependent, 3% each of smokers and drinkers were in remission and remained so until they were surveyed. For cannabis the figure was nearly 5% and for cocaine, nearly 9%. After ten years the proportions in remission had risen to 18% for nicotine, 37% for alcohol, 66% for cannabis and 76% for cocaine. About 26 years after first becoming dependent, half the people at some time dependent on nicotine were in remission, a milestone reached for alcohol after 14 years, for cannabis six years, and for cocaine, five.</p>
<p><strong>Specialised treatment programmes for cannabis users in European countries</strong></p>
<p>Generally for people with cannabis use problems, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction concluded in 2015, and before that in 2008, that “all treatments appear to work”. For adults, effective treatments include motivational interviewing, motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy, and for younger people, family-based therapies seem most beneficial. Less important than the type of treatment is the treatment context and the individual’s determination to overcome their problems through treatment. And there is “no firm basis for a conclusion” that cannabis-specific interventions (designed around the risks and harms associated with cannabis) are more effective than general substance use treatment tailored to the individual needs of the cannabis user seeking treatment chart. In some studies brief interventions have been found to work just as well as more intensive treatment, but when the patients are heavily dependent, and the most difficult cases are not filtered out by the research, longer and more individualised therapies can have the advantage. When the World Health Organization trialled its ASSIST substance use screening and brief advice programme in Australia, India, the United States, and Brazil, just over half the identified patients (all had to be at moderate risk of harm but probably not dependent) were primarily problem cannabis users. Among these, risk reduction in relation to this drug was significantly greater among patients allocated to a brief advice session than among those placed on a three-month waiting list for advice. In each country too, risk reduction was greater among intervention patients, except for the USA, where the order was reversed. Suggesting that severity of use was not a barrier to reacting well to brief intervention, only patients at the higher end of the moderate risk spectrum further reduced their cannabis use/risk scores following intervention. The ASSIST study was confined to adults, but young people in secondary schools in the USA whose problem substance use focused mainly on cannabis also reacted well to brief advice.</p>
<p>The relative persistence of opiate use problems versus the transitory nature of those primarily related to cannabis seemed reflected in an analysis of treatment entrants in England from 1 April 2005 to the end of 2013/14, the last time this particular analysis was published. At the end of this period just 7% of primary cannabis users were still in or back in treatment compared to the 30% overall figure and 36% for primary opiate users. The figure peaked at 43% for users of opiates and crack. Over half – 53% – of primary cannabis users had left treatment as planned, apparently having overcome their cannabis problems, compared to 27% of primary opiate users and just 20% with dual opiates and crack use problems. Another 40% of cannabis users had left treatment in an unplanned manner, a slightly higher proportion than among opiate users. The figures tell a tale of relatively high level of success which enables cannabis users to leave treatment, though even in the absence of recorded success, few stay long-term.</p>
<p>However, the forms patients in England complete with their keyworkers while in treatment seem to tell a different story. Compared to how they started treatment, around six months later 45% of primary cannabis users were assessed as using just as often (including a few using more), compared to 30% of opiate users and 42% whose main problem drugs were both opiates and crack, suggesting more rapid and/or more complete remission for opiate users than for cannabis users. One interpretation is that the widespread use of substitute drugs like methadone more reliably reduced the illegal opiate use of opiate users and also helped retain them in treatment, while cannabis users tended quickly to leave treatment, having done well or not. However, these figures relate only to patients who completed the forms at their six-month review, which in practice could have happened anywhere from about one to six months after their assessment for treatment. What proportion of primary cannabis users were still in treatment at that point and available to complete the forms is not clear, but they may have been the patients whose problems were deep seated enough to require extended treatment.</p>
<p>Enjoyable and trouble-free for many, but not without harms Harm reduction – the “set of practical strategies and ideas aimed at reducing negative consequences associated with drug use” – is mostly associated with ‘harder’ drugs like heroin, for which blood-borne viruses and drug-related deaths are clear and severe risks. Yet while “many people experience cannabis as enjoyable and trouble free”, there are also varying degrees of harm with this drug depending on the characteristics of the person using, the type of the cannabis, and the way they consume it. Many formal cannabis harm reduction programmes borrow from the fields of alcohol and tobacco. Advice includes:</p>
<p>• safer modes of administration (eg, on the use of vaporisers, on rolling safer joints, on less risky modes of inhaling) Many people experience cannabis as enjoyable and trouble free … some people require help to reduce or stop</p>
<p>• skills to prevent confrontation with those who disapprove of use</p>
<p>• encouraging users to moderate their use</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• discouraging mixing cannabis with other drugs</p>
<p>• drug driving prevention and controls</p>
<p>• reducing third-party exposure to second-hand smoke</p>
<p>• education about spotting signs of problematic use</p>
<p>• self-screening for problematic use</p>
<p>In some parts of the UK, National Health Service tobacco smoking cessation services incorporated cannabis into their interventions with adults; and Health Scotland, also addressing the risks of tobacco and cannabis smoking, published a booklet for young people titled Fags ‘n’ Hash: the essential guide to cutting down the risks of using tobacco and cannabis.</p>
<p>Vaporising or swallowing cannabis offers a way to avoid respiratory risks, but only a minority of cannabis do this, most choosing to smoke cannabis joints (or cannabis and tobacco joints). While not all will know about the different health risks, cannabis users may choose against safer consumption methods anyway for a range of reasons (including their own thoughts about safe use):</p>
<p>• Users may find it easier to control the effects (eg, severity, length of effect) of cannabis when inhaling in the form of a joint or spliff</p>
<p>• Preparing and sharing joints can be an enjoyable part of the routine, or part of a person’s social activities</p>
<p>• Alternative methods of smoking (eg, bongs and vaporisers) may be inconvenient to use, or expensive to buy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most harm reduction advice is delivered informally long before users come into contact with drugs professionals – for example through cannabis magazines, websites, and headshops – highlighting the importance of official sources engaging with non-official sources to promote the delivery of accurate, evidence-based harm reduction messages.</p>
<p><strong>A new high</strong></p>
<p>In May 2016 the Psychoactive Substances Act placed a ‘blanket ban’ on new psychoactive substances (previously known as ‘legal highs’), including synthetic cannabinoids (synthetic forms of cannabis). Prior to this, in 2014, there had been 163 reported deaths from new psychoactive substances in the UK, and 204 the year after. The average age was around 28, younger than the average age for other drug misuse deaths of around 38. The fact that these psychoactive substances – which produced similar effects to illicit drugs like cannabis, cocaine, and ecstasy – could be bought so easily online or on the high street, appeared inconsistent; and each fatality prompted “an outcry for something to be done to prevent further tragedies”. This was the context (and arguably the political trigger) for the introduction of the Psychoactive Substances Act. While possession of a psychoactive substance as such wasn’t criminalised;, production, supply, offer to supply, possession with intent to supply, import or export were – with a maximum penalty of seven years’ imprisonment.</p>
<p>Just seven months after the Act came into effect, the Home Office labelled it a success, with a press release stating that nearly 500 people had been arrested, 332 shops around the UK had been stopped from selling the substances, and four people had been sent to prison. But did the Psychoactive Substances Act have the presumably desired effect of limiting access to psychoactive substances (and reducing deaths), or did it just push the drugs the way of dealers? It is perhaps too early to tell, but former chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs Professor Nutt had warned before the Act came into effect that the ‘blanket ban’ would make it harder (not easier) to control drugs. And while Chief executive of DrugWise Harry Shapiro had said the new law would make new psychoactive substances harder to obtain, he also agreed that sale of the drugs would not cease, but merely be diverted to the illicit market: “The same people selling heroin and crack will simply add this to their repertoire.” The paper “From niche to stigma” examined the changing face of the new psychoactive substance user between 2009 and 2016, focusing on people using the synthetic cannabis known as ‘spice’. It looked at the transition of (then) ‘legal highs’ from an “experimental and recreational” scene associated with a “niche middle class demographic”, to “those with degrees of stigma”, especially homeless, prison, and socially vulnerable youth populations (including looked after children, those involved in or at risk of offending, and those excluded or at risk of exclusion from mainstream education). In 2014, the DrugScope Street Drug Survey also observed a problem among these particular groups, recording a “rapid rise in the use of synthetic cannabinoids such as Black Mamba and Exodus Damnation by opiate users, the street homeless, socially excluded teenagers and by people in prison”.</p>
<p>‘SPICE’ AND OTHER SYNTHETICS</p>
<p>Cannabis contains two key components:</p>
<p>• ‘THC’ (tetrahydrocannabinol), which produces the ‘high’</p>
<p>• ‘CBD’ (cannabidiol), which produces the sedative and anti-anxiety effects</p>
<p>Synthetic forms of cannabis contain chemicals that aim to copy the effects of ‘THC’ in cannabis. But the effects of synthetic cannabis can be quite different (and often stronger): firstly, because synthetic production makes it easier to manipulate the amount of the THC-like chemical; and secondly, because of the absence of the moderating equivalent of ‘CBD’. Some synthetics are purposely designed to resemble herbal cannabis, and can be consumed in the same ways (eg, smoked or inhaled). The names also often have deliberate cannabis connotations. The risk of this is that people wishing to take cannabis may be initially unaware that they have been sold the synthetic form, or may believe from the look of it that it will produce similar sought-after effects. The greater intensity of synthetic cannabis at lower dose levels ( box) ensures that it has an appeal in terms of potency and affordability, but may put those with fewer resources at greater harm.</p>
<p>In 2014, the prison inspectorate for England and Wales raised concerns about the rise in the use of psychoactive substances in prisons, in particular synthetic cannabis. A study set in an English adult male prison found that the nature of the market was posing significant challenges to the management of offenders. There, the primary motivation for consumption was being able to take a substance without it being detected. Given this motivation, and the greater likelihood of harms from synthetic versus natural cannabis, the researchers concluded that it was imperative for mandatory drug-testing policies to be revised, and instead rooted in harm reduction – something which would also apply to people on probation subject to mandatory drug-testing.</p>
<p>Cannabis throws up a range of issues rather different from those associated with the drugs treatment in the UK has normally focused on. If current trends continue, understanding the findings will become yet more important to British treatment services.</p>

		<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Drug addiction is a chronic and relapsing disease that often begins during adolescence.</p>
<p>Epidemiological evidence documents an association between marijuana use during adolescence and subsequent abuse of drugs such as heroin and cocaine (1, 2). While many factors including societal pressures, family, culture, and drug availability can contribute to this apparent `gateway&#8217; association, little is known about the neurobiological basis underlying such potential vulnerability.</p>
<p>Of the neural substrates that have been investigated, the enkephalinergic opioid system is  consistently altered by developmental marijuana exposure (3–5), perhaps reflecting neuroanatomical interactions between cannabinoid receptor type 1 and the enkephalinergic system (6, 7).</p>
<p>Debates exist, however, regarding the relationship between proenkephalin (Penk) dysregulation and opiate susceptibility. We previously reported that adult rats exposed to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; primary psychoactive component of marijuana) during adolescence exhibit increased heroin self administration (SA) as well as increased expression of Penk, the gene encoding the opioid neuropeptide enkephalin, in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcsh), a mesolimbic structure critically involved in reward-related behaviors (3).</p>
<p>Although these data suggest that increased NAcsh Penk expression and heroin SA behavior are independent consequences of adolescent THC exposure, they do not address a possible causal relationship between THCinduced  Penk upregulation in NAcsh and enhanced behavioral susceptibility to opiates.</p>
<p>Moreover, insights regarding the neurobiological mechanisms by which adolescent THC exposure maintains upregulation of Penk into adulthood remain unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we take advantage of viral-mediated gene transfer strategies to show that adulthood addiction-like behaviors induced by adolescent THC exposure are dependent on discrete regulation of NAcsh Penk gene expression. A number of recent studies have demonstrated an important role for histone methylation in the regulation of drug-induced behaviors and transcriptional plasticity, particularly alteration of repressive histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation at NAc gene promotors (8, 9).</p>
<p>We report here that one mechanism by which adolescent THC exposure may mediate Penk upregulation in adult NAcsh is through reduction of H3K9 di- and trimethylation, a functional consequence of which may be decreased transcriptional repression of Penk.</p>
<p>ABSTRACT</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Marijuana use by teenagers often predates the use of harder drugs, but the neurobiological underpinnings of such vulnerability are unknown. Animal studies suggest enhanced heroin self-administration (SA) and dysregulation of the endogenous opioid system in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcsh) of adults following adolescent Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure. However, a causal link between Penk expression and vulnerability to heroin has yet to be established.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>To investigate the functional significance of NAcsh  Penk tone, selective viral mediated knockdown and overexpression of Penk was performed, followed by analysis of subsequent heroin SA behavior. To determine whether adolescent THC exposure was associated with chromatin alteration, we analyzed levels of histone H3 methylation in the NAcsh via ChIP atfive sites flanking the Penk gene transcription start site.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Here, we show that regulation of the proenkephalin (Penk) opioid neuropeptide gene in NAcsh directly regulates heroin SA behavior. Selective viral-mediated knockdown of Penk in striatopallidal neurons attenuates heroin SA in adolescent THC-exposed rats, whereas Penk overexpression potentiates heroin SA in THC-naïve rats. Furthermore, we report that adolescent THC exposure mediates Penk upregulation through reduction of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation in the NAcsh, thereby disrupting the normal developmental pattern of H3K9 methylation.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>These data establish a direct association between THC-induced NAcsh Penk upregulation and heroin SA and indicate that epigenetic dysregulation of Penk underlies the long term effects of THC.</p>

		<p>Cannabis has recently been legalised in many US states</p>
<p>Cannabis itself is harmful to cardiovascular health and increases the chance of early death regardless of related factors such as smoking tobacco, new research reveals.</p>
<p>Data taken from more than 1,000 US hospitals found that people who used the drug had a 26 per cent higher chance of suffering a stroke than those who did not, and a 10 per cent higher chance of having a heart attack.</p>
<p>The findings held true after taking into account unhealthy factors known to affect many cannabis smokers, such as obesity, alcohol misuse and smoking.</p>
<p>‘This leads us to believe that there is something else going on besides just obesity or diet-related cardiovascular side effects’ Dr Aditi Kalla, Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia</p>
<p>They indicate there is something intrinsic about cannabis which can damage the proper functioning of the human heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even when we corrected for known risk factors, we still found a higher rate of both stroke and heart failure in these patients, so that leads us to believe that there is something else going on besides just obesity or diet-related cardiovascular side effects,” said Dr Aditi Kalla, Cardiology Fellow at the Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia and the study&#8217;s lead author.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important for physicians to know these effects so we can better educate patients.”</p>
<p>Previous research in cell cultures has shown that heart muscle cells have cannabis receptors relevant to contractility, or squeezing ability, suggesting that those receptors might be one mechanism through which marijuana use could affect the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>The research team analysed more than 20 million records of young and middle-aged patients aged between 18 and 55 who were discharged from 1,000 hospitals in 2009 and 2010, when marijuana use was illegal in most states.</p>
<p>It identified 316,000 patients &#8211; 1.5 per cent &#8211; where marijuana use was diagnosed in the notes.  Their cardiovascular disease rates were compared to those who shunned the drug.</p>
<p>The research was published yesterday at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Washington DC.</p>

		<p>Findings From A UK Birth Cohort</p>
<p>ABSTRACT</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Evidence on the role of cannabis as a gateway drug is inconsistent. We characterise patterns of cannabis use among UK teenagers aged 13–18 years, and assess their influence on problematic substance use at age 21 years.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>We used longitudinal latent class analysis to derive trajectories of cannabis use from self-report measures in a UK birth cohort. We investigated (1) factors associated with latent class membership and (2) whether latent class membership predicted subsequent nicotine dependence, harmful alcohol use and recent use of other illicit drugs at age 21 years.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>5315 adolescents had three or more measures of cannabis use from age 13 to 18 years. Cannabis use patterns were captured as four latent classes corresponding to ‘non-users’ (80.1%), ‘late-onset occasional’ (14.2%), ‘early-onset occasional’ (2.3%) and ‘regular’ users (3.4%).</p>
<p>Sex, mother&#8217;s substance use, and child&#8217;s tobacco use, alcohol consumption and conduct problems were strongly associated with cannabis use.</p>
<p>At age 21 years, compared with the non-user class, late-onset occasional, early-onset occasional and regular cannabis user classes had higher odds of nicotine dependence (OR=3.5, 95% CI 0.7 to 17.9; OR=12.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 150.3; and OR=37.2, 95% CI 9.5 to 144.8, respectively); harmful alcohol consumption (OR=2.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.3; OR=5.0, 95% CI 2.1 to 12.1; and OR=2.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 7.1, respectively); and other illicit drug use (OR=22.7, 95% CI 11.3 to 45.7; OR=15.9, 95% CI 3.9 to 64.4; and OR=47.9, 95% CI 47.9 to 337.0, respectively).</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>One-fifth of the adolescents in our sample followed a pattern of occasional or regular cannabis use, and these young people were more likely to progress to harmful substance use behaviours in early adulthood.</p>

		<p>It comes as no surprise that the prevalence of marijuana use has significantly increased over the last decade. With marijuana legal for recreational use in four states and the District of Columbia and for medical use in an additional 31 states, the public perception about marijuana has shifted, with more people reporting that they support legalization. However, there is little public awareness, and close to zero media attention, to the near-doubling of past year marijuana use nationally among adults age 18 and older and the corresponding increase in problems related to its use. Because the addiction rate for marijuana remains stable—with about one in three past year marijuana users experiencing a marijuana use disorder—the total number of Americans with marijuana use disorders also has significantly increased. It is particularly disturbing that the public is unaware of the fact that of all Americans with substance use disorders due to drugs other than alcohol; nearly 60 percent are due to marijuana. That means that more Americans are addicted to marijuana than any other drug, including heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, and the nonmedical use of prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Stores in Colorado and Washington with commercialized marijuana sell innovative marijuana products offering users record-high levels of THC potency. Enticing forms of marijuana, including hash oil used in discreet vaporizer pens and edibles like cookies, candy and soda are attractive to users of all ages, particularly those underage. The legal marijuana producers are creatively and avidly embracing these new trends in marijuana product development, all of which encourage not only more users but also more intense marijuana use.</p>
<p>Yet despite the expansion of state legal marijuana markets, the illegal market for marijuana remains robust, leaving state regulators two uncomfortable choices: either a ban can be placed on the highest potency—and most enticing—marijuana products which will push the legal market back to products with more moderate levels of THC, or the current evolution to ever-more potent and more attractive products can be considered acceptable despite its considerable negative health and safety consequences. If tighter regulations are the chosen option, the illegal market will continue to exploit the desire of marijuana users to consume more potent and attractive products. If state governments let the market have its way, there will be no limit to the potency of legally marketed addicting marijuana products.</p>
<p>The illegal marijuana market thrives in competition with the legal market by offering products at considerably lower prices because it neither complies with regulations on growth and sale, nor pays taxes on sales or their profits. Unsurprisingly, much of the illegal marijuana in the states with legalized marijuana is diverted from the local legal marijuana supply. It is troubling that in response to the decline in demand for Mexican marijuana, Mexican cartels are increasing the production of heroin, a more lucrative drug.</p>
<p>When alcohol prohibition ended in 1933, bootlegged alcohol gradually and almost completely disappeared. Those who favour drug legalization are confident that the same will occur in the market for drugs; they argue that legalizing drugs will eliminate the illegal market with all its negative characteristics including violence and corruption. The initial experience with marijuana legalization shows that this is dangerous, wishful thinking. Why doesn’t legalization now work for marijuana as it did for alcohol 80 years ago? One obvious reason is that there is little similarity between the bootleg industry of alcohol production that existed during prohibition and contemporary drug trafficking organizations. Today’s illegal drug production and distribution system is deeply entrenched, highly sophisticated, and powerfully globalized. Traffickers are resourceful and able to rapidly to adjust to changes in the market, including competing with legal drugs.</p>
<p>The legalization of marijuana or any other drug is making a bargain with the devil. All drugs of abuse, legal and illegal, including marijuana, produce intense brain reward that users value highly—so highly that they are willing to pay high prices and suffer serious negative consequences for their use. Marijuana users’ brains do not know the difference between legal and illegal marijuana, but, as with other drugs, the brain prefers higher potency products. Drug suppliers, legal and illegal, are eager to provide the drugs that users prefer.</p>
<p>The challenge of drug policy today is to find better ways to reduce drug use by using strategies that are cost-effective and compatible with modern values. Legalization fails this test because it encourages drug use. Most of the costs of drug use are the result of the drug use itself and not from efforts to curb that use. It is hard to imagine a drug user who would be better off with having more drugs available at cheaper prices. Supply matters. More supply means more use. Drug legalization enhances drug supply and reduces social disapproval of drugs.</p>
<p>Our nation must prepare itself for the serious negative consequences both to public health and safety from the growth of marijuana use fuelled by both the legal and the illegal marijuana markets.</p>

		<p><strong>Cannabis Use, Gender and the Brain</strong></p>
<p>Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in the U.S. and, as a result of legalization efforts for both medical remedy and for recreational use, is now the second leading reason (behind alcohol) for admission to addiction treatment in the U.S. The health consequences, cognitive changes, academic performance and numerous neuroadaptations have been debated ad nauseam. Like other drugs and medications, effects are different if exposure occurs in the young vs. the old or in males vs. females. Exposure in utero, early childhood, adolescence-young adult, adult and elderly may have different effects on the brain and outcomes. Yet the best available independent research shows that marijuana use is associated with consistent regionally specific alterations to important brain circuitry in the striatum and pre-frontal and post orbital regions. In this study, Chye and colleagues have investigated the association between marijuana use and the size of specific brain regions that are vitally important in goal-directed behavior, focus and learning within in the orbitol frontal cortex (OFC) and caudate. This investigation suggests that marijuana dependence and recreational use have distinct and region-specific effects.</p>
<p><strong>Why Does This Matter?</strong></p>
<p>This is an important finding, but distinction between cannabis use, abuse and dependence is not always clear, objective, linear or well understood. However, dependence-related medial OFC volume reduction was robust and highly significant. Lateral OFC volume reduction was associated with monthly marijuana use. Greater reductions in brain volume of specific regions were stronger among females who were marijuana dependent. This finding correlates with previous evidence of gender-dependent differences towards the various physiological, behavioral and the reinforcing effect of marijuana for both recreational use and addiction.</p>
<p>The results highlight important neurological distinctions between occasional cannabis use and addiction. Specifically, Chye and colleagues found that smaller medial OFC volume may be driven by marijuana addiction-related mechanisms, while smaller lateral OFC volume may be due to ongoing exposure to cannabinoids. The results highlight a distinction between cannabis use and dependence and warrant future examination of gender-specific effects in studies of marijuana use and dependence.</p>

		<p>Today, Dr. Kevin Sabet, president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM), a national group promoting evidence-based marijuana laws, issued the following statement regarding medical marijuana legislation introduced by Senators Booker (D-NJ) and Gillibrand (D-NY) and Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN):</p>
<p>&#8220;No one wants to deprive chronically ill patients of medication that could be helpful for them, but that&#8217;s not what the legislation being introduced today is about. We wouldn&#8217;t allow Pfizer to bypass the FDA &#8211; why would we let the marijuana industry? This bill would completely undermine the FDA approval process, and encourage the use of marijuana and marijuana products that have not been proven either safe or effective. The FDA approval process should set the standard for smart, safe, and sound healthcare in our country, so we can be sure that patients are receiving the best treatments that do more help than harm,&#8221; said SAM President and former senior White House drug policy advisor Kevin Sabet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raw marijuana is not medicine, so marijuana in crude form should not be legal, but the medicinal components properly researched, purified, and dosed should be made available through compassionate research programs, as outlined in SAM&#8217;s six-point plan entitled &#8220;Researching Marijuana&#8217;s Medical Potential Responsibly.&#8221; We understand the FDA process can seem cumbersome to those suffering from intractable diseases, but early access programs to drugs in development are already available.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, while FDA approval is the long-term goal, seizure patients shouldn&#8217;t have to go to the unregulated market to get products full of contaminants. Responsible legislation that fast-tracks these medications for those truly in need should be supported, rather than diverting patients to an unregulated CBD market proven to be hawking contaminated or mislabeled products as medicine, as this bill would endorse. In 2015 and 2016 the FDA sent multiple warning letters to numerous CBD manufacturers, outlining these concerns. We support the development of FDA-approved CBD medications, like Epidolex, which is in the final stages of approval.&#8221;</p>

		<p>SPOKANE, Wash. &#8211; The release of more data on the effects of marijuana on a baby has led researchers to the conclusion that moms should think twice before using pot during and after pregnancy.</p>
<p>Many moms turn to marijuana for relief of symptoms such as nausea and anxiety, yet scientific research is emerging that identifies associated risks.</p>
<p>Confusion over the safety of these products prompted multiple agencies, including the Spokane Regional Health District, to launch a new component to its Weed to Know campaign: Weed to Know for Baby and You.</p>
<p>The campaign educates families and caregivers about harms associated with marijuana use while pregnant, breastfeeding, or caring for children. The campaign stresses the results of several peer-reviewed studies, which revealed: Marijuana use before pregnancy could:  -Cause a baby to be born before his or her body and brain are ready. This  could mean serious health problems at birth and throughout life.</p>
<p>-Change how a baby&#8217;s brain develops. These changes may cause life-long  behavior problems like trouble paying attention or following rules.  for them to do well in school. Marijuana use during breastfeeding is associated with these risks:  -Feeding problems, as THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, can lower milk  supply.</p>
<p>-Increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome</p>
<p>Using marijuana can affect a person&#8217;s ability to safely care for a baby or other children. Marijuana use decreases a person&#8217;s ability to concentrate, impairs judgment, and slows response time.</p>
<p>“We hear all the time from mothers who feel they used marijuana ‘successfully’ in previous pregnancies, or know someone who did, but it is also likely the child is not old enough yet to exhibit the long-term health consequences,” said Melissa Charbonneau, a public health nurse in the health district’s Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs program. “To be on the safe side, your best bet is to avoid marijuana altogether while you&#8217;re expecting.”</p>

		<p>Marijuana sales have created an economic boom in U.S. states that have fully or partially relaxed their cannabis laws, but is the increased cultivation and sale of this crop also creating escalating environmental damage and a threat to public health?</p>
<p>In an opinion piece published by the journal Environmental Science and Technology, researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Lancaster University in the U.K. have called on U.S. federal agencies to fund studies that will gather essential environmental data from the legal cultivation farms and facilities.</p>
<p>This information could then be used to help U.S. states minimize any environmental and public health damage caused by this burgeoning industry and aid legal marijuana growers in making their business environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p>State-by-state legalization is effectively creating a new industry in U.S., one that looks set to rival all but the largest of current businesses. In Colorado alone, sales revenues have reached $1 billion, roughly equal to that from grain farming in the state. By 2020 it is estimated that country-wide legal marijuana sales will generate more annual revenue than the National Football League.</p>
<p>But the article, titled &#8220;High Time to Assess the Environmental Impacts of Cannabis Cultivation&#8221; co-authored by William Vizuete, associate professor of environment sciences and engineering at UNC&#8217;s Gillings School of Global Public health and Kirsti Ashworth, research fellow at Lancaster University&#8217;s Lancaster Environment Centre say that this expanded cultivation carries with it serious environmental effects.</p>
<p>Their article points out that cannabis is an especially needy crop requiring high temperatures (25-30 °C for indoor operations), strong light, highly fertile soil and large volumes of water &#8212; around twice that of wine grapes. In addition, the authors state that the few available studies of marijuana cultivation have uncovered potentially significant environmental impacts due to excessive water and energy demands and local contamination of water, air, and soil.</p>
<p>For example, a study of illegal outdoor grow operations in northern California found that rates of water extraction from streams threatened aquatic ecosystems. High levels of growth nutrients, as well as pesticides, herbicides and fungicides, also found their way back into the local environment, further damaging aquatic wildlife.</p>
<p>Controlling the indoor growing environment requires considerable energy with power requirements estimated to be similar to that of Google&#8217;s massive data centers. No significant data has been collected on the air pollution impacts on worker&#8217;s public health inside these growing facilities or the degradation of outdoor air quality due to emissions produced by the industrial scale production of marijuana.</p>
<p>The authors emphasize, however, much of the data on marijuana cultivation to date has come from monitoring illegal cannabis growing operations.</p>
<p>Dr Ashworth of Lancaster Environment Centre said: &#8220;The illegal status of marijuana has prevented us from understanding the detrimental impacts that this industrial scale operation has on the environment and public health.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an industry undergoing a historic transition, presenting an historic opportunity to be identified as a progressive, world-leading example of good practice and environmental stewardship.&#8221;</p>
<p>The continued expansion of legalization by the states does offer significant opportunities for the US Department of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National</p>
<p>Institutes of Health (NIH, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to fund research into legal cannabis cultivation to protect the environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Generating accurate data in all the areas we discussed offers significant potential to reduce energy consumption and environmental harm, protect public health and ultimately, improve cultivation methods,&#8221; said Dr Vizuete . &#8220;There are also significant potential public health issues caused by emissions from the plants themselves rather than smoking it. These emissions cause both indoor and outdoor air pollution.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Illicit cannabis use and cannabis use disorders increased at a greater rate in states that passed medical marijuana laws than in other states, according to new research at Columbia University&#8217;s Mailman School of Public Health and Columbia University Medical Center. The findings will be published online in JAMA Psychiatry.</p>
<p>Laws and attitudes regarding cannabis have changed over the last 20 years. In 1991, no Americans lived in states with medical marijuana laws, while in 2012, more than one-third lived in states with medical marijuana laws, and fewer view cannabis use as entailing any risks.</p>
<p>The new study is among the first to analyze the differences in cannabis use and cannabis use disorders before and after states passed medical marijuana laws, as well as differentiate between earlier and more recent periods and additionally examine selected states separately.</p>
<p>The researchers used data from three national surveys collected from 118,497 adults: the 1991-1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey, the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions and the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III.</p>
<p>Overall, between 1991-1992 and 2012-2013, illicit cannabis use increased significantly more in states that passed medical marijuana laws than in other states, as did cannabis use disorders. In particular, between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013, increases in use ranged from 3.5 percentage points in states with no medical marijuana laws to 7.0 percentage points in Colorado. Rates of increase in the prevalence of cannabis use disorder followed similar patterns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Medical marijuana laws may benefit some with medical problems. However, changing state laws &#8212; medical or recreational &#8212; may also have adverse public health consequences, including cannabis use disorders,&#8221; said author Deborah Hasin, PhD, associate professor of Epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health and in the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center. &#8220;A prudent interpretation of our results is that professionals and the public should be educated on risks of cannabis use and benefits of treatment, and prevention/intervention services for cannabis disorders should be provided.&#8221;</p>
<p>While illicit use of marijuana decreased and marijuana use disorder changed little between 1991-1992 and 2001-2002, both use and disorder rates increased between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013. In 1991-1992, predicted prevalence of use and disorder were higher in California than other states with early-medical marijuana laws (use: 7.6 percent vs. 4.5 percent; disorder: 2 percent vs. 1.15 percent). However, the predicted prevalence of past year use in California did not differ significantly from states that passed laws more recently. In contrast, the prevalence of use and disorder increased in the other 5 states with early medical marijuana laws.</p>
<p>&#8220;Future studies are needed to investigate mechanisms by which increased cannabis use is associated with medical marijuana laws, including increased perceived safety, availability, and generally permissive attitudes,&#8221; Dr. Hasin also noted.</p>

		<p>One in 5 adolescents at risk of tobacco dependency, harmful alcohol consumption and illicit drug use</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Bristol have found regular and occasional cannabis use as a teen is associated with a greater risk of other illicit drug taking in early adulthood.   The study by Bristol&#8217;s Population Health Science Institute, published online in the Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health, also found cannabis use was associated with harmful drinking and smoking.</p>
<p>Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), the researchers looked at levels of cannabis use during adolescence to determine whether these might predict other problematic substance misuse in early adulthood &#8212; by the age of 21.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at data about cannabis use among 5,315 teens between the ages of 13 and 18. At five time points approximately one year apart cannabis use was categorised as none; occasional (typically less than once a week); or frequent (typically once a week or more).</p>
<p>When the teens reached the age of 21, they were asked to say whether and how much they smoked and drank, and whether they had taken other illicit drugs during the previous three months. Some 462 reported recent illicit drug use: 176 (38%) had used cocaine; 278 (60%) had used &#8216;speed&#8217; (amphetamines); 136 (30%) had used inhalants; 72 (16%) had used sedatives; 105 (23%) had used hallucinogens; and 25 (6%) had used opioids.</p>
<p>The study&#8217;s lead author, Dr Michelle Taylor from the School of Social and Community Medicine said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We tend to see clusters of different forms of substance misuse in adolescents and young people, and it has been argued that cannabis acts as a gateway to other drug use. However, historically the evidence has been inconsistent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the most important findings from this study are that one in five adolescents follow a pattern of occasional or regular cannabis use and that those individuals are more likely to be tobacco dependant, have harmful levels of alcohol consumption or use other illicit drugs in early adulthood.&#8221;</p>
<p>In all, complete data were available for 1571 people. Male sex, mother&#8217;s substance misuse and the child&#8217;s smoking, drinking, and behavioural problems before the age of 13 were all strongly associated with cannabis use during adolescence. Other potentially influential factors were also considered: housing tenure; mum&#8217;s education and number of children she had; her drinking and drug use; behavioural problems when the child was 11 and whether s/he had started smoking and/or drinking before the age of 13.</p>
<p>After taking account of other influential factors, those who used cannabis in their teens were at greater risk of problematic substance misuse by the age of 21 than those who didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Teens who regularly used cannabis were 37 times more likely to be nicotine dependent and three times more likely to have a harmful drinking pattern than non-users by the time they were 21. And they were 26 times more likely to use other illicit drugs.</p>
<p>Both those who used cannabis occasionally early in adolescence and those who starting using it much later during the teenage years had a heightened risk of nicotine dependence, harmful drinking, and other illicit drug use. And the more cannabis they used the greater was the likelihood of nicotine dependence by the age of 21.</p>
<p>This study used observational methods and therefore presents evidence for correlation but not does not determine clear cause and effect &#8212; whether the results observed are because cannabis use actually causes the use of other illicit drugs. Furthermore, it does not identify what the underlying mechanisms for this might be. Nevertheless, clear categories of use emerged.</p>
<p>Dr Taylor concludes:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have added further evidence that suggests adolescent cannabis use does predict later problematic substance use in early adulthood. From our study, we cannot say why this might be, and it is important that future research focuses on this question, as this will enable us to identify groups of individuals that might as risk and develop policy to advise people of the harms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our study does not support or refute arguments for altering the legal status of cannabis use &#8212; especially since two of the outcomes are legal in the UK. This study and others do, however, lend support to public health strategies and interventions that aim to reduce cannabis exposure in young people.&#8221;</p>

<p>· •Cannabidiol appears often in Norwegian THC-positive blood samples.</p>
<p>· •Cannabidiol does not appear to protect against THC-induced impairment.</p>
<p>· •Cannabidiol may be detected in blood for more than 2 h after cannabis intake.</p>
<p>· •Hashish has revealed far lower THC/cannabidiol ratios than marijuana in Norway.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background and aims</strong></p>
<p>Several publications have suggested increasing cannabis potency over the last decade, which, together with lower amounts of cannabidiol (CBD), could contribute to an increase in adverse effects after cannabis smoking. Naturalistic studies on tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD in blood samples are, however, missing. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between THC- and CBD concentrations in blood samples among cannabis users, and to compare cannabinoid concentrations with the outcome of a clinical test of impairment (CTI) and between traffic accidents and non-accident driving under the influence of drugs (DUID)-cases. Assessment of THC- and CBD contents in cannabis seizures was also included.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>THC- and CBD concentrations in blood samples from subjects apprehended in Norway from April 2013–April 2015 were included (n = 6134). A CTI result was compared with analytical findings in cases where only THC and/or CBD were detected (n = 705). THC- and CBD content was measured in 41 cannabis seizures.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>Among THC-positive blood samples, 76% also tested positive for CBD. There was a strong correlation between THC- and CBD concentrations in blood samples (Pearson’s r = 0.714, p &lt; 0.0005). Subjects judged as impaired by a CTI had significantly higher THC- (p &lt; 0.001) and CBD (p = 0.008) concentrations compared with not impaired subjects, but after multivariate analyses, impairment could only be related to THC concentration (p = 0.004). Analyzing seizures revealed THC/CBD ratios of 2:1 for hashish and 200:1 for marijuana.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>More than ¾ of the blood samples testing positive for THC, among subjects apprehended in Norway, also tested positive for CBD, suggesting frequent consumption of high CBD cannabis products. The simultaneous presence of CBD in blood does, however, not appear to affect THC-induced impairment on a CTI. Seizure sample analysis did not reveal high potency cannabis products, and while CBD content appeared high in hashish, it was almost absent in marijuana.</p>

		<p>Warfarin. A single published case report describes an interaction with a patient taking warfarin who also regularly smoked tobacco and marijuana. The patient had multiple comorbidities and was taking at least 10 other medications. On at least two occasions, the patient&#8217;s international normalized ratio (INR) increased to values over 10 with episodes of bleeding. The only change reported for both occasions was an increase in the amount and frequency of marijuana smoking.[24] Patients who take warfarin and use marijuana regularly should receive close INR monitoring for any potential interaction.</p>
<p>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). A recent study examined baseline serum AED levels to identify drug-drug interactions between CBD and 19 AEDs during an open-label safety study in 81 patients (39 adults, 42 children) with refractory epilepsy.[25] As doses of CBD were increased, the researchers noted an increase in the serum levels of topiramate (P&lt;.01), rufinamide (P&lt;.01), and desmethylclobazam (P&lt;.01) and a decrease in the levels of clobazam (P&lt;.01) in both adult and pediatric patients. In adult patients, a significant increase in the serum levels of zonisamide (P=.02) and eslicarbazepine (P=.04) was observed with increasing CBD dose. No other drug interactions among the 19 AEDs were noted.   The authors recommended monitoring serum AED levels in patients receiving CBD, as drug-drug interactions may be correlated with adverse events and laboratory abnormalities.</p>
<p>Patients using marijuana should be educated to avoid drugs that affect associated CYP450 enzymes. When these drugs cannot be avoided, and marijuana use is expected to continue, the patient should be monitored closely for potential drug interactions.   Be Aware and Educate Patients</p>
<p>Smoking more than two joints weekly is likely to increase the risk for drug-related interactions.[5,10] No data exist monitoring large-scale marijuana use in the United States. However, in Washington, a state in which marijuana use is legal, the average user is estimated to smoke two to three joints per week.[26]  With growing legalization and use throughout the nation, healthcare professionals must exercise heightened caution in the situation of concomitant use of medications and marijuana.</p>

		<p>Study Finds Users Are 26 Times More Likely To Turn To Other Substances By The Age Of 21</p>
<p>Study is first clear evidence that cannabis is gateway to cocaine and heroin</p>
<p>Teen marijuana smokers are 37 times more likely to be hooked on nicotine</p>
<p>Findings from Bristol University provide authoritative support for those warning against the liberalisation of drugs laws</p>
<p>Teenagers who regularly smoke cannabis are 26 times more likely to turn to other drugs by the age of 21.</p>
<p>The study of the lives of more than 5,000 teenagers produced the first resounding evidence that cannabis is a gateway to cocaine, amphetamines, hallucinogens and heroin.</p>
<p>It also discovered that teenage cannabis smokers are 37 times more likely to be hooked on nicotine and three times more likely to be problem drinkers than non-users of the drug.</p>
<p>The findings from Bristol University provide authoritative support for those warning against the liberalisation of drugs laws.</p>
<p>Medical researchers have argued for years that cannabis is far from harmless and instead carries serious mental health risks.</p>
<p>Dr Michelle Taylor, who led the study, said: ‘It has been argued that cannabis acts as a gateway to other drug use. However, historically the evidence has been inconsistent.</p>
<p>‘The most important findings from this study are that one in five adolescents follow a pattern of occasional or regular cannabis use and that those individuals are more likely to be tobacco dependent, have harmful levels of alcohol consumption or use other illicit drugs in early adulthood.</p>

<p>The survey, which was published in the Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health, examined 5,315 teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18. One in five used cannabis.</p>
<p>Dr Tom Freeman of King’s College London said: ‘This is a high quality study using a large UK cohort followed from birth. It provides further evidence that early exposure to cannabis is associated with subsequent use of other drugs.’</p>
<p>The study of the lives of more than 5,000 teenagers produced the first resounding evidence that cannabis is a gateway to cocaine amphetamines, hallucinogens and heroin .</p>
<p>Ian Hamilton, who is a mental health researcher at York University, said: ‘It adds to evidence that cannabis acts as a gateway to nicotine dependence, as the majority of people using cannabis in the UK combine tobacco with cannabis when they roll a joint.</p>
<p>‘This habit represents one of the greatest health risks to the greatest number of young people who use cannabis.  It suggests that adolescent cannabis use serves as a gateway to a harmful relationship with drugs as an adult.’</p>
<p>The report said: ‘After taking account of other influential factors, those who used cannabis in their teens were at greater risk of problematic substance misuse by the age of 21.</p>
<p>‘Teens who regularly used cannabis were 37 times more likely to be nicotine dependent and three times more likely to have a harmful drinking pattern than non-users by the time they were 21. And they were 26 times more likely to use other illicit drugs.</p>

		<p>Changes may increase risk of continued drug use and addiction</p>
<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Most people would get a little ‘rush’ out of the idea that they’re about to win some money. In fact, if you could look into their brain at that very moment, you’d see lots of activity in the part of the brain that responds to rewards.</p>
<p>But for people who’ve been using marijuana, that rush just isn’t as big – and gets smaller over time, a new study finds.</p>
<p>And that dampened, blunted response may actually open marijuana users up to more risk of becoming addicted to that drug or others.</p>
<p>The new results come from the first long-term study of young marijuana users that tracked brain responses to rewards over time. It was performed at the University of Michigan Medical School.</p>
<p>Published in JAMA Psychiatry, it shows measurable changes in the brain’s reward system with marijuana use – even when other factors like alcohol use and cigarette smoking were taken into account.</p>
<p>“What we saw was that over time, marijuana use was associated with a lower response to a monetary reward,” says senior author and U-M neuroscientist Mary Heitzeg, Ph.D. “This means that something that would be rewarding to most people was no longer rewarding to them, suggesting but not proving that their reward system has been ‘hijacked’ by the drug, and that they need the drug to feel reward &#8212; or that their emotional response has been dampened.”</p>
<p><strong>Watching the reward centers</strong></p>
<p>The study involved 108 people in their early 20s – the prime age for marijuana use. All were taking part in a larger study of substance use, and all had brain scans at three points over four years. Three-quarters were men, and nearly all were white.</p>
<p>While their brain was being scanned in a functional MRI scanner, they played a game that asked them to click a button when they saw a target on a screen in front of them. Before each round, they were told they might win 20 cents, or $5 – or that they might lose that amount, have no reward or loss.</p>
<p>The researchers were most interested at what happened in the reward centers of the volunteers’ brains – the area called the nucleus accumbens. And the moment they cared most about was that moment of anticipation, when the volunteers knew they might win some money, and were anticipating performing the simple task that it would take to win.</p>
<p>In that moment of anticipating a reward, the cells of the nucleus accumbens usually swing into action, pumping out a ‘pleasure chemical’ called dopamine. The bigger the response, the more pleasure or thrill a person feels – and the more likely they’ll be to repeat the behavior later.</p>
<p>But the more marijuana use a volunteer reported, the smaller the response in their nucleus accumbens over time, the researchers found.</p>
<p>While the researchers didn’t also look at the volunteers’ responses to marijuana-related cues, other research has shown that the brains of people who use a high-inducing drug repeatedly often respond more strongly when they’re shown cues related to that drug.</p>
<p>The increased response means the drug has become associated in their brains with positive, rewarding feelings. And that can make it harder to stop seeking out the drug and using it.</p>
<p>If this is true with marijuana users, says first author Meghan Martz, doctoral student in developmental psychology at U-M, “It may be that the brain can drive marijuana use, and that the use of marijuana can also affect the brain. We’re still unable to disentangle the cause and effect in the brain’s reward system, but studies like this can help that understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Change over time</strong></p>
<p>Regardless, the new findings show that there is change in the reward system over time with marijuana use. Heitzeg and her colleagues also showed recently in a paper in Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience that marijuana use impacts emotional functioning.</p>
<p>The new data on response to potentially winning money may also be further evidence that long-term marijuana use dampens a person’s emotional response – something scientists call anhedonia.</p>
<p>“We are all born with an innate drive to engage in behaviors that feel rewarding and give us pleasure,” says co-author Elisa Trucco, Ph.D., psychologist at the Center for Children and Families at Florida International University. “We now have convincing evidence that regular marijuana use impacts the brain’s natural response to these rewards. In the long run, this is likely to put these individuals at risk for addiction.”</p>
<p>Marijuana’s reputation as a “safe” drug, and one that an increasing number of states are legalizing for small-scale recreational use, means that many young people are trying it – as many as a third of college-age people report using it in the past year.</p>
<p>But Heitzeg says that her team’s findings, and work by other addiction researchers, has shown that it can cause effects including problems with emotional functioning, academic problems, and even structural brain changes. And, the earlier in life someone tries marijuana, the faster their transition to becoming dependent on the drug, or other substances.</p>
<p>“Some people may believe that marijuana is not addictive or that it’s ‘better’ than other drugs that can cause dependence,” says Heitzeg, who is an assistant professor of psychiatry at the U-M Medical School and member of the U-M Addiction Research Center. “But this study provides evidence that it’s affecting the brain in a way that may make it more difficult to stop using it. It changes your brain in a way that may change your behavior, and where you get your sense of reward from.”</p>
<p>She is among the neuroscientists and psychologists leading a nationwide study called ABCD, for Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development. That study will track thousands of today’s pre-teens nationwide over 10 years, looking at many aspects of their health and functioning, including brain development via brain scans. Since some of the teens in the study are likely to use marijuana, the study will provide a better chance of seeing what happens over time.</p>

		<p>A Colorado children’s hospital reports visits by teens to its emergency department and satellite urgent care centers more than quadrupled after the state legalized marijuana, a new study finds.</p>
<p>Researchers examined the hospital’s records for 13- to 21-year-olds between 2005 and 2015.</p>
<p>Colorado legalized medical marijuana in 2010 and recreational marijuana in 2014.</p>
<p>The annual number of visits related to marijuana or involving a positive marijuana urine drug screen more than quadrupled, from 146 in 2005 to 639 in 2014, the researchers found.</p>
<p>They will present their research at the 2017 Paediatric Academic Societies Meeting in San Francisco.</p>
<p>“The state-level effect of marijuana legalization on adolescent use has only begun to be evaluated,” lead author George Sam Wang, MD said in a news release. “As our results suggest, targeted marijuana education and prevention strategies are necessary to reduce the significant public health impact of the drug can have on adolescent populations, particularly on mental health.”</p>

		<p>A new study suggests smoking high-potency marijuana may cause damage to nerve fibers responsible for communication between the brain’s two hemispheres.</p>
<p>The study included MRI scans of 99 people, including some who were diagnosed with psychosis, HealthDay reports.  The researchers found an association between frequent use of high-potency marijuana and damage to the corpus callosum, which is responsible for communication between the brain’s left and right hemispheres.</p>
<p>The corpus callosum is especially rich in cannabinoid receptors. THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, acts on these receptors.</p>
<p>Today’s high-potency marijuana has been shown to contain higher proportions of THC compared with a decade ago. Scientists have known that the use of marijuana with higher THC content has been associated with greater risk and earlier onset of psychosis, the researchers noted. This study is the first to examine the effect of marijuana potency on brain structure, according to a news release from Kings’s College London.</p>
<p>Frequent use of high-potency marijuana significantly affected the structure of the corpus callosum in patients with or without psychosis, the researchers report in Psychological Medicine.    The more high-potency marijuana a person smoked, the greater the damage.</p>
<p>“There is an urgent need to educate health professionals, the public and policymakers about the risks involved with cannabis use,” said senior researcher Dr. Paola Dazzan of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience at King’s College London. “As we have suggested previously, when assessing cannabis use it is extremely important to gather information on how often and what type of cannabis is being used.</p>
<p>These details can help quantify the risk of mental health problems and increase awareness on the type of damage these substances can do to the brain.’</p>

		<p>Researchers at Canada’s Waterloo University studied what happens to academic goals, engagement, preparedness, and performance when high school students shift from no marijuana use to marijuana use. Their sample included 26,475 students in grades 9-12 in the COMPASS study, Canada’s largest survey of youth substance use. The researchers found that compared to students who do not use marijuana, those who use it at least once a month were:</p>
<p>· four times more likely to skip class,</p>
<p>· two to four times less likely to complete homework,</p>
<p>· two to four times less likely to value getting good grades, and</p>
<p>· half as likely to actually get good grades.</p>
<p>Moreover, half of those who smoked marijuana daily were less likely to report plans to attend college compared to nonusers. “We found that the more frequently students started using the drug, the greater their risk for poor school performance and engagement,” says Karen Patte, lead author of the study.

		<p>Prescribing medicinal cannabis for patients with chronic non-cancer pain is not going to revolutionise their treatment and should not be supported until there is substantial proof of its effectiveness, according to a leading pain specialist.</p>
<p>Professor Milton Cohen is presenting Medicinal cannabis for chronic non-cancer pain: promise or pothole? at the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) annual scientific meeting in Brisbane on Saturday May 13. “There is no reason to be enthusiastic about cannabinoids in the treatment of non-cancer related chronic pain,’’ Professor Cohen said.</p>
<p>‘‘On the basis of what we know about cannabis as a treatment it’s not going to revolutionise the field of chronic pain management.’’</p>
<p>Professor Cohen is a specialist pain medicine physician in Sydney and Director of Professional Affairs for ANZCA’s Faculty of Pain Medicine. The Faculty does not support the use of cannabinoids in chronic non-cancer pain ‘’until such time as a clear therapeutic role for them is identified in the scientific literature.’’</p>
<p>Professor Cohen said he was concerned that ‘’anecdote and clamour’’ and ‘’community enthusiasm’’ had preceded science on the issue of prescribing medicinal cannabis for patients who suffered chronic non-cancer pain. As a result, a culture of ‘’false hope’’ based on the elusive idea of a ‘’magic pill’’ was driving community misinformation about medicinal cannabis as a treatment for such patients.</p>
<p>The Federal government last year legalised a pathway for access of patients to Australian-grown and manufactured medicinal cannabis, subject to state and territory government regulations. In New Zealand, the use of cannabis-based products for medicinal purposes is available only on prescription authorised by the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>‘’It’s a classic example of the cart being put before the horse with a political imperative to facilitate access to an unproven medicine,’’ Professor Cohen said. International studies that have assessed the effectiveness of medicinal cannabis for non-cancer chronic pain have revealed very ‘’modest’’ effects, he said.</p>
<p>‘’The international data on which one could make an informed decision about the effect of medicinal cannabis on chronic non-cancer pain is in fact very poor. The conclusions have been oversold,’’ he said.</p>
<p>Professor Cohen said the management of chronic non-cancer pain is complex as it required consideration of a range of factors including the medical, physical, psychological and social.</p>
<p>‘’We know that chronic pain is a much more complex phenomenon which requires a holistic approach to management that is tailored to the individual&#8217;s circumstances. To rely only on medicines is just not going to work.</p>
<p>‘’If doctors are to prescribe substances—that is if they are to be available on doctors’ prescriptions—they should be proven substances,’’ Professor Cohen explained.</p>
<p>Professor Cohen cited an ongoing study of 1500 people who had been prescribed opioids for chronic non-cancer pain, undertaken by the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. Almost half of those surveyed said they had used cannabis for recreational purposes, one in six admitted to using cannabis in search of pain relief and one quarter said they would use cannabis in search of pain relief if they could.</p>
<p>‘’We know that cannabis is freely available but we also know that drugs are not the mainstay of managing chronic pain,’’ Professor Cohen said.</p>
<p>Professor Cohen said that, given the legislative changes introduced by the Federal government and some states and territories, the introduction of individualised trials of medicinal cannabis for patients with chronic non-cancer pain to monitor and evaluate its effectiveness and adverse effects might be considered. This would require the development of a patient register, similar to an approach introduced in Israel, to ensure that the trial was properly monitored and managed.</p>
<p>‘’Given the reality of the situation – these substances are going to be produced in Australia and will be marketed &#8212; so there now is an opportunity for individual, personalised clinical studies to ascertain if there is a benefit from this treatment,’’ Professor Cohen said.</p>
<p><strong>About FPM </strong></p>
<p>The Faculty of Pain Medicine is a world-leading professional organisation for pain specialists that sets standards in pain medicine and is responsible for education and training in the discipline in Australia and New Zealand. Pain medicine is multidisciplinary, recognising that the management of severe pain requires the skills or more than one area of medicine. Chronic pain affects about one in five people in Australia and New Zealand. Specialists also manage acute pain (post-operative, post-trauma, acute episodes of pain in medical conditions) and cancer pain.</p>

		<p>During the 2015 election, the Liberals campaigned on a plan to greenlight marijuana for recreational use to keep it out of the hands of children and the profits out of the hands of criminals.</p>
<p>The party&#8217;s election platform said Canada&#8217;s current approach &#8212; criminalizing people for possession and use &#8212; traps too many Canadians in the justice system for minor offences.</p>
<p>Last month, the government spelled out its plans in legislation, setting sweeping policy changes in motion.  The new law proposes setting the national minimum age to legally buy cannabis at 18 years old. It will be up to the provinces should they want to restrict it further.</p>
<p>Is it true, as Wilson-Raybould and the Liberals suggest, that legalization will in fact keep cannabis out of the hands of kids?</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: The Canadian Press Baloney Meter is a dispassionate examination of political statements culminating in a ranking of accuracy on a scale of &#8220;no baloney&#8221; to &#8220;full of baloney&#8221; (complete methodology below)</p>
<p>This one earns a lot of baloney &#8212; the statement is mostly inaccurate but contains elements of truth. Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<p><strong>THE FACTS</strong></p>
<p>There is no doubt cannabis is in the hands of young people today.</p>
<p>In fact, Canada has one of the highest rates of teenage and early-age adulthood use of marijuana, says Dr. Mark Ware, the vice-chair of the federally-appointed task force on cannabis and a medicinal marijuana researcher at McGill University.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t anticipate that this is going to eliminate it; but the public health approach is to make it less easy for young adolescents, young kids, to access cannabis than it is at the moment,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bonnie Leadbeater, a psychology professor at the University of Victoria who specializes in adolescent behaviour, said as many as 60 per cent of 18-year-olds have used marijuana at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>The aim of a regulated, controlled system of legalized cannabis is to make it more difficult for kids to access pot, Ware said, noting the principle goal is to delay the onset of use.</p>
<p>So will a recreational market for adults coupled with a regulatory regime really keep pot out of the hands of kids?</p>
<p><strong>THE EXPERTS</strong></p>
<p>Public health experts &#8212; including proponents of legalization &#8212; say that probably won&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly know what they are planning to do to keep it out of the hands of young people and I think some elaboration of that might be helpful,&#8221; Leadbeater said. &#8220;It is unlikely that it will change &#8230; it has been very, very accessible to young people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Benedikt Fischer, a University of Toronto psychiatry professor and senior scientist with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, agrees the expectation that legalization will suddenly reduce or eliminate use among young people is counter-intuitive and unrealistic to a large extent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing we could hope for is that maybe because it is legal, all of a sudden it is so much more boring for young people that they&#8217;re not interested in it anymore,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Increasing penalties for people who facilitate access to kids will help discourage law-abiding Canadians from doing so, says Steven Hoffman, director of a global strategy lab at the University of Ottawa Centre for health law, policy and ethics.</p>
<p>&#8220;That being said, when there&#8217;s a drug, there&#8217;s no foolproof way of keeping it out of the hands of all children,&#8221; Hoffman said. &#8220;For sure, there will still be children who are still consuming cannabis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cannabis will not be legal for people of all ages under the legislation, he added, noting this means there may still be a market for criminal activity for cannabis in the form of selling it to children.</p>
<p>In Colorado, officials thought there would be an increase in use as a result of legalization, according to Dr. Larry Wolk, chief medical officer at the Department of Public Health and Environment, but he said there&#8217;s been no increase among either youth or adults.    Nor has there been a noticeable decrease.</p>
<p>&#8220;What it looks like is folks who may have been using illicitly before are using legally now and teens or youth that were using illicitly before, it&#8217;s still the same rate of illicit use,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>THE VERDICT</strong></p>
<p>Donald MacPherson, executive director of the Canadian Drug Policy Coalition, said the Liberal government could provide a more nuanced, realistic message about its plans to legalize marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;To suddenly go over to the rhetoric &#8230; that strict regulation is going to keep it out of the hands of young people doesn&#8217;t work,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a better chance of reducing the harm to young people through a &#8230; public health, regulatory approach. That&#8217;s ideally what they should be saying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Careful messaging around legalized marijuana &#8212; like the approach taken by the Netherlands &#8212; could make cannabis less of a tempting forbidden fruit for young people, said Mark Haden, an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we know is that prohibition maximizes the engagement of youth, so if we did it well and skillfully and ended prohibition with a wise approach and made cannabis boring, it would keep it out of the hands of kids,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t completely baloney, it just hasn&#8217;t gone far enough in terms of a rich, real discussion. It is just political soundbites.&#8221;</p>
<p>For this reason, Wilson-Raybould&#8217;s statement contains &#8220;a lot of baloney.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>METHODOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>The Baloney Meter is a project of The Canadian Press that examines the level of accuracy in statements made by politicians. Each claim is researched and assigned a rating based on the following scale:</p>
<p>· No baloney &#8211; the statement is completely accurate</p>
<p>· A little baloney &#8211; the statement is mostly accurate but more information is required</p>
<p>· Some baloney &#8211; the statement is partly accurate but important details are missing</p>
<p>· A lot of baloney &#8211; the statement is mostly inaccurate but contains elements of truth</p>
<p>· Full of baloney &#8211; the statement is completely inaccurate</p>

		<p>The first to die was the family&#8217;s pet duck, killed in an attempt to rid the house of evil.</p>
<p>By then, Raina Thaiday had already been on a cleaning frenzy for a week, scrubbing the ceilings of her Cairns home and tossing possessions out into the yard in a bid to &#8220;cleanse&#8221; the house.  But it was when she heard a dove&#8217;s call, which she interpreted as a sign from God, that she decided she must &#8220;kill her children in order to save them&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Mental Health Court of Queensland last month ruled, in a decision not made public until Thursday, that Raina Mersane Ina Thaiday was of unsound mind when she stabbed to death seven of her children and a niece in her home on December 19, 2014.</p>
<p>In 2009, Raina Thaiday was interviewed thanking paramedics for safely delivering her child in the back of an ambulance. Photo: Nine News</p>
<p>&#8220;To her way of thinking at the time, what she was doing was the best thing she could do for her children. She was trying to save them,&#8221; Justice Jean Dalton said, exempting the mother from trial and confining her to mental health treatment.</p>
<p>Along the way the court heard details of the 40-year-old&#8217;s descent into &#8220;schizophrenia at its very depths&#8221;, likely exacerbated by years of heavy cannabis use, and culminating in her being in a psychotic state when she killed eight children under the age of 15.</p>
<p>A week before the killing, her then-20-year-old son, Lewis Warria found Mrs Thaiday stressed and serious, spending large amounts of time lecturing him about God, the court heard.  She went on a mission to &#8220;cleanse&#8221; her house, which Justice Dalton noted went far beyond a &#8220;normal spring clean&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the furniture from the house was taken outside and put in the yard,&#8221; she said.&#8221;Inside the house was cleaned, in a most unusual way, including scrubbing the ceilings and the walls and a lot of Mrs Thaiday&#8217;s possessions were thrown away.  &#8220;And a lot of them were quite valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Things deteriorated still further the night of December 18. Her eldest daughter, niece and godchild had gone out shopping and did not return at 10pm as she had requested. Mrs Thaiday walked up and down the street, &#8220;preaching&#8221; to neighbours about their use of drugs and alcohol.  Agitated, she slept outside on a mattress dragged out in the cleaning.</p>
<p>Justice Dalton said with the benefit of hindsight, the things neighbours heard as Mrs Thaiday walked up and down the street, talking to herself or on the phone, were &#8220;clearly psychotic&#8221;.  &#8220;She was saying things like &#8216;I am the chosen one&#8217;,&#8221; the judge said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have the power to kill people and to curse people. You hurt my kids, I hurt them first. You stab my kids, I stab them first. If you kill them, I&#8217;ll kill them&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>At 11.40am on December 19, Mr Warria arrived home to find his mother slumped on the front verandah, covered in approximately 35 self-inflicted stab wounds that included a punctured lung. His siblings and cousin were dead inside.</p>
<p>Nearly two-and-a-half years later Mr Warria was in the courtroom inside Brisbane&#8217;s Queen Elizabeth II Courts of Law as a judge heard the opinions of six psychiatrists who had painstakingly analysed his mother&#8217;s mental state.</p>
<p>The court heard when police and paramedics arrived Mrs Thaiday immediately admitted she had killed the children inside. &#8220;Papa God&#8221; had been speaking to her, she told</p>
<p>psychiatrists, describing herself as the &#8220;anointed one&#8221; at risk from demons, who had to rid her Cairns home of an evil presence.</p>
<p>Psychiatrist Dr Angela Voita treated Mrs Thaiday from the day she came into The Park, one of Australia&#8217;s largest mental health facilities, on Christmas Eve 2014, five days after the mass killing.  She assessed her more than 50 times and, along with three other psychiatrists who gave evidence to the hearing, unanimously agreed she was mentally ill at the time of the offences.</p>
<p>After examining reams of evidence and interviews, Dr Voita said her patient was not capable of telling right from wrong or being able to control her actions at the time of the killings.  Assisting psychiatrist Dr Frank Varghese described the &#8220;unique&#8221; crime as &#8220;a horrendous case, the likes of which I have never seen before, and hopefully will never see (again).&#8221;   This is not ordinary schizophrenia,&#8221; he advised the judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is schizophrenia at its very depths and at its worst in terms of the terror for the patient as well as for the consequences for the individuals killed as a result of psychotic delusions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs Thaiday had no psychiatric history or previous contact with mental health services outside of counselling at a local indigenous health service.  Independent psychiatrist Dr Pamela van de Hoef said there was some evidence that in 2007 she was also very disturbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;She had cut all her own hair off and threatened to kill one of the children with an axe.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2011, she had ideas to drown herself and similar thoughts two weeks out from the 2014 killing, the psychiatrist said. The court heard cannabis was commonly linked to the onset of schizophrenia in those already vulnerable to the illness.</p>
<p>Ms Thaiday kicked a 10-20 cone a day habit in the months before the slaughter, leading psychiatrists to question whether her &#8220;psychosis&#8221; was a form of withdrawal, before mostly rejecting the notion.</p>
<p>Instead, Dr Jane Phillips and Dr Donald Grant agreed it was more likely the illness began to affect her while she was still using cannabis, causing to her to develop &#8220;religious delusions&#8221; that &#8220;forced her to live a clean life&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Altogether it amounts to a very convincing body of evidence that Mrs Thaiday was psychotic at the time of the killing,&#8221; Justice Dalton said.</p>
<p>She ruled Mrs Thaiday had the defence of unsoundness of mind available to her and issued a forensic order for ongoing mental health treatment.</p>

		<p>SAN FRANCISCO – Visits by teens to a Colorado children&#8217;s hospital emergency department and its satellite urgent care centers increased rapidly after legalization of marijuana for commercialized medical and recreational use, according to new research being presented at the 2017 Paediatric Academic Societies Meeting in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The study abstract, “Impact of Marijuana Legalization in Colorado on Adolescent Emergency Visits” on Monday, May 8 at the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Colorado legalized the commercialization of medical marijuana in 2010 and recreational marijuana use in 2014. For the study, researchers reviewed the hospital system’s emergency department and urgent care records for 13- to 21-year-olds seen between January 2005 and June 2015.</p>
<p>They found that the annual number of visits with a cannabis related diagnostic code or positive for marijuana from a urine drug screen more than quadrupled during the decade, from 146 in 2005 to 639 in 2014.</p>
<p>Adolescents with symptoms of mental illness accounted for a large proportion (66%) of the 3,443 marijuana-related visits during the study period, said lead author George Sam Wang, M.D., FAAP, with psychiatry consultations increasing from 65 to 442. More than half also had positive urine drug screen tests for other drugs. Ethanol, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, opiates and cocaine were the most commonly detected.</p>
<p>Dr. Wang, an assistant professor of paediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said national data on teen marijuana use suggest rates remained roughly the same (about 7%) in 2015 as they’d been for a decade prior, with many concluding no significant impact from legalization. Based on the findings of his study, however, he said he suspects these national surveys do not entirely reflect the effect legalization may be having on teen usage.</p>
<p>“The state-level effect of marijuana legalization on adolescent use has only begun to be evaluated,” he said. “As our results suggest, targeted marijuana education and prevention strategies are necessary to reduce the significant public health impact of the drug can have on adolescent populations, particularly on mental health.”</p>
<p>Dr. Wang will present the abstract, “Impact of Marijuana Legalization in Colorado on Adolescent Emergency Department (ED) Visits,” from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. Numbers in this news release reflect updated information provided by the researchers. The abstract is available at https://registration.pas-meeting.org/2017/reports/rptPAS17_abstract.asp?abstract_final_id=3160.11.</p>

		<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>Cannabis use (CU) has recently been legalized in several states for medicinal purposes and remains the most commonly used illicit drug. Cardiovascular effects of CU are not well established as studies thus far have been limited by size. We therefore utilized a large national database to examine the incidence of cardiovascular risk factors and events amongst patients with CU.</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>
<p>Patients aged 18-55 years with CU were identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2009-2010 database using the Ninth Revision of International Classification of Disease (ICD) code 304.3. Demographics, risk factors, and cardiovascular event rates were collected on these patients and compared to general population data.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<p>Incidence of heart failure (HF), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), coronary artery disease (CAD), sudden cardiac death, and hypertension (HTN) were significantly higher in patients with CU. After multivariate regression adjusting for age, gender, diabetes mellitus, HTN, CAD, tobacco use, and alcohol use, CU remained an independent predictor of both HF (OR=1.1 [1.03-1.18], p&lt;0.01) and CVA (OR=1.24 [1.14-1.34], p&lt;0.001).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>
<p>CU independently predicted the risks of HF and CVA in individuals 18-55 years old. With continued legalization of cannabis, potential cardiovascular effects and their underlying mechanisms need to be further investigated.</p>

John Redwood MP, Dr. Phillip Lee MP and Adam Afriyie MP.</p>
<p><strong> INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The evidence couldn’t be clearer. Cannabis is a hugely damaging drug that causes misery, particularly for our poorest citizens. Our aim should be its eradication and that can never be achieved through legalised capitulation. According to a report published last November by the Adam Smith Institute, our drug policy is: ‘An embarrassment.’ (Laven-Morris, 2016, para. 1) Commenting on the report, Steve Moore, Director of ‘Volteface’ concurred, insisting that: ‘The global movement towards legalisation, regulation and taxation of cannabis is now inexorable.’ (Laven-Morris, 2016, para. 16)</p>
<p>While this supposed ‘inexorability’ may have political and social elites jumping for joy, it’s yet another step toward greater suffering for those vulnerable individuals at risk of damage from the mind-altering drug, as well as for families and communities who are, and will increasingly, be forced to pick up the pieces. Within this paper, I will seek to address some of the primary points of contention and concern surrounding cannabis and counter the myths and assertions propounded by ideologues, corporate lobbyists, and the liberal media, each dogmatic in their pursuit of recreational cannabis legalisation. I will conclude that the consistent application of the meaningful criminal penalties already legislatively available, aggressive and rigorous policing across the socio-economic spectrum, the use of evidence based education, conferring the real health-risks of the drug and well-funded, compassionate, abstinence-based treatment for those who have become dependent on cannabis can, deliver its eradication.</p>
<p><strong> 1) HARM </strong></p>
<p>Forgive my scepticism, but when that all-knowing beacon of progress and morality, billionaire Richard Branson insisted that, ‘most of us’ could smoke skunk without it doing us ‘any harm,’ I was not immediately convinced. (Holehouse, 2015, para. 2) The problem is that most of the people that Mr Branson has ever met are wealthy, expensively educated elites, who likely have access to the private health insurance he’s so keen for ‘Virgin Healthcare’ to bestow on the rest of us. Even if Mr Branson was right and cannabis, for most, presented no tangible health risks, this would still not be sufficient moral rationale for its legalisation. If we care about all our fellow citizens we cannot sacrifice the mental health of some for the recreational pleasure of ‘most.’</p>
<p>Correspondingly, also in support of legalisation is Amanda Fielding, Countess of Wemyss and March and founder of the pro-drug Beckley Foundation &#8211; located at Fielding’s Oxfordshire Tudor estate. The foundation boldly assert in their book: ‘Cannabis Policy: Moving beyond Stalemate,’ that with regards to cannabis: ‘Those harms at the population level are modest in comparison with alcohol or cocaine.’ (Beckley Foundation, 2009, para. 2) While there is no doubt that both alcohol and cocaine can create as much if not more misery than cannabis, its possible nature as a ‘slightly lesser’ evil is no cause for its celebration. Long gone are the 3 days in which advocates could claim that the effects of cannabis were ‘modest.’ This well perpetuated myth of ‘harmlessness’ has now been comprehensively medically discredited.</p>
<p>There is an increasingly diverse research consensus that cannabis use is directly connected to serious mental health issues. Timms and Atakin (2014) revealed that Adolescents who use cannabis daily are ‘five times more likely to develop depression and anxiety later in life,’ (para. 36) while Hall &amp; Degenhardt’s (2011) strong body of evidence indicates that: ‘cannabis precipitates schizophrenia in vulnerable people.’ (p. 511) Further, Hall &amp; Degenhardt discovered that, for those with a family history of psychosis, regular cannabis use doubles the likelihood of development from one in ten, to one in five. (2011, p. 512)</p>
<p>When we look at expectant mothers who smoke cannabis we see a direct correlation. The more they smoke, the greater the likelihood that their children will report feelings of depression and anxiety at the age of ten. (Goldschmidta, Richardson, Cornelius &amp; Dayb, 2004, p. 526) Moreover, a huge American study, utilising the latest technology in brain-scanning equipment discovered that cannabis users had: ‘abnormally low blood flow in virtually every area of the brain.’ This means that users are at considerably higher risk of developing diseases such as Alzheimer’s. (Tatera, 2016, para. 1)   Even Professor Nutt, a well-known proponent of legalisation, concedes that cannabis smokers are ‘2.6 times more likely to have a psychotic-like experience than non-smokers.’ (Nutt, 2009, para. 7).</p>
<p>In addition to the real danger cannabis poses to mental health, research suggests that the use of cannabis doubles the risk of infertility in men under the age of 30. (Connor, 2014, para. 1) The mind is complicated beyond the possibility of human comprehension. A cautious and respectful approach to its potential damage is surely wise, as once it is lost it must be an exceedingly difficult thing to get back. There are few more disturbing things than seeing a friend or relative struggle with mental health issues – a daily battle not with the world but with themselves. Indeed, youngsters who use cannabis daily are seven times more likely to commit suicide. (Laccino, 2014, para. 1) So, while Mr Branson might encourage you to smoke cannabis with your children, (Janssen, 2016, para 4) the evidence would suggest that doing so could be very damaging indeed.</p>
<p><strong> 2) USAGE RATES AND CANNABIS AS A GATEWAY DRUG </strong></p>
<p>Those who back legalisation might argue that it is they who truly care about cannabis users and they who truly want to reduce the drug’s harmful impacts. This, they insist, will be made possible by the reduction in usage rates that a legalised market will deliver. Indeed, the entire foundation of the argument for legalisation rests on its ability to decrease the numbers of people using cannabis. The facts and evidence stand comprehensibly against this assertion. Every single location in which there has been meaningful analysis of usage rates before and after legalisation or decriminalisation, including Portugal, Colorado, Southern Australia and Amsterdam, show an upsurge in the number of people using the drug. (Hughes and Steven, 2010, p. 1005), (Korf, 2002 pp. 854-856), (Single, Christie &amp; Ali para. 25), (Keyes, 2015) Even within individual nations, the difference between usage rates in jurisdictions with varying legislative approaches is stark. 15.6% of citizens in the Netherlands have used cannabis compared to 36.7% of residents in Amsterdam. (Korf, 2002, p. 854-856) In fact, following the mainstream promotion of coffee-shops in Amsterdam, the rate of regular cannabis use among 18-to-20-year-olds more than doubled. (MacCoun and Reuter, 2010 as cited in Mineta, n.d para. 8) Furthermore, legal cannabis would mean cheaper cannabis. Prohibition drives up the price of the drug by ‘at least’ 400%. (Mineta, n.d, para. 7) Studies have shown that when cigarettes are reduced in price by 10% their consumption shoots up by 7-8%.(Mineta, n.d, para. 7)</p>
<p>While its proponents might have you believe ‘everyone’s getting high nowadays,’ it’s worth remembering that only 5% of our population regularly smoke cannabis. (Dunt 2013 para. 1) This compared to 19% who smoke tobacco (Ash, 2016, para. 1) and 58% of adults who regularly drink alcohol. (Drinkaware, n.d, para. 10) For some advocates of legalisation who, either genuinely believe or pretend to believe that legalisation will lead usage rates to decline, this evidence will, of course, be somewhat inconvenient.</p>
<p>For others, it brings only adulation. In the US state of Colorado, the CEO of the Harvest Company dispensary, rejoiced that: ‘People who would never have considered pot before are now popping their heads in.’ (Keyes, 2015, para. 7) Likewise, when asked why he believed cannabis use had increased in the state since its legalisation, Henson, President of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce, argued that more people felt at ease with the drug: ‘They don’t see it as something that’s bad for them.’ (Keyes, 2015, para. 6) What’s more, with regards to the gateway theory, the evidence is clear. Cannabis is a gateway drug. A 25-year longitude study revealed that in 86% of cases of those who had taken two or more illegal drugs, cannabis had been the substance they had used first. (Fergusson. D, Boden. J &amp; Horwood. J 2011, p. 556)</p>
<p>Moreover, those who used cannabis weekly were a staggering 59 times more likely to use other illegal drugs than those who did not use cannabis at all. (Fergusson, D. &amp; Horwood J. 2000, pp. 505–520) In the United States, research revealed that only 7% of young people who had never used cannabis had indulged in other illegal drug use, compare this to 33% of the young people who reported using cannabis regularly and 84% of those who used it daily. (Kandel, 1984, pp. 200 – 209)</p>
<p>Advocates of legalisation, while often conceding the gateway theory, insist that this can easily be countered through legalisation that would disentangle legal cannabis from the illegal ‘hard drug’ black market. However, cannabis users are not using other drugs because their dealers are forcing them down their throats or up their noses. Rather: ‘the biochemical changes induced by marijuana in the brain result in a drug-seeking, drug-taking behaviour, which in many instances will lead the user to experiment with other pleasurable substances.’ (Nahas, 1990, p. 52) Thus, cannabis users will likely seek to experiment with other illegal drugs regardless of the legal status of cannabis. Legalisation would result only in more cannabis users and thus a higher secondary demand for and entanglement within the remaining illegal drug market.</p>
<p><strong> 3) MONEY: A PRICE WORTH PAYING?</strong></p>
<p>The Adam Smith Institute have promised the UK one billion pounds in additional annual tax revenue. All we must do is legalise the drug. However, we can see by examining the cost of alcohol</p>
<p>abuse that any additional tax revenue would be dwarfed by the hugely increased medical and social costs brought about by increased usage. The taxes raised from alcohol cover only a tiny percentage of the societal cost brought about by alcohol misuse. Indeed, while there are no similar statistics available in the UK, a 2002 analysis of alcohol-related costs in America was estimated to be 184 billion dollars annually. (Mineta, n.d. para 10) But surely the billions of dollars raised in taxes more than covered it? Not quite! Taxes on alcohol raised only 8.3 billon dollars in the same timeframe, just 4.5% of costs. (Mineta, n.d. para 10)</p>
<p>In addition, we can be sure that where there is profit to be made, there will be also be predatory capitalism. The aggressive commercialisation of cannabis has already begun, with ‘big tobacco’ companies investing considerable funding in their next project for the betterment of humanity. Similarly, Microsoft have unashamedly announced their partnership with ‘Kind financial,’ a business that ‘logistically supports’ cannabis growers. (Becker, 2016, para. 1) By definition, the purpose of dope companies within legal markets is to sell as much cannabis to as many people as possible and crucial to this pursuit is persuading new users to try their product. In the US there is growing concern these companies have already begun to target a young, impressionable audience with their advertisement.</p>
<p>Likewise, disingenuous associations between cannabis and wellness and barefaced lies regarding the non-existent curative potential of the drug are becoming common-place. According to Vara, the aim is simple. Make as much money as possible by making: ‘Pot seem as all American as an ice-cold beer.’ (Vara, 2016, para. 1)</p>
<p><strong>4) SOCIAL MOBILITY and PUBLIC OPINION </strong></p>
<p>Inevitably, it is working class young people who are least able to afford the damage that cannabis wreaks on their focus, self-belief and motivation, as well as on their education and career opportunities. It’s well known that cannabis users have lower levels of dopamine in the striatum part of their brains, meaning lower levels of motivation and aspiration. (Bergland, 2013, para. 1) Even after a wide ranging and comprehensive allowance for confounding factors, a Christchurch study observing 1265 children found a strong link between educational underachievement and the use of cannabis. (Fergusson, Horwood &amp; Beautrais, 2003, p. 1682) Those who had used the drug one hundred times or more before the age of sixteen were three times more likely than those who had never used cannabis to leave education without any qualifications. (Fergusson, Horwood &amp; Beautrais, 2003, p. 1690)</p>
<p>In addition, the numbing effect the drug has on the brain of a user and its ability to concentrate and remember things can continue for days after usage. This means that, for regular users, they may never be able to operate at the best of their ability and fulfil their potential. (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2016, p. 1) Overall then, after adjustment for confounding factors, Fergusson &amp; Boden conclude that cannabis usage between the ages of 14 and 18 was ‘Associated significantly’ with ‘lower levels of life and relationship satisfaction, lower income and higher levels of unemployment and welfare dependency.’ (2011, p. 974)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, unlike many prominent proponents of legalisation, I’m a true believer in democracy. If working-class communities genuinely believe that the best way to combat cannabis is through legalisation, then who am I to argue. The reality is quite the contrary. While many, like Lib Dem</p>
<p>Norman Lamb falsely claim that Brits want cannabis to be legalised. (Doward, 2016, para. 1) A comprehensive poll showed that the British public oppose cannabis legalisation by forty-nine to thirty-two percent. (Jordan, 2015, para. 7) Moreover, various surveys show that those groups who are amongst the hardest hit by cannabis, namely the poor and ethnic 6 minorities, often hold the toughest legal views. In 2010 30% of intermediate non-manual workers had used cannabis compared to 10% of unskilled manual workers. (Park, Curtice &amp; Thompson, 2007, p. 127) Likewise, ‘restrictive views’ on cannabis were higher among those with lower educational attainment. In 2001, just 25% of those with a degree held ‘restrictive’ views compared to 40% of those with A levels as highest qualification and 61% with no qualifications. (Park, Curtice &amp;Thompson, 2007, p. 126)</p>
<p>Even an Ipsos Mori poll which found a slight majority of the overall public in favour of decriminalisation, found that this was supported by only 25% of Asians and 41% of blacks, compared to 55% of whites. (Ames &amp; Worsley, 2013, p. 17) Is this really surprising? After all, the dark world of drug-related crime, violence and addiction hit harder in the streets of Hull than they do in Hampstead. If we as a society, truly care about those who suffer the most at the hands of cannabis, maybe we should take the revolutionary approach of listening to what they think we should do about it.</p>
<p><strong> 5) SOLUTIONS AND PROPOSALS</strong></p>
<p>Having demonstrated the toxic and damaging effects of cannabis on our society we must consider how we can best eradicate it. In 1999, The Runciman report was published, calling for the decriminalisation of cannabis and concluding that … ‘The present law on cannabis produces more harm than it prevents.’ (Runciman Report, 1999). This paper fully agrees that the present laws produce more harm than they prevent. However, this is not due to our nation’s refusal to give in to the drug completely, but because we refuse to properly confront it. Law enforcement Insisting the only way to tackle drug criminality in working class communities is to capitulate to those terrorising them by legalising their product is defeatist madness. The legislative framework and established penalties for the possession of cannabis are, in theory, suitable and rigorous. The maximum sentence for cannabis possession stands at five years’ imprisonment. It is not therefore the theoretical legislative provision that is at fault, we require no new dramatic laws or hard-line legislation. To eradicate cannabis, we require only the practical application of existing legal provision by responsible judges and a police service, uniformly educated in and committed to this endeavour.</p>
<p>The Runciman report itself acknowledged that: ‘almost no one is given an immediate custodial sentence solely for possession of cannabis.’ (Runciman Report, 1999, p. 105) Real deterrence in the form of strict criminal penalties must be consistently enforced to stem the demand side of the trade. Police forces in the United Kingdom should operate a zero-tolerance approach to cannabis possession, with every case leading to arrest and a formal criminal record. In addition, the criminal justice system ought to implement a ‘two strikes’ policy. Upon a second arrest for cannabis possession the individual must always be given a prison sentence of meaningful length. This can be enforced in several ways. Rigorous, visible and aggressive policing can drive up the price of cannabis while mitigating the drug’s negative secondary societal consequences. Community policing must, once again, be the focus of our law enforcement.</p>
<p>Areas synonymous with youth cannabis usage must be visibly policed  and dimly lit, urban, cannabis ‘trouble spots’ should be provided, where possible, with better lighting provision and mainstream</p>
<p>public access. The two-tier, confused policing of cannabis must also be immediately halted, while drug-snobbery and police profiling stamped out. Why are extensive bag searches and sniffer dogs common place at music festivals whose attendees are predominantly working class, such as Creamfields, while glittercovered Home County revellers at Glastonbury can visibly consume drugs without consequence?</p>
<p>The message that drugs are ok so long as secondary behaviour does not cause a nuisance must end &#8211; replaced by the message that taking drugs is wrong full-stop. Similarly, distinctions between supposed ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ drugs are largely unhelpful. The consumption of any illegal drug is morally wrong and so the use of all drugs must be discouraged with equal vigour. Equally as important is the insistence that our police force consistently and fairly enforce the law and that certain, politically motivated members of the police hierarchy, who have sought to enact a backdoor decriminalisation process, stop.</p>
<p>In a 2013 study, 103 officers out of 150 interviewed admitted they did not always arrest for cannabis possession. (Warburton May &amp; Hough, 2005, p. 118) One officer stated: ‘I never nick anyone for cannabis, and never will, unless it’s a van load.’ (Warburton May &amp; Hough, 2005, p. 119) Nowhere is this problem better illustrated as in County Durham, who’s Police Chief Constable, Mick Barton, has taken it upon himself to give criminals in the county permission to grow skunk for their own consumption. (Evans, 2015, para. 1)</p>
<p>Sweden provides a useful case study into the potential effectiveness of this approach. Largely considered to have the toughest cannabis laws in Europe, few consider the drug ‘soft.’ Police have pursued a zero-tolerance approach with the vast majority of instances of possession leading to prosecution. This, coupled with the visible and proactive ‘disturb and annoy’ tactics of the national police force (Mapes, 2016, p. 1) have delivered a cannabis usage rate of just 3%. Lower than any other nation in Northern, Western or Southern Europe, with the exception of Lithuania, on 2%. (European monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction, 2016)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment and education</strong></p>
<p>Further, we must counter the false claim that only legalisation can allow for effective and compassionate treatment for those who have become mentally dependent. Judgement-free, abstinence based assistance for those struggling, but willing to cease their habitual high should be well funded and available. This should be coupled with early intervention for those who have developed mental health problems. Likewise, we cannot be seen to be shying away from the debate on drugs, why would we? The facts and the evidence regarding the harmfulness of cannabis stand in our support. Education, countering fanciful claims that cannabis is ‘twenty-two thousand’ times less dangerous than alcohol ,should be comprehensive. Of course, there could indeed be occasional situations in which cannabis might be a small force for good. Whilst it possesses no curative potential, it is reasonable to conduct a serious and evidence based debate on the merits of tightly-regulated, prescriptive cannabinoids medication for the relief of specific symptoms in exceptional circumstances. In certain situations, morphine is of invaluable  medical assistance. Using heroin recreationally is of great societal and personal damage. Nonetheless, this tiny element of cannabis usage has long been hijacked by those dogmatic in their pursuit of legalised recreational usage and until this ends, progress will be difficult.</p>
<p>Similarly, this paper is not an attack on the middle class in general, or even all those members of the middle class who smoke the drug. While sensible support networks and access to early intervention may help many navigate the pitfalls of cannabis, schizophrenia and depression respect not income nor family stability. It’s our societal responsibility to safeguard all our people from a drug that may not, but may well, ruin their life.</p>
<p><strong> CONCLUSION </strong></p>
<p>However, most of those pushing for cannabis legalisation aren’t doing so because they truly believe it is in the best interests of anyone’s health or even finances. They’re doing so because a world that gets high, is a world that appeals to them. If cannabis was legalised it would be a monumental mistake impossible to reverse. We owe it to everyone to resist, with all our might, the ‘inevitable’ social normalisation and legislative legalisation of cannabis.</p>

		<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Marijuana (Cannabis sativa) is the most commonly used illicit drug by pregnant women, but information is limited about the effects of prenatal cannabis exposure on foetal development. The present study evaluated the influence of early maternal marijuana use on foetal growth.</p>
<p>Women electing voluntary saline-induced abortions were recruited at a mid-gestational stage of pregnancy (weeks 17-22), and detailed drug use and medical histories were obtained. Toxicological assays (maternal urine and foetal meconium) were used in conjunction with the maternal report to assign groups. Subjects with documented cocaine and opiate use were excluded.</p>
<p>Main developmental outcome variables were foetal weight, foot length, body length, and head circumference; ponderal index was also examined. Analyses were adjusted for maternal alcohol and cigarette use. Marijuana (n=44)- and non-marijuana (n=95)-exposed foetuses had similar rates of growth with increased age. However, there was a 0.08-cm (95% CI -0.15 to -0.01) and 14.53-g (95% CI -28.21 to 0.86) significant reduction of foot length and body weight, respectively, for marijuana-exposed foetuses.</p>
<p>Moreover, foetal foot length development was negatively correlated with the amount and frequency of marijuana use reported by the mothers. These findings provide evidence of a negative impact of prenatal marijuana exposure on the mid-gestational foetal growth even when adjusting for maternal use of other substances well known to impair foetal development.

		<p>Beery points to 50 deaths in 2016, most linked to drugs</p>
<p>Dr. Jeff Beery doesn’t agree with those who think marijuana is a relatively harmless drug that carries medicinal qualities and should even be winked at for recreational purposes.</p>
<p>But Beery doesn’t just think marijuana is a gateway to more dangerous drugs.</p>
<p>“It’s a gateway to hell,” he says flatly.</p>
<p>Beery’s perspective is based on four years serving as Highland County coroner, with more than a decade before that as a deputy coroner. He provided statistics this week from 2016 on 50 fatalities he investigated last year that he deemed suspicious, or at least unusually odd or interesting.</p>
<p>Beery said there has been a steady increase in deaths related one way or another to drugs, raising fatalities connected to illicit drugs to alarming proportions. He said the word “epidemic” is not sufficient to describe the toll being taken on Highland County.  “It’s a craze, not an epidemic,” he said, adding that “epidemic” implies something beyond people’s control.</p>
<p>The 50 cases provided by Beery from 2016 range from deaths by car crashes, burns, gun shots, heart attacks, hyperthermia and suicides to asphyxia and embolisms. But most of them have a common denominator, he said – the presence of drug use, or a history of drug use.</p>
<p>At least eight cases out of the 50 cited by Beery include marijuana as a factor contributing to the fatalities, in his opinion. Six fatalities were connected to heroin, three to cocaine, eight to amphetamines, including methamphetamine, and several to drugs like Xanax, Valium, Clonazepam and, especially, Fentanyl, which has been increasingly found mixed with heroin.</p>
<p>Beery blames a lax attitude by society and particularly by elected officials, including at the state and federal level, for contributing to the rise in drug-related deaths. He said former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder’s decision not to pursue marijuana charges at the federal level “opened the door to the wild progression of illicit drugs.”</p>
<p>Holder consistently expressed views on marijuana that were opposed to treating the drug as seriously as other narcotics. In a 2016 PBS interview, after he was no longer attorney general, Holder said, “It’s hard for me to imagine ever decriminalizing crack cocaine, drugs like that. But the whole question of should marijuana be decriminalized, I mean, that’s a conversation I think that we should engage in.”</p>
<p>Beery is aware of the fierce pushback among many people and organizations to his stand on marijuana. Groups like the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) – whose mission is “to move public opinion sufficiently to legalize the responsible use of marijuana by adults, and to serve as an advocate for consumers to assure they have access to high quality marijuana that is safe, convenient and affordable,” according to its website – have won referendums and convinced legislatures to at least legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Many patients suffering from certain serious illnesses or chronic pain insist that marijuana is the only effective relief they have found. Beery disagrees, saying marijuana has no medicinal qualities. He blames Ohio’s Republican-led “so-called conservative” legislature for caving in on the medical marijuana issue, even though the consequences of marijuana use and cultivation are obvious, especially in southern Ohio, he said.</p>
<p>“Just look at Pike County,” said Beery, referring to the murders last year of the Rhoden family, where a large marijuana growing operation worth hundreds of thousands of dollars on the street was found.  Beery said a lax attitude about border security and drugs also contributes to the problem.</p>
<p>Beery said that while investigating deaths in recent years, “I would see other things,” ranging from marijuana to heroin to cocaine that, to him, were obvious contributors not just to overdoses but to car wrecks, gun shots, homicides, burns and suicides.</p>

        	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>A new study released today by JAMA Psychiatry found that rates of marijuana use and marijuana addiction increased significantly more in states that passed medical marijuana laws as compared to states that have not. Examining data from 1992 to 2013, researchers concluded that medical marijuana laws likely contributed to an increased prevalence of marijuana and marijuana-addicted users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Politicians and pro-pot special interests are quick to tout the benefits of medical marijuana legalization, but it&#8217;s time to see through the haze &#8212;     medical marijuana has gone completely unregulated,&#8221; said SAM President Kevin Sabet. &#8220;More people in these states are suffering from an addiction to marijuana that harms their lives and relationships, while simultaneously more have begun using marijuana. No one wants to see patients denied something that might help them, but this study underscores the fact that &#8220;medical&#8221; and &#8220;recreational&#8221; legalization are blurred lines. Smoked marijuana is not medicine, and has not been proven safe and effective as other FDA-approved medications have.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study&#8217;s researchers wrote that increases in marijuana use in states with medical marijuana laws &#8220;may have resulted from increasing availability, potency, perceived safety, [or] generally permissive attitudes.&#8221; They conclude that &#8220;changing state laws (medical or recreational) may also have adverse public health consequences.&#8221;  Evidence demonstrates that marijuana &#8212;     which has skyrocketed in average potency over the past decades &#8212;     is addictive and harmful to the human brain, especially when used by adolescents. Moreover, in states that have already legalized the drug, there has been an increase in drugged driving crashes and youth marijuana use. States that have legalized marijuana have also failed to shore up state budget shortfalls with marijuana taxes, continue to see a thriving black market, and are experiencing a continued rise in alcohol sales.</p>

		<p><strong>Alzheimer’s and Marijuana ?</strong></p>
<p>An estimated 200,000 people in the United States under age 65 are living with younger-onset Alzheimer’s disease. And hundreds of thousands more are coping with mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to Alzheimer’s and other dementias.</p>
<p>“It’s beyond epidemic proportions. There truly is a tidal wave of Alzheimer’s disease,” said Dr. Vincent Fortanasce, a clinical professor of neurology in Southern California who is also a renowned Catholic bioethicist, author and radio host.</p>
<p>Fortanasce, a member of Legatus’ San Juan Capistrano Chapter, for several years has studied Alzheimer’s disease, its underlying causes and treatments. Through his research, he believes there may be a link between chronic use of marijuana — especially when started at a young age — and Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the link</strong></p>
<p>Fortanasce notes that medical research shows chronic users of marijuana, in particular the kind with high quantities of THC, have reduced volume in the hippocampus, the region of the brain responsible for memory and learning. In Alzheimer’s disease, Fortanasce said, medical researchers have also noticed reduced hippocampus volume with increased B-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.</p>
<p>Taking into account other factors, such as skyrocketing obesity rates and lack of exercise, Fortanasce argues that chronically smoking marijuana and consuming products laced with cannabis are harming the long-term mental health of millions of young Americans. He is trying to convince the American Academy of Neurology to conduct a major survey to see if people diagnosed with dementia have also smoked marijuana.</p>

		<p>In 2014, recreational cannabis use was legalized in Colorado, and seven other states have since followed suit. With an ever-expanding part of the population using marijuana to cure a number of ailments, researchers at Colorado State University have investigated its effects on mood. The researchers &#8211; led by Lucy Troup, assistant professor in the university&#8217;s Department of Psychology &#8211; publish their findings in the journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>They note that the &#8220;relationship between cannabis use and symptomatology of mood and anxiety disorders is complex,&#8221; adding that although &#8220;a great deal of research exists and continues to grow, the evidence remains contradictory.&#8221; Troup and colleagues point to a large international survey published in 2013, in which 5.2 percent of respondents reported that they used cannabis to alleviate depressive symptoms. Meanwhile, a survey of medical marijuana users in California revealed that 26.1 percent of participants reported therapeutic benefits for depression, and 37.8 percent reported benefits for anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;This trend of self-medication for conditions other than the one prescribed is too large to ignore when investigating the associations between cannabis use and mood disorders,&#8221; write the Colorado State University researchers.</p>
<p>They add that this increases &#8220;the need to include recreational users for research, especially when the casual user group are most likely recreational users and seem to sustain the greatest deficits in mood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is cannabis used correctly for self-medication? For their study, Troup and colleagues wanted to focus on Colorado, which was the first state to legalize recreational marijuana.</p>
<p>As such, they conducted an in-depth, questionnaire-based study of 178 legal cannabis users who were aged 18-22.</p>
<p>They divided their participants into three groups based on self-reported use: a control group who never used cannabis, a casual user group, and a group of chronic users.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the participants who were categorized with subclinical depression, and who also used cannabis to treat their depressive symptoms, scored lower on anxiety symptoms than on their depressive symptoms. In short, they were more depressed than anxious.</p>
<p>The researchers also say that the self-reported anxiety sufferers were found to be more anxious than depressed.</p>
<p>Study co-author Jacob Braunwalder, a researcher in Troup&#8217;s laboratory, says that &#8220;if they were using cannabis for self-medication, it wasn&#8217;t doing what they thought it was doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The questionnaire used in the study was developed by co-author Jeremy Andrzejewski. Called the Recreational Cannabis Use Evaluation, the questionnaire delved into users&#8217; habits, including whether they smoked cannabis or used stronger products such as hash oils or edibles.</p>
<p>The researchers say that inconsistencies in previous studies are better understood when considering how cannabis use is reported. &#8220;Phytocannabinoid type and strength is not consistent between studies,&#8221; they say, &#8220;and there have been significant changes in the strength of these products post-legalization.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Infrequent users have stronger relationship with negative mood&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Troup and colleagues say that it is important to point out that they looked at the residual effects of cannabis use, not administration of specific doses.</p>
<p>However, they do note that their results &#8220;suggested that cannabis use had an effect on measurements of mood disorder symptomatology. In particular, those who used cannabis less frequently, the casual user group, had the strongest correlations with overall score and negative effect on the CES-D [Center for Epidemiological Studies depression scale].&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the researchers did not observe a relationship with pre-anxiety symptoms in the cannabis user groups, compared with controls.</p>
<p>The researchers emphasize that their study does not conclude that cannabis causes depression or anxiety. It also does not show that cannabis cures these conditions. However, they add that their analysis displays a need for further study regarding how cannabis affects the brain.</p>
<p>Andrzejewski adds that &#8220;there is a common perception that cannabis relieves anxiety,&#8221; but this has not been fully backed by research.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important not to demonize cannabis, but also not to glorify it,&#8221; adds Troup. &#8220;What we want to do is study it, and understand what it does. That&#8217;s what drives us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Concluding their study, the researchers write:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our data indicate that infrequent users have a stronger relationship with negative mood. Our data suggested that those that use cannabis casually scored higher on the CES-D scale for depression, and consequently could be at greater risk for developing pre-depression symptomology compared to both chronic users and controls.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is important to note that the study has limitations, including:</p>
<ul>
<li> Sample size</li>
<li> Control for phytocannabinoids in terms of strength and type</li>
<li> Confounding variables such as multiple drug use and alcohol consumption</li>
<li> The self-report design</li>
<li>A limited interpretation of depression due to lack of clinical evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, the researchers say that their study &#8220;provides a starting point from which to design controlled experiments to further investigate the relationship between mood and cannabis use in a unique population.&#8221;</p>

		<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>It has long been established that smoking tobacco during pregnancy causes increased risk of miscarriage, increased placental problems, reduction of birth weight, and a variety of birth defects [1].</p>
<p>In light of the recent legalization of marijuana in Colorado, Washington, Alaska and Washington, D.C., we felt it important to establish and publicize the causative relationship between cannabis usage and embryological outcomes. The main psychoactive cannabinoid in marijuana is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which has a half-life of approximately 8 days in fat deposits and can be detected in blood for up to 30 days before becoming entirely eliminated from the blood [2]. These characteristics act as a direct risk factor to the developing embryo, as the maternal tissues act as reservoirs for THC and other cannabinoids.</p>
<p>Certain drugs cross the placenta to reach the embryo in the same manner as oxygen and other nutrients [3]. Drugs consumed during pregnancy can act directly on the embryo, or they can alter placental function, which is critical for normal growth and development.</p>
<p>Ingestion of drugs can interfere with these functions, resulting in compromised fetal development and growth [3]. THC readily crosses the placenta, which, in conjunction with slow fetal clearance, results in prolonged fetal exposure to THC, even after consumption is discontinued [2].</p>
<p>The use of marijuana in early pregnancy is associated with many of the same risks as tobacco, including miscarriage, congenital malformations, and learning disabilities [4]. Adverse effects of marijuana use during pregnancy have been exacerbated over the years, as THC levels in marijuana have increased nearly 25-fold since 1970 [5]. This paper looks to examine recent studies on cannabinoids and embryonic development in order to establish the mechanisms through which these cannabinoids act.</p>

		<p>Kuei Y. Tseng was awarded $1.95 million by NIH for a five-year study of &#8220;Adolescent Maturation of the Prefrontal Cortex: Modulation by Cannabinoids.&#8221; Regular marijuana use by teens can stop the brain from maturing, according to a new study by scientists at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL. Published March 4 in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, the study is the first to establish a causal link between repeated cannabinoid exposure during adolescence and an interruption of the normal maturation processes in the prefrontal cortex, a region in the brain&#8217;s frontal lobe, which regulates decision making and working memory and undergoes critical development during adolescence.</p>
<p>The findings apply to natural cannabinoids, including those in marijuana, and a new generation of more potent, synthetic cannabinoid products. THC, the compound in marijuana that produces feelings of euphoria, is of particular concern. The chemical can be manipulated, resulting in varying concentrations between marijuana strains – from 2 to 28 percent. A higher concentration of THC and increasing use by younger teens poses a greater risk for long term negative effects, the study finds. Kuei Y. Tseng, MD, PhD, associate professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at the Chicago Medical School at RFUMS and principal investigator of the study, blames the CB1 cannabinoid receptor, which governs neuronal communication, for the drug&#8217;s long -lasting effect.</p>
<p>Tseng and his team of researchers used rat models in testing the effect of cannabinoid exposure during narrow age windows and analyzed the way information is later processed by the adult prefrontal cortex. They discovered that when CB1 receptors are repeatedly activated by cannabinoids during early adolescence, development of the prefrontal cortex stalls in that phase. The window of vulnerability represents two thirds of the span of adolescence. Test animals showed no such effect when exposure occurred in late adolescence or adulthood.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have conclusively demonstrated that an over activation of the CB1 receptor during the window equivalent to age 11 to 17 in humans, when the prefrontal cortex is still developing, will inhibit its maturation and have a long lasting effect on its functions,&#8221; Tseng said.</p>
<p>The study shows how chronic cannabis use by teens can cause persistent behavioral deficits in adulthood, including problems with attention span and impulse control. The findings also add to prior research that draws a correlation between adolescent marijuana abuse and the development of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>The discovery, which comes as a growing number of states are considering legalization of marijuana for both medicinal and recreational use, calls for the attention of physicians who prescribe medical marijuana and policy makers who, according to Tseng, &#8220;will have to establish regulations to take advantage of the beneficial effects of marijuana while minimizing its detrimental potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>Researchers are focusing on developing outcome measures to reveal the degree of frontal lobe maturation and history of drug exposure. The challenge now, Tseng said, is to find ways to return the frontal lobe back to a normal state either through pharmacological or cognitive interventions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Future research will tell us what other mechanisms can be triggered to avoid this type of impairment of the frontal lobe,&#8221; Tseng said. &#8220;Ultimately, we want to restore the prefrontal cortex.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supported by RFUMS, the research was funded primarily through NIH Grant R01-MH086507 to Tseng and also by a 2012 seed grant from the Brain Research Foundation.</p>

		<p>I am not a long-time user.  I used casually for about six months, but then suddenly had a terrible experience with marijuana-induced psychosis.   I had moved from a state where is was illegal, to Washington.  A dispensary sold me something incredibly strong just recently, in March.   It was a joint mixed with a marijuana wax- I didn’t even know what that was.  I was SO naive, but there is literally NOTHING out there that lets consumers know that ANYthing even remotely bad can happen.</p>
<p>As long as I didn’t drive under the influence, what could go wrong?   I thought all pot was “safe.”    The irony is that I am nearly 40, a stay-at-home mom with honor roll kids, no history, ZERO history with drug usage, or ANY depression, mental illness etc etc.. NONE.  I never used marijuana before I moved to Washington. I literally just set out to listen to music and unwind while I got the house clean….awaiting the arrival of my husband who was gone on a business trip.   My kids were on Spring break, at a friend’s house.</p>
<p>About halfway through I felt very dizzy and unbalanced… So I thought I just needed to sit down, or maybe eat.. I looked at the glass of wine I had poured… and dumped it in the drain…. Then I had a sudden disturbing image of myself biting THROUGH the wine glass… It came over and over.  Bite the glass….. the words wouldn’t leave my head…. I’m biting glass.  My heart began to race, my hands began to shake. I felt freezing cold, yet was sweating. Then I was feeling a sudden surge of Adrenalin and was panic stricken.  I began having suicidal ideations, in MINUTES…</p>
<p><strong>Shooting Myself and Biting Glass</strong></p>
<p>Over and over and over… shoot yourself… bite through the glass… shoot yourself…and much worse.. it was as if a tape of my worst nightmares were playing over and over and over again in my head…and it was just as physical as it was psychological….. With absolute sincerity, I tell you that I barely made it through that night alive, and even the subsequent days and weeks… I still suffered terrible suicidal ideation……….</p>
<p>NEVER, ever did I have suicidal thoughts or feelings in my life. I am happy, well-adjusted, and a warm, outgoing person with lots of friends and a solid marriage.</p>
<p>Within days I began researching, because I KNEW what I had experienced was from smoking…again, I reiterate, I had nothing else in my system or history to indicate otherwise….and there it was.. All the research indicating that it WAS the pot.. Marijuana-induced psychosis is a proven thing and all too common. There is ZERO safety put in place in these recreational pot stores.  They don’t warn a consumer about strength, concentration or side effects.  It as if you are buying a glass of milk to them!! I later found out that marijuana wax is known as a “dab” and I am still unsure of what they really are…</p>
<p>No Warnings Against Psychosis! The ER in Olympia Washington sees on average TWO cases of marijuana-induced psychosis a DAY!! Yet we don’t hear of this!? Why not? I would have NEVER tried any medicine or drink that could even remotely do this to me, but thought I was using something as harmless as a glass of wine because they say it is.   I can’t even fully describe the horror of that night as it’s very, very hard to revisit. Thank you for warning people.  I am glad I was able to use some of the resources and information you have shared to help recover…….People need to know.  Marijuana can be deadly.   I almost lost everything to very casual use.</p>
<p>I am lucky to have health insurance and lucky that my husband could be with me.  My husband had to take an entire week off to stay home with me! Again how fortunate I am and I’m in the position to have someone that could do that.</p>
<p>I am lucky in that I am NOT an addict or addicted to it. So not using isn’t an issue….. I would never smoke pot again, but the suicidal ideation was so intense and such a terrible and traumatic experience…. It is hard to describe how horrific it is was and I’d rather be tortured than ever experience that again…. I just never thought that was even possible….    From BK, Washington</p>

		<p><strong>Marijuana Legalization Proposals Die in Committee</strong></p>
<p>[Alexandria, VA, April 12, 2017] &#8211;  Yesterday, an alliance of concerned citizens, public health experts, and safety officials soundly defeated two marijuana legalization bills in Maryland. The bills, which would have permitted commercial pot shops in communities throughout the state, died without a vote in the Maryland Senate last night. SAM Executive Vice President Jeff Zinsmeister and Maryland-based neuroscientist and SAM Science Advisor Dr.Christine Miller testified in Annapolis last month, urging the legislature to reject marijuana legalization and commercialization. AAA Mid-Atlantic also testified against the bills, citing traffic safety concerns due to drugged driving increases in states that have legalized marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a major victory in the effort to put public health and common sense before special interests,&#8221; said SAM Executive Vice President Jeff Zinsmeister. &#8220;The costs of legalization, including more stoned drivers on the roads causing fatalities, more people being driven into treatment for addiction, and higher regulatory costs far outweighed any benefit Maryland would see. The Big Marijuana lobbyists came into Maryland touting the notion that marijuana legalization would fix our criminal justice system and rake in millions &#8211; but Maryland smartly concluded that legalization actually exacerbates these issues. All they had to do was look to Colorado, where more minority youth are being arrested for marijuana and the state deficit is growing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that science and research, not profit, should drive what marijuana laws look like in our state,&#8221; said Dr. Christine Miller, a Maryland neuroscientist and member of SAM&#8217;s Science Advisory Board.  &#8220;The pro-marijuana lobby was looking to profit by selling a harmful, addictive substance that would harm our communities and endanger public safety. I&#8217;m proud that evidence-based policy putting health first prevailed in Maryland yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evidence demonstrates that marijuana &#8211; which has skyrocketed in average potency over the past decades &#8211; is addictive and harmful to the human brain, especially when used by adolescents. Moreover, in states that have already legalized the drug, there has been an increase in drugged driving crashes and youth marijuana use. States that have legalized marijuana have also failed to shore up state budget shortfalls with marijuana taxes, continue to see a thriving black market, and are experiencing a continued rise in alcohol sales.</p>
