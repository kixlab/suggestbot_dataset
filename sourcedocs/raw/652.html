  correct, all  people today share a

  other lines of humans that had descended from <i>Homo erectus</i> presumably became

	<span lang="en-us">final major cold period of the last</span>
  ice age.&nbsp; Until that time, all human evolution had occurred in the Old
  World.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">A 
  consequence of human migrations into new regions of the world has been 
  the extinction of many animal species indigenous to those areas.&nbsp; By 
  11,000 years ago, human hunters in the New World apparently had 
	<span lang="en-us">played a part in the extermination</span>
	<span lang="en-us">of </span>135 
  species of mammals, including 3/4 of the larger ones<span lang="en-us"> 
	(mammoths, mastodons, giant sloths, etc.)</span>.&nbsp; Most of these 
  extinctions apparently occurred within a few hundred years.&nbsp; It is
	<span lang="en-us">likely</span> 
  that the <span lang="en-us">rapidly </span>changing climate at the end of the last ice age was a 
  contributing factor.<span lang="en-us">&nbsp; However, the addition of human 
	hunters with spears to the existing top predators (mostly saber-toothed 
	cats, lions, and dire-wolves) very likely disrupted the equilibrium between 
	large herbivores and their predators.&nbsp; As a consequence there was a 
	major ecosystem disruption resulting in the rapid decline of both non-human 
	carnivores and their prey.&nbsp; Humans were very likely the trigger that set 
	off this &quot;trophic cascade&quot;.&nbsp; Unlike most other major predators, people 
	survived by switching their food quest to smaller animals and plants.</span></font></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial">F</font></span><font face="Arial">ollowing the arrival of aboriginal people in 
  Australia and Polynesians in New Zealand<span lang="en-us"> there were similar 
	dramatic animal extinctions</span>.&nbsp; In both <span lang="en-us">of

	directly</span> <span lang="en-us">responsible</span> <span lang="en-us">for</span> wiping out easily hunted species.&nbsp; 
  Large vulnerable marsupials were the main victims in Australia.<span lang="en-us">&nbsp; 
	Within 5,000 years following the arrival of humans,&nbsp;approximately 90% 
	of the marsupial species larger than a domesticated cat had become extinct 
	there.</span>&nbsp; In New 
  Zealand, it was mostly large flightless birds that were driven to extinction 
  by <span lang="en-us">human </span>hunters<span lang="en-us"> following their arrival in the 10th-13th 
	centuries A.D</span>.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial">It 
  is sobering to realize that the rate of animal and plant extinction has once 
  again accelerated dramatically.&nbsp; During the last century and a half, the 
  explosion in our global human population and our rapid technological 
  development has allowed us to move into and over-exploit most areas of our 
  planet<span lang="en-us"> including the oceans</span>.&nbsp; That exploitation has usually involved cutting down forests, 
  changing the courses of rivers, pushing wild animals and plants out of farm 
  and urban areas, polluting wetlands with pesticides and other man-made 
  chemicals, and industrial-scale hunting of large land animals, whales, and fish.&nbsp; 
  During the early 19th century, there were at least 40,000,000 bison roaming 
  the Great Plains of North America.&nbsp; By the end of that century, there 
  were only a few hundred remaining.&nbsp; They had been hunted to near 
  extinction with guns.&nbsp; The same fate came to the African elephant and 
  rhinoceros during the 20th century.&nbsp; Likewise, commercial fishermen have 
  depleted one species of fish after another during the last half century.&nbsp; 
  Governments have had to step in to try to stem the tide of these human 
  population effects on other species.&nbsp; However, they have been only 
  marginally successful.&nbsp; The World Conservation Union conservatively 
	estimates that 7,266 animal species and 8,323 plant and lichen species are 
	now at risk of extinction primarily due to human caused habitat degradation.&nbsp; 
	The endangered list includes<span lang="en-us"> 1/3</span> of all amphibian species, nearly 
	<span lang="en-us">1/2</span> of the turtles and tortoises,
	<span lang="en-us">1/4</span> of the mammals, <span lang="en-us">1/5</span> of the 
	sharks and rays, and <span lang="en-us">1/8</span> of the birds.&nbsp; This list does not 
	include the many millions of species that are still unknown to science.&nbsp; 
	It is likely that most of them will become extinct before they can be 
	described and studied.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Arial"><span lang="en-us">Are we genetically different from 
	our <i>Homo sapiens</i> ancestors who lived 10-20,000 years ago?&nbsp; The answer 
	is almost certainly yes.&nbsp; In fact, it is very likely that the rate of 
	evolution for our species has continuously accelerated since the 
	end of the last ice age, roughly 10,000 years ago.&nbsp; This is mostly due to 
	the fact that our human population has explosively grown and moved into new 
	kinds of environments, including cities, where we have been subject to new 
	natural selection pressures.&nbsp; For instance, our larger and denser 
	populations have made it far easier for contagious diseases, such as 
	tuberculosis, small pox, the plague, and influenza to rapidly spread through 
	communities and wreak havoc.&nbsp; This has exerted strong selection for 
	individuals who were fortunate to have immune systems that allowed them to 
	survive.&nbsp; There also has been a marked change in diet for most people since 
	the end of the last ice age.&nbsp; It is now less varied and predominantly vegetarian 
	around the globe with a heavy dependence on foods made from cereal 
	grains.&nbsp; It is likely that the human species has been able to adapt to 
	these and other new environmental pressures because it has acquired a 
	steadily greater genetic diversity.&nbsp; A larger population naturally has 
	more mutations adding variation to its gene pool simply because there are more 
	people.&nbsp; This happens even if the mutation rate per person remains the same.&nbsp; 
	However, the mutation rate may have actually increased because we have been exposed to new kinds of 
	man-made environmental pollution that 
	can cause additional mutations.</span></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><span lang="en-us">It is not clear what all of the 
	consequences of the environmental and behavioral changes for humans have 
	been.&nbsp; However, it does appear that the average human body size has 
	become somewhat shorter over the last 10,000 years, and we have acquired 
	widespread immunity to the more severe effects of some diseases such as 
	measles and influenza.</span></font></p>

	we say what direction human evolution will take in the future?&nbsp; This 
	is a fascinating question to consider but impossible to answer because of 
	innumerable unknown factors.&nbsp; Though, it is certain that we will
