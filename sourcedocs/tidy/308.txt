Brain death
There are a number of criteria for diagnosing brain death.

Ruling out other conditions

Before testing for brain death can begin, doctors must carry out a series of checks to ensure that the symptoms are not being caused by other factors, such as:

an overdose of illegal drugs, tranquillisers, poisons or other chemical agents

an abnormally low body temperature (hypothermia)

severe underactivity of the thyroid gland

Once these have been ruled out, tests are carried out to confirm brain death.

The diagnosis of brain death has to be made by 2 senior doctors. Neither of them can be involved with the hospital's transplant team.

The doctors will explain the tests to you and keep you informed about your loved one's condition at all times.
