Antelope Valley Solar Ranch
The Antelope Valley Solar Ranch 1 (AVSR1) is a 230 megawatt (MW AC ) photovoltaic power plant near Lancaster within Antelope Valley, in the western Mojave Desert, Southern California. It uses cadmium telluride modules made by the US thin-film manufacturer First Solar. The project was developed by First Solar and later bought by Exelon Corporation in 2011. The solar facility was fully commissioned in April 2014. [3] [4] [5]

Overview [ edit ]

In September 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a $646 million loan guarantee to support the project's construction.[1] This loan guarantee was part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[6] The project is expected to create 350 construction jobs and 20 permanent jobs.[1]

On February 20, 2013, the first 100 MW AC came online.[7] The plant will use approximately 3.8 million solar panels,[5] about 20% of which will be mounted on single-axis tracking racks.[1] When fully operational, the plant is expected to generate enough energy for 75,000 homes, displacing 140,000 tons of CO 2 .[7] The power generated by AVSR1 is being purchased by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) under a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement.[1][7]
