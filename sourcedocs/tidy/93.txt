What People Are Saying About Abort73...

Abort73 touched my heart because I was a pregnant 17 year old in 1973 and I was offered an abortion as a solution. I said No. That kid born in 1973 is now a responsible husband and father of 4 children of his own. I'm pretty sure he is glad he was born. I know I am! Sex: Female

Abort73 is one of the best sites I've come across. I didn't read the entire site, but I hope you've also covered info about the morning after pills. I'd like info about the reasons women give for later-term abortion as well. Age: 50-59

Abort73 is extremely informative with detailed facts that can be backed up. It shows truth with compassion for the women involved in abortion. The facts regarding abortion are easier to prove than I knew. The pro-choice side has no medical, political or spiritual basis for being correct. Age: 50-59

In my position as pro-choice, I was under the impression that women could only obtain an abortion up to 12 weeks, unless there was a danger to the health of the mother. It seems that I have been grossly uninformed in my beliefs. Age: 50-59

Your reasons are skewed and your information is irresponsible. You assume a correlation between child abuse and legalization of abortion. Child abuse has always been prevalent—only in the last 50 years has maltreatment of children received attention. Also, regarding more minorities having abortions and implying that is genocide. Perhaps fewer people of color have good access or money to spend on birth control. Maybe more minorities cannot afford to feed another mouth due to socioeconomic factors. To imply selective abortion based on race is irresponsible. Age: 40-49

Abort73 is a great resource. The information appears well-researched and even-headed. The only criticism I can make is that in your pages you do not report the fact that abortion and infanticide have been a plight since the beginning of humankind. To be fair you do imply it in the historical pages, but don't appear to address the issue further... Thank you again for your public service. I want to do more to advance the pro-life cause and I pray for the day when the rights of the unborn will be respected. Age: 25-29

I do not agree with your position on tubal pregnancy. No matter what the situation, taking a life is morally wrong. As you know, it is not always fatal for the mother & in some cases not fatal to the child. If death for the child occurs, it must occur naturally. If a child is dying of malnutrition, where it is too late to intervene, should we kill the child because death is inevitable? Age: 60-69

I think this website is way too biased. Statistics are thrown in there to make the point look good. There is flawed logic all over this website. I understand people have certain opinions about abortion, but to provide a chopped up Frankenstein website of various facts that happen to fit your views is unethical and debunks your credibility. If you want to have a scientific website, you need to leave your biased opinions out of it. Age: 20-24

(Abort73 is) Pretty one-sided. The fact that you think abortion is never the answer means you don't understand how pregnancy can endanger the life of a mother, nor do you empathize with children who would be born so malformed that they'd live short lives full of pain. Plus, you don't seem to have a plan for what we as a society would do with 800,000+ babies that would be born every year if abortion were not an option. As someone who works with kids in the foster care system, I find that to be critically shortsighted. Age: 25-29

I am very impressed with the way your "Common Objections" article, using only pure logic, dismantled the widely-accepted "reasons" to justify induced abortion. It is a welcome alternative to the moralistic emotionalism of pro-life lobbyists. Abort73 will be a resource for me as I agree with your organization's premise that education aimed at bringing about a change in attitude is the productive course of action to greatly reduce-and potentially eliminate-this unethical practice.

There is seriously a website that is anti-abortion?!?! Nowadays?!? Of course a man is in charge. Shame on you people for not being pro-choice in this lifetime. Every person is different, and not every baby should be born. Look what's happening in third-world countries! They keep having babies that are suffering. Birth control is what should be enforced more. No man will ever understand what it's like for a women. Not one. Why is this such a big deal for people who haven't been through that type of situation? You are all stuck in an ignorant bubble and need to take your f***ing blinders off. Seriously. Pull your heads out of your a** and maybe worry about the environment. For all you religious f***ers, YOU ARE LIVING A LIE!! God won't help you when our world is ending. Religion is for people who need to follow like sheep. Be different and unique instead of a follower and ignorant. I hope someone seriously reads this and changes their mind. It just blows my mind how people think.

I think Abort73.com is AWESOME! By reading the comments, I've come to realize that many women who have had abortions and still support 'the right to choose,' seem to be SO ANGRY! They REALLY lash out at those who support life'!! To me, it sound like they're using their anger to suppress their guilt! [Back in high school], because of going to public schools with VERY liberal teachers... , I became pretty liberal. When my cousin came to me and told me that she was pregnant by her boyfriend, who she hardly knew, I tried to talk her into getting an abortion! I told her that having a baby would ruin her future... THANK GOD, SHE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME and decided to keep the baby! ... After her healthy baby boy was born, and I saw him and held him for the first time, I began to feel SO guilty... Since then, my eyes have been opened, and I have been against abortion!!! Age: 50-59

After looking at your website, I find it an absolute disgrace that you are making women and young girls feel ashamed for having abortions. How dare any of you inflict your harsh, insensitive and outright ignorant views on abortion and how 'wrong' it is? You have no idea on what circumstances surround women who find themselves to be pregnant. These ridiculous comparisons and opinions on abortion only make females who have been through it feel guilty and wrong for doing what they have done.

I've learned that abortion isn't just one of those words you can forget about because it has such an impact in your life, whether it's happening to you or someone around you. It is a big deal, and it isn't okay for a woman to kill her baby. This is an issue that must be stopped and put to an end. Age: ≤14

I just want to say THANK YOU for what you do! I am extremely indebted to you guys for informing me about abortion! I am a Christian, came from a Christian family. I would never get pregnant before marriage, that's just how I was raised, but because of that fact my mom didn't think it right for me to see how violent abortion is, because "there's nothing you can do about it." So, it wasn't until late last year that I finally went to abort73, and I was shocked! I had no idea. Now I see. I'm not blind any more! I ended the ignorance! :) I just, say thank you!!! Thank you! Now I know that I CAN do something about it, and it's WORTH doing something about!!! <3 Sex: Female

(Through Abort73,) I have learned how to respond to more sophisticated pro-choice arguments such as those advanced by Nathan Nobis. There is, however, a limit to how far we can permeate. At the end of the day I realize that opposition to abortion is ultimately rooted in presuppositions that transcend the secular realm. Thus it is important to bring the atheistic pro-choice person who also supports infanticide or sees no value in human life to a belief in God before we can have a chance to convince him/her of the immorality of abortion. In short, the abortion debate encompasses more than just abortion. Age: 20-24

I think that what you're doing is admirable. However, abortion will take place even if made illegal. There are many cases of women seeking illegal ways to rid themselves of a pregnancy.

I respect the (Abort73) website.

Further, I respect and support your website as a source of information for pregnant women seeking answers concerning abortion, especially in a case that falls out the realm I above described. Overall, the website is a way to communicate the point of view without harassing women and subjecting your point of view to those not interested, so I actually support it.

I have always been very against abortion, but before visiting Abort73, I'm not sure how well I could have argued my position to a pro-choice friend. Now I know what I believe about preborn life, and I know WHY I believe it. I know how to argue what I know is true. I have learned so much and am constantly shocked, saddened, and DRIVEN by the statistics on Abort73. This is by far my favorite pro-life website. The information is overwelming. Many essays and reports have benefited from the excelent points and reliable statisitcs you give! I also apreciate the links to other pro-life organizations and sites, some of which I have been able to get involved with and may not have found if not for you! My favorite thing about this website is how... friendly it is... as in, not the least bit dull and boring. It's well formatted, and very modern looking. It grabs your attention and keeps it. Plus, it looks very "teen"... and I'm sure a large percentage of your visiters are teens. I have ordered 5 shirts from you and more for my friends, who LOVE them! I was impressed by how fast even a very large order arrived. I LOVE that the shirts are comfortable and totally cute, and that they fit well. They come in great colors! Most importantly for me, I feel like I'm on a mission when I'm wearing an Abort73 shirt... like people are watching. I believe when I wear the shirts, it's my responsibility to be informed about the issue of abortion and ready to explain the meaning and reason for the shirt whenever someone asks. I usually carry the cards around too, just in case. I also really appreciate the idea that one slogan isn't going to change someone's mind, and the logic of pointing them to the site. That makes a lot of sense! I am so impressed with Abort73.com, I talk about it to my frinds all the time and I highly reccomend it!

I always felt I was "pro choice" in the sense that abortion would never be right for me, but if that's the choice others around me made, I would respect it. I now feel I could never condone this act of violence, and my heart is breaking for all these babies who were "discarded" in this unmerciful, cruel way. It was beautiful to read how the fetus forms from the moment of conception through to birth. I guess I never really thought of a baby as a baby when it's in the blastocyst stage. I feel relief now for standing up to my husband and family when they told me I had too abort my fifth child. He's a happy, 11-week old, thriving baby now, and I thank God I have him everyday.

I would have actually described abortion as a "severe injustice." However, I have never actively promoted this belief or done anything to try to change the hearts or minds of those who support the legal right to abortion in the US (except for debating the topic with such people, including my own family and significant other, and occasionally, passively passing along information that support my beliefs to my friends). Stumbling on [the Abort73] website and exploring the information available has compelled me to do a lot more research on my own and fueled my longtime belief - my gut instinct - that abortion is inhumane. I will do anything I can to learn more about this problem and what can be done. I also appreciate that this site is not dripping with Christian-based sentiment. As a non-Christian (though I hold many fundamental Christian values), I feel that, in general, constantly intertwining religious views with moral beliefs does not sit well with most non-Christians who are in need of convincing. I'm glad that [Abort73] seems someone recognizes this. Age: 25-29

If people could tell from the shirt that it is pro-life they might never say something to me. But because it is ambiguous, they approach me and we have constructive dialogue. One thing that is particularly useful to me is the medical testimony about where life begins. I've used those quotes countless times.

I had also never seen a concise, non-dramatized presentation of what actually happens during an abortion. Opinions are articulately expressed and drawn from a wide variety of resources; it upholds a pro-life stance without scare tactics and provides practical arguments against abortions legality.

This is the best pro-life website I have visited -- in fact, it may be one of the best "cause" websites I've seen. The first things I see when the home page appears are 2- and 5-minute videos succinctly explaining the pro-life case for the unborn. This is a perfect design, because short visuals are the best way to communicate your message in a hyper-visual culture. The second things are noticed were the five reasons for pro-life at the bottom of the home page. Clicking the first one brings up a compelling yet brief argument, which is then followed up by a possible objection, which is then answered by the next article. I love how each article ends with a possible objection from the prochoice side and then a link to the pro-life rebuttal. Each well-crafted argument invigorates my mind and makes me want to read more. These pages are addicting -- I keep on clicking the links at the bottom! I absolutely love the format and the way the case for the unborn is unfolded. I am planning a pro-life tract and this website will definitely be my main source and structure. You guys should really be commended for creating such a superb site for a superb cause. Age: 20-24

I once believed that while abortion was wrong, it could not be made illegal because that would be to legislate morality, and you cannot make people believe as you do. By reading the articles on this site, however, I have come to see that while people cannot be made to change, to do nothing about it is just as wrong as doing the act yourself. People cannot be allowed to just do whatever they want. Should we make all murder legal then, because some people will do it anyway? No. We have a moral obligation, as the human race, to mete out justice. And letting people make the choice to abort their children is just dead wrong. Age: 25-29

[Abort73] has been enlightening. I used to think I was Pro-Choice but not Pro-Abortion.

But look at drugs, education is out there but people still use them. I love this program as it does education. I'm beginning to think abortion should not be a choice anyone should be allowed to make.

My thoughts on abortion have really been developed and shaped by the information I've found on Abort73 and sites like it. My stance on the issue is more clarified and clear now... I was always pro-life, but never really knew how to explain my position with sound knowledge, and I knew I couldn't simply rely on my Christian faith (so many people just don't care about what God has to say). Abort73 really helped me have information on just what it was I stood for, and now any chance I get, I tell my friends about what I've learned.

This is a fantastic website. I like how it presents factual information on abortion as opposed to presenting emotionally opinionated statements... I think the best way to help pro-choice people understand, or even convert to the pro-life position (or at least have an open mind about it) is by simply giving the facts and exposing truths. Using reputable sources and updated information is important. And I like how the website is appealing to people who aren't religious too. You don't have to be religious to be pro-life. Your site also targets young people, which I think is important. I know WAY TOO MANY people who are pro-choice out of ignorance. IGNORANCE IS MURDER. Way to go Abort73!!! Age: 18-19

I love the [approach] of Abort73. I do not believe that the government should be able to control what we do or do not do with our own bodies, but I believe that anything can be prevented through education. I remember in my Family Life class in middle school, whenever someone asked any of us what we would do if we got pregnant, we would just simply state abortion. No one knew anything about the process and its morals; it just seemed like a mystical alternative to taking care of a baby. Then, in the eighth grade, we were assigned a research paper that could be on anything we wanted it to be. Because I knew little about the subject of abortion, I chose that topic. At the beginning of that paper, I was completely pro-abortion. But when I presented my project to the class a few months later, I had completely changed my view on the subject. And after presenting to my class, many of friends went up to me and told me that I had changed their opinions of abortion too! I am so glad that Abort73 is here to let everyone know the facts about abortion. Hopefully through this campaign, many lives will be saved. Age: 15-17

I had an abortion at 18, and I've never for a moment regretted that decision or second-guessed the wisdom of it. I suppose that makes me a monster according this website's worldview, which mocks the idea that a women could have an abortion because they care about being the best mother they possibly could be, and wouldn't want to bring another human being into the world without doing everything in their power to provide the best life possible for him or her. I don't understand how people could be so blind to these nuanced but honest reasons. Its because I care about children and being a good mother that I would rather 'kill' something that had the possibility of becoming a child while it is still a tiny clump of cells than have a child I wouldn't be able to care for the way it would deserve, or abandon it to the vagaries of the adoption system where I would have no idea of how it could be raised.

I have always believed firmly that abortion was wrong, but I had been struggling with the morality and even viability of working to outlaw it... the job of the government isn't to legislate morality. People have free will, and with it, a right to make even wrong choices. They'll be the worse off for it, but they can't be stopped from sinning. We can't completely outlaw smoking, or jumping off bridges, or insults. These are all bad things, but to make them criminal would be illegal. And so I had put abortion into this category of things that we can't legislate for other people, and I was affected by the arguments that outlawing abortion would only cause women to seek dangerous illegal abortions in Mexico or someplace. But this site argued the case against abortion in such a clear, rational way... completely free of the fanaticism and slogans and repetition I've winced at in other pro-life stances. [It showed me that] it is okay and even necessary to outlaw things that cross the line of hurting another person... My previous stance seems so weak... This is the best pro-life site I've ever seen. I saw that the issue with illegal abortions has been addressed on this site, to my pleasant surprise, and of course the arguments I already knew are discussed as soundly as I've ever seen them.

Primarily emotive, subjective vomit combined with thinly disguised opinion masquerading as medical 'fact', especially the evidence cited in defense of your claims that "individual human life begins at fertilization". The section of your site that infuriated me the most was the area dealing with the morality of abortion in regard to rape victims. Again premised on the (subjective) assumption that life begins at conception, surely even ignorant individuals such as yourselves cannot truly think that a few examples of anecdotal evidence represents the majority of rape victims.

A great piece of propaganda that decries the death of 115,000 foetuses per day, without actually suggesting any ways that the Earth and her rapidly dwindling resources could possibly support an extra 115,000 people being born every day. Age: 25-29

I think your site looks very enticing and yet you rely on old data to give the appearance that your site relies on new research. Your site also manipulates data to support your agenda using "data" that has been poorly executed and purposely misleading. This is unfortunate as well as scientifically reprehensible. I have been searching to find a pro-life site or even pro-life research studies that rely on very current science (past 6-10 years) to make its point and can find none. Instead, all I find are sites that mix very old data with a tiny amount of "newish" data in an attempt to skew the real results of the research. Your site does this as does every single anti-choice site. Age: 35-39

I was so shocked by the images of the 1st trimester embryos and fetuses that were violently dismembered during the abortion process. Although I have 2 children, I never really knew how developed a 1st trimester baby was until I saw the photos on the Abort73 website. The sheer brutality of the abortion procedure violates my conscience & I simply cannot accept that it is perfectly legal for a women to slaughter her own unborn child. I am extremely moved by your videos. Everything you say on your videos is extremely poignant & overflowing with truth. Age: 35-39

[Abort73] is Wonderful! As a mother of 2 boys with severe autism there are many in the autism community that want to locate a detectable gene that can be found on prenatal tests so parents can be informed of the likelihood of their unborn child being autistic. This angers me because truly parents who chose to abort these children have no idea of the love and beauty that can be found through a child effected by autism. Its a disorder...not a death sentence.

I'm 21 and I just watched [your] video about abortion and I think it was the most shocking thing but in reality it's something I think everyone considering it should see. It broke my heart because my 19 year old best friend just had one and I think if she had seen this and knew the pain her baby felt she would have never done it... Age: 21

Abort73.com has encouraged me to stand up for the voiceless and fight against abortion even if it is by simply wearing one of your t-shirts. I am incredibly thankful for this creative way to take a stand. Not only does it express my views on this awful atrocity, but it also directs anyone who reads my t-shirt to your site, where they can find tons of useful resources concerning the case against abortion. I have even seen several other students on campus sporting Abort73 attire, which makes me smile. I strongly believe in life and would love to see abortion brought to an end. Your company has given me the opportunity to play a part in history as we continue to fight for those lives that cannot stand up for themselves. Age: 20-24

I used to think it was a woman's choice, but now I see that an unborn child is a real person & it's just as wrong to kill them as anyone else. It's so clear to me now how wrong & devastating abortion is that I can't believe I ever felt differently. Age: 20-24

I have learned a great deal about the different types of contraceptive use, namely which ones would be considered abortifacient and which ones are not. I came across this information at a crucial time, particularly since I was getting married within a few months at the time. After much discussion and struggle with the issue, we decided no to use any of the various forms of the pill/patch etc. Thank you abort73 for your helpful information! Age: 25-29

I realized that abortion is such a bigger issue than I originally thought. I was under the impression that it really didn't happen that much. Since coming to this website I have seen how huge the abortion industry really is - and how many people actually agree with it. My thinking of abortion has changed because I realized that it's not enough to say I disagree with it, I must be willing to do something about it. Age: 18-19

As I have been involved more with Abort73 I have realized how many people are in the dark about the truth behind what abortion really is. I've developed a better approach to talking about abortion wherever I am. And developed a desire to be more actively supporting the website and speaking the truth about abortion. Age: 20-24

Great layout. I like that [Abort73] only deals with the facts of abortion on the main page, but allows people who are familiar with the arguments to navigate easily to other pages (the store, the blog, etc.). Your method is genius and I'm glad you're doing the work that you are! Age: 19

Before finding out about this site from a friend of mine wearing one of the t-shirts, I considered my self to be Pro-Choice. Now that I have seen the videos and read many of the articles, I can happily say that I am Pro-Life. I have always loved babies, and the thought of murdering them (for any reason at all) tears me up. Thank you so much for your beautiful and inspiring website, it has helped me tremendously in my decision to become Pro-Life. I am hopefully going to order a t-shirt or two (or three or four) soon!

I have always been pro-life, but abortion was never something that bothered me much and I didn't know why. I cared deeply about the poor, the oppressed, slaves, persecuted Christians - everything except for the unborn and I didn't know why. Then I saw the video on Abort73.com's home page and I realized that I hadn't cared before because I hadn't SEEN abortion. I'd seen poverty, starvation, slavery, persecution, but I'd never seen abortion. That video has literally changed my life. I now view abortion as one of the greatest tragedies in the world today and I've got all these ideas in my head for how I might be able to make a difference. So I just wanted to thank you for creating Abort73. It's the best and most comprehensive abortion resource I know of. Age: 23
