How does family size impact my insurance cost?
Individual versus family plans



An individual plan has one member, or just one person covered by the plan. Family plans cover two or more members.

Your plan's deductible and out-of-pocket maximum are based on whether you have an individual or family plan.

The deductible and out-of-pocket maximum for a family plan is usually double of an individual plan. So if the deductible for a plan is $2,000 for a family, it's $1,000 for an individual. If the out-of-pocket maximum for an individual plan is $6,000, it will be $12,000 for a family, no matter how many people the plan covers.
