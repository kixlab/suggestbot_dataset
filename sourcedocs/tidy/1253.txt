Employers to spend about $10,000 on health care for each worker
Employees at big companies should be prepared to pay 5 percent more for their health care next year. New results from an industry organization's annual study shows that large employers expect the total average per-employee cost for health insurance benefits — which includes premiums and out-of-pocket costs for employees and dependents — to rise in 2018 to $14,156 from $13,482 this year. With employers covering about 70 percent of that cost, the average worker will pay 30 percent of the tab, or about $4,200.

"I think you'll see [the 5 percent rise] in premium increases," said Brian Marcotte, president and CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based National Business Group on Health, which released the study this week. "Most people will probably see minimal changes to deductibles and co-pays unless they move to a [higher-deductible] plan." This marks the fifth consecutive year that health care costs are expected to rise by 5 percent, according to the study. That outpaces the rate of inflation, which was 2.54 percent in 2016 and 2 percent for the first half of 2017. Workers' salaries also aren't rising as quickly as health care costs. The most recent data from the Federal Reserve shows that wages are growing by 3.2 percent annually.

It shows that employers rank the cost of "specialty pharmaceuticals" as the top driver of cost increases, which is unchanged from last year's survey results. Basically, new treatments for specific conditions ranging from diabetes and asthma to hemophilia and immune disorders can come with hefty price tags. "There's a rich pipeline of specialty medicines," Marcotte said. "They can be thousands or tens of thousands of dollars per treatment."
