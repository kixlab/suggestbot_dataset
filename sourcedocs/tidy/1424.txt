Geography of Iraq
Most of Iraq is a series of broad, sandy plains. The Syrian Desert blankets the land in the extreme west. In the southeast near the Persian Gulf, the land is low, marshy, and often flooded.

Iraq is mountainous in the north, as the Zagros Mountains front its borders with Iran and Turkey. The country's highest point is located there, an unnamed peak rising 11,847 ft (3,611 m).

Two of the most significant rivers in all of Asia, the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, drain the land.
