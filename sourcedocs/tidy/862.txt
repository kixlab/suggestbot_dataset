Data — IPCC
TG-Data aims to provide guidance to the Data Distribution Centre (DDC) on curation, traceability, stability, availability and transparency of data and scenarios related to the reports of the IPCC. Together with the DDC, the Task Group facilitates the availability and consistent use of climate change-related data and scenarios in support of the implementation of the IPCC’s programme of work.

TG-Data replaces the Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Analysis (TGICA) whose mandate was to facilitate the distribution and application of climate change related data and scenarios to enable research and sharing of information across the three IPCC Working Groups.

At its 47th Session on 13-16 March 2018, the IPCC adopted Decision IPCC-XLVII-9 where TGICA was renamed to Task Group on Data Support for Climate Change Assessments (TG-Data) with new Terms of Reference for TG-Data as well as Guidance for the Data Distribution Centre (DDC).
