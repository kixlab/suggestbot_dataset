Working While Pregnant: How to Handle It Like a Boss
If you have "morning sickness" (and up to 85 percent of pregnant women do â€” though not necessarily only in the A.M.), the best advice is to eat, eat, eat.

"Constantly snacking kept my queasiness at bay, so I kept Kashi bars and Goldfish in the pockets of my white coat all the time," says Lindsay Mazotti, MD, a physician in San Francisco. Small, healthy snacks throughout the day can keep your blood sugar steady and curb nausea. Many women find that ginger ale, gingersnaps, or lemon drops are helpful, too, says Dr. Greenfield. Just in case, grab a seat by the door during meetings so you can make a quick exit if you start to feel nauseated. If your symptoms are really severe, consider asking your doctor about medication.

Your biggest challenge will probably be fighting fatigue. "When I was pregnant with my twins, I was so exhausted that once I snuck a nap in the supply closet," says Jane Roper, an advertising copywriter in Boston. To boost your energy, get moving. A brisk walk at lunchtime can do wonders, says Nancy W. Hall, PhD, author of Balancing Pregnancy and Work. And something as simple as chewing mint-flavored gum is instantly refreshing. Try getting to bed a little earlier too.

To deal with lack of focus ("pregnancy brain"), take copious notes and use "cheat sheets." Do your most challenging tasks first thing when you get to work or when you're feeling your best. Say no to requests to take on extra duties until you see how you are handling the basics, and use your e-mail's calendar program to keep track of appointments and meetings.
