Rising Global Temperatures and CO2
Rising Global Temperatures and CO2

By Climate Central

In 1895, Svante Arrhenius first calculated the impact that increasing carbon dioxide could have on Earth’s temperature. Since then, scientists have further refined their understanding of the greenhouse effect and the role our rising carbon emissions are having on it.

Chief among the impacts of our emissions is the rise in the global temperature. That’s why countries around the world have agreed to limitthat warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures.
