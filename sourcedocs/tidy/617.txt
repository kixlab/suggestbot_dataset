Science Advisory Board > Home




NOAAâ€™s Science Advisory Board (SAB) was established by a Decision Memorandum dated September 25, 1997. It is the only Federal Advisory Committee with responsibility to advise the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere on long- and short-range strategies for research, education and the application of science to resource management and environmental assessment and prediction.

SAB activities and advice provide necessary input to ensure that National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) science programs are of the highest quality and provide optimal support to resource management, and environmental assessment and prediction. The advisory board assists NOAA in maintaining a complete and accurate understanding of scientific issues critical to the agency's missions.

Composed of eminent scientists, engineers, resource managers and educators, the diverse membership of the Board assures expertise reflecting the full breadth of NOAA's responsibilities, as well as the ethnic and gender diversity of the United States. Members are appointed by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and NOAA Administrator.
