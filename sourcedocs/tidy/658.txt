Helping Internationally
Local Actions Have International Impact

The American Red Cross responds to international disasters by sending financial assistance, pre-positioned relief supplies from our global warehouses, trained emergency response personnel, or any combination of the three.

Not all disasters overseas require our assistance. Even large disasters that dominate the news can often be managed by that countryâ€™s Red Cross or Red Crescent organization. For example, Indonesia experiences frequent intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions; as a result, the Indonesian Red Cross has the experience and capacity to handle most of their disaster operations without outside support. Local Red Cross organizations only request assistance when a disaster exceeds their capacity to respond.

And the Red Cross help is not limited to disaster relief; we do other types of humanitarian work with a global impact as well. There are many opportunities for you to get involved, through donating, taking or teaching a class, or volunteering.
