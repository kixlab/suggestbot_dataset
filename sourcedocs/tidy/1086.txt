How much does a weed dealer make?
From a growers perspective..

You don't make much but it's better than working behind a desk 40 hours a week.

I grow about 40 pounds a year. Pretty small time. All outdoors so no electricity bills or fancy expensive hardware. Just sun and water and soil.

It cost me about $2000 a year in materials (new pots, netting, fertilizer, amendments, poles, etc.) to produce that amount.

My options to move it are limited. Basically I can try and sell it myself or I can sell it to a wholesale broker. Unless you know people who smoke a lot, like an ounce a week or more, it's really hard to sell that much weed in grams and eighths.

I can take it to dispensaries and try and sell it to them, but that's a pain in the ass because it requires testing results (cheap, but time consuming to get) and then it's usally a consignment deal where I have to wait 30 days to get paid (which really sucks) and they don't pay much more only like $1500 to $2000 a pound. But there is also a shit load of competition and many of them will undercut my pricing because they produce a lot more and can afford to take $1250 a pound.

The broker pays $1000 a pound. That's pretty low. But he will take most or all of it in go, which is an advantage.

I also turn all the trim and any small nugs that don't sell into concentrates. Try not to waste anything and maximize potential income. But even concentrate is hard to sell in bulk.

The thing is that with legalization and recreationally available weed the prices will only go down. It will get harder to make a living doing this. But it's what I've chosen and I can adapt and I can expand and change whatever I need to do to stay profitable.
