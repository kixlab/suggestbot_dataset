Primary Care at Planned Parenthood
What is Primary Care?

Primary care is a term describing basic health care services that an individual might need for general health concerns. A primary care provider is often the first doctor a patient might see for such issues. A patient may be referred to a specialist (another type of doctor) for more complicated health conditions.
