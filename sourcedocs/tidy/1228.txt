Are prescription drug costs out of control?
News stories frequently suggest that prescription drug costs are “skyrocketing.” But the reality that’s reflected across the country is quite different than the one portrayed in most media reports, which typically focus on isolated examples.

In fact, prescription drugs costs — both the prices for drugs and how much money society spends on medicines — have been remarkably stable in recent years. Starting with spending on prescription drugs:

According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or CMS, national spending on retail prescription drugs grew just 0.4% percent in 2017. The growth in drug spending was slower than the spending growth for hospital services (4.6%), physician services (4.2%) and overall health care expenditures (3.8%). i

IQVIA — a nonpartisan health care data analytics firm— reports that national spending on all prescription drugs increased less than 1 percent in 2017. Additionally, they note that spending on retail and mail-order pharmacies decreased by 2.1 percent.ii

A similar trend exists when it comes drug prices.

The same report by IQVIA found that the average net price for brand-name drugs grew less than 2 percent in 2017. The net price is after factoring in discounts and rebates offered by drugmakers, which in 2017, reached an estimated $153 billion.iii

The data clearly show that the trend on prescription drug costs is not as dire as some argue. This positive trend also been reaffirmed by pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs). These drug cost middlemen manage drug benefits on behalf of health plans, and some of the nation’s leading PBMs have reported very little change in drug prices for commercial health plans in 2017.iv
