Each Country's Share of CO2 Emissions
En español: Las emisiones de dióxido de carbono por país The world’s countries emit vastly different amounts of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. The table below shows data compiled by the International Energy Agency, which estimates carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of coal, natural gas, oil and other fuels, including industrial waste and non-renewable municipal waste.

Here we list the 20 countries that emitted the most carbon dioxide in 2015 (the most recent available data).

2015 total emissions country rank Country 2015 total carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion (million metric tons) 2015 per capita carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion (metric tons) 1 China 9040.74 6.59 2 United States 4997.50 15.53 3 India 2066.01 1.58 4 Russia 1468.99 10.19 5 Japan 1141.58 8.99 6 Germany 729.77 8.93 7 South Korea 585.99 11.58 8 Iran 552.40 6.98 9 Canada 549.23 15.32 10 Saudi Arabia 531.46 16.85 11 Brazil 450.79 2.17 12 Mexico 442.31 3.66 13 Indonesia 441.91 1.72 14 South Africa 427.57 7.77 15 United Kingdom 389.75 5.99 16 Australia 380.93 15.83 17 Italy 330.75 5.45 18 Turkey 317.22 4.10 19 France 290.49 4.37 20 Poland 282.40 7.34

The picture that emerges from these figures is one where—in general—developed countries and major emerging economy nations lead in total carbon dioxide emissions. Developed nations typically have high carbon dioxide emissions per capita, while some developing countries lead in the growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions. Obviously, these uneven contributions to the climate problem are at the core of the challenges the world community faces in finding effective and equitable solutions.
