10 myths about climate change
1. "CO2 is not a pollutant. It’s a GREEN gas which plants, crops and trees need to grow."

This is true, but in the context of climate change, this is misinformed.

Yes, plants need carbon dioxide (CO2) for photosynthesis as humans need oxygen for respiration. In fact, the world’s forests store and cycle huge amounts of carbon. However, there’s a limit to the amount that they can be stored in any given woodland area, and with deforestation increasing this limit is getting lower. CO2 itself does not cause problems; it is part of the natural global ecosystem. The problem is caused by the quantity being released by human activity: there hasn’t been this level of CO2 in the atmosphere for 800,000 years.

Our carbon emissions are contributing to the greenhouse effect – trapping heat and making the Earth warmer.
