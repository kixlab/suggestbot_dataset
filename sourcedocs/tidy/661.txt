] The formula for degrees Celsius is: C = 5\9 (F � 32), where F stands for degrees Fahrenheit. Part 1: Solve the formula for F. Show all steps. Part 2: Determine how many degrees Fahrenheit 6 degrees Celsius is.

Part 1: Solve the formula for F. Show all steps.

C = 5/9 (F � 32)

9C = 5(F - 32)

F - 32 = 9C/5

F = 9C/5 + 32

--------------

Part 2: Determine how many degrees Fahrenheit 6 degrees Celsius is.

F = 9*6/5 + 32

F = 54/5 + 32

F = 10.8 + 32

F = 42.8

-----------------------

To convert "in your head":

Add 40

If converting from C to F, multiply by 1.8

If converting from F to C, divide by 1.8

Subtract 40

-------------

eg from 25C to F

Add 40 --> 65

Multiply by 9/5 --? 585/5 = 117

Subtract 40 --> 77F
