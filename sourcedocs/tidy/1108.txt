Looney said he would like to see Connecticut follow the Colorado model, which assess a 15 percent excise tax on the average market rate of retail marijuana. "Colorado has the most aggressive tax structure and that’s the one I’d like to see us follow,'' he said. “New York will be in the market very soon so we have to look at what level of taxation there is on our borders.”
