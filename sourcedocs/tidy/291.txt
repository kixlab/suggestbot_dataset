Why do we debate? Is there a point to it?
Simple answer = Because people will always disagree.

Debate is just a more formal way to disagree. Because it has rules and structure it takes out much of the emotion in an argument or verbal fight. This allows us to evaluate the merits of the claims more objectively and to come to a better decision. Given that both sides want to “win” it encourages them to find supporting research, experts in that field, or create examples that show the logic (or illogic of their opponents) of the position.

So we need debate to teach us how to find the strongest points for our position. We need debate to teach us how to research topics. We need debate to teach us how to structure a position so that it’s organized and flows and that an audience can understand it. We need debate to teach us the tricks that other people use against us to get emotion responses. To see the gaps in logic they present. To learn how to evaluate the supporting information of their claims to see if it truly supports their position.

Every time you go for a job interview, go for a raise, make a life changing decision, argue with your significant other, evaluate a politician’s speech, or any of the hundreds of other things that impact your life you need debate skills. Communication is the bedrock of our society and it’s worth your time to learn to have better skills at evaluating it.
