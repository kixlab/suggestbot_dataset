Did the Great Wall of China do more harm for China than good?
It did protect China from the Mongolians and other enemies for centuries. The beginnings of it were started by the Emperor Qin 2200 years ago and it wasn’t until the 1600s that it was breached.

Many lives were lost building some of the early great projects of the US, such as Hoover Dam and the Panama Canal. These still serve critical needs to the present day.

But the Great Wall serves a great purpose today; in the entire history of the human race, there are only two ultimate icons of human construction that, more than any other, define our species and it’s accomplishments, and I have posted photos of both here (taken in 2014 and 2017, respectively).

Oh, and both bring tourism and fame to those countries from around the world and always will.
