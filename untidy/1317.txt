countries-800x600.png)  
According to a recent publication from the **Commonwealth Fund** , The USA is
ranked last out of 11 Countries.

"Among the 11 nations studied in this report - Australia, Canada, France,
Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom, and the United States—the U.S. ranks last, as it did in 2010, 2007,
2006, and 2014″

They go on to report on each country:

"Most troubling, the U.S. fails to achieve better health outcomes than the
other countries, and as shown in the earlier editions, the U.S. is last or
near last on dimensions of access, efficiency, and equity."

You can read the full report here: Commonwealth Fund Report

    
            Update. According to 2017, the USA still ranks 11th:
    

### Health Care System Performance Rankings

systems](https://cdn.internationalinsurance.com/wp-

Source: Commonwealth Fund analysis

> **Key findings:** The U.S. ranked last on performance overall and ranked
last or near last on the Access, Administrative Efficiency, Equity, and Health
Care Outcomes domains. The top-ranked countries overall were the U.K.,
Australia, and the Netherlands. Based on a broad range of indicators, the U.S.
health system is an outlier, spending far more but falling short of the
performance achieved by other high-income countries. The results suggest the
U.S. health care system should look at other countries ' approaches if it
wants to achieve an affordable high-performing health care system that serves
all Americans.
