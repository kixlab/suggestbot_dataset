### Immigration attorney represented 3-year-old

(CNN) The agony and desperation are written all over migrants' faces. But what
you can't see is how bad their homelands really are.

For decades, US officials have vetted who should get asylum -- a protected
status that allows people fleeing persecution to live legally in another
country.

But the odds of gaining asylum just got a lot tougher. Under a new Trump
administration policy, those claiming a fear of domestic violence or non-
governmental gang violence will be immediately rejected.

And that's a huge blow to the many asylum seekers fleeing Honduras, El
Salvador and Guatemala. Snapshots of these countries reveal the nightmares
they're trying to escape:

**Population living in poverty:** 60.9%

A Honduran boy and father seeking asylum were taken into custody by US Border
Patrol in June.

**Life in Honduras:** As the second-poorest country in Central America,
Honduras "suffers from extraordinarily unequal distribution of income" and
rampant underemployment, the CIA World Factbook says.

Widespread gang violence fuels instability and suffering. Criminals have
extorted Hondurans into paying an arbitrary "war tax" for their survival, and
those who can't pay often are killed.

Honduran police hold a boy whose father was killed in 2016 by alleged gang
members for refusing to pay them a "war tax."

"There are no jobs, no justice, no laws in Honduras," said 32-year-old Karen
Gallo, who sought asylum this year with a caravan of migrants.

Some of those migrants were transgender people who faced persecution in
Honduras. Nikolle Contreras said she suffered "discrimination because of my
sexuality, lack of work, discrimination within my own family for being gay and
worse, for being a trans person."

Salvadorans brace for their worst nightmare 02:47

**Gross national income, per capita:** $3,920

**Population below poverty line:** 38.2%

**Life in El Salvador:** "El Salvador is beset by one of the world's highest
homicide rates and pervasive criminal gangs," the CIA World Factbook says.

One 38-year-old migrant said she understands not everyone would welcome her to
the United States.

"But I don't have an option," she told CNN. "If I stay in El Salvador, I'm
going to be killed."

In recent decades, poor economic conditions and natural disasters also have
contributed to Salvadorans fleeing to the United States.

### Guatemala

**Gross national income, per capita:** $3,790

**Population below poverty line:** 59.3%

Guatemalan man: We had to use machetes to stop rapes, kidnappings and killings

**Life in Guatemala** : Almost half of Guatemalan children under age 5 are
chronically malnourished -- "one of the highest malnutrition rates in the
world," the CIA World Factbook says.

"Guatemalans have a history of emigrating legally and illegally to Mexico, the
United States and Canada because of a lack of economic opportunity, political
instability and natural disasters."

An undocumented immigrant from Guatemala who came to the US illegally wears a
GPS ankle monitor.

More than half of the country lives in poverty, and 23% lives in extreme
poverty -- meaning people survive on less than $1.25 a day.

CNN's Tal Kopan, Leyla Santiago and Khushbu Shah contributed to this report.
