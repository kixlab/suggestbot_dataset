>> # How Does Carbon Dioxide Affect the Environment?

>> Carbon dioxide is essential to the survival of plants and animals. Too
much, however, can cause all life on Earth to die. Not only do plants and
animals need to ingest carbon dioxide, but they also rely on the gas to keep
them warm, as it is an essential component to Earth's atmosphere.

>>

>> #### TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

>>

>> Carbon dioxide plays a key role in plant life and helps keep the earth
warm. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, though, are
linked to global warming.

>>

>> ## Greenhouse Gas

>>

>> Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring greenhouse gas. Others include
water vapor, methane and nitrous oxide. These gases help keep the Earth warm
by absorbing the sun's energy and by redirecting energy back to the Earth's
surface. An increase in the amount of carbon dioxide creates an overabundance
of greenhouse gases that trap additional heat. This trapped heat leads to
melting ice caps and rising ocean levels, which cause flooding.

>>

>> ## Plants

>>

>> Plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in a process called carbon
sequestration. The carbon dioxide is stored in biomass then released by the
plant. In most cases, the amount released is less than the amount consumed by
the plant. Farms, grasslands and forests are considered sources or sinks of
carbon dioxide, depending on the practices on these lands. For example, cows
produce methane, but grass on the farm sequesters the gas.

>> ## Health

>>

>> Carbon dioxide is essential for the survival of animals. Oxygen is carried
to body tissue during breathing and carbon dioxide is released. The gas
protects the pH level of blood. Too much carbon dioxide, however, can kill
animals. If carbon dioxide is confined, it can decrease the amount of oxygen
reaching the body. Any increase or decrease to the amount of carbon dioxide
reaching the body can lead to kidney failure or coma.

>>

>> ## Sources

>>

>> Combustible fossil fuels such as coal, power plant gas, oil, vehicles and
big industry are the largest source of carbon dioxide. The production is from
various items such as iron, steel, cement, natural gas, solid waste
combustion, lime, ammonia, limestone, cropland, soda ash, aluminum,
petrochemical, titanium and phosphoric acid. Carbon dioxide accounts for
nearly 85 percent of all emissions and is produced when natural gas, petroleum
and coal are used. The major areas where these fuels are used include
electricity generation, transportation, industry and in residential and
commercial buildings.
