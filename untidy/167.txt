**The Libertarian Case Against Abortion**

**One popular misconception is that libertarianism as a political principle
supports choice on abortion. And major elements within the libertarian
movement (the Libertarian Party, for example) take abortion-choice stands.
Nonetheless, libertarianism's basic principle is that each of us has the
obligation not to aggress against (violate the rights of) anyone else -- for
any reason (personal, social, or political), however worthy. That is a clearly
pro-life principle. Recognizing that, and seeing the abortion-choice drift
within the libertarian movement, Libertarians for Life was founded in 1976 to
show why abortion is a wrong under justice, not a right.**

**We see our mission as presenting the pro-life case to libertarians and the
libertarian case to pro-lifers. Among supporters of LFL, some of us are
members of the Libertarian Party, some are not. Some are religious, some are
not. (Doris Gordon, our Founder and Coordinator, is a Jewish atheist.) Our
reasoning is expressly scientific and philosophical rather than either
pragmatic or religious, or merely political or emotional.**

**To explain and defend our case, LFL argues that:

    1. Human offspring are human beings, persons from conception, whether that takes place as natural or artificial fertilization, by cloning, or by any other means. 

    2. Abortion is homicide -- the killing of one person by another. 

    3. One's right to control one's own body does not allow violating the obligation not to aggress. There is never a right to kill an innocent person. Prenatally, we are all innocent persons. 

    4. A prenatal child has the right to be in the mother's body. Parents have no right to evict their children from the crib or from the womb and let them die. Instead both parents, the father as well as the mother, owe them support and protection from harm. 

    5. No government, nor any individual, has a just power to legally "de-person" any one of us, born or preborn. 

    6. The proper purpose of the law is to side with the innocent, not against them. 

For more, please read LFL's literature in the Library.**
