  * Estimated Federal Drug Control Spending By Function for Fiscal Years 2003-2017

**1.** Federal Drug Control Spending by Function FY2013 through FY2018 (Un-
Adjusted)

The combined federal drug control budget request for Fiscal Year 2018 is
$27.57 billion, up from $23.8 billion in 2013.

Click here for complete datatable for Federal Drug Control Spending by
Function FY2013 through FY2018 as estimated by the Office of National Drug
Control Policy.

ONDCP changed its method of accounting for treatment spending in its FY2018
report. According to footnote two for table two, p. 18, in the FY2018 budget
report: "The estimates for the CMS [Centers or Medicare and Medicaid Services]
reflect Medicaid and Medicare benefit outlays (excluding spending under
Medicare Part D) for substance use disorder treatment; they do not reflect
budget authority. The methodology for Medicaid estimates has been refined from
prior years to more accurately reflect spending. The estimates were developed
by the CMS Office of the Actuary." Questions have arisen regarding this
decision, so in order to provide a better understanding of these figures,
click here for a complete datatable of Federal Drug Control Spending by
Function FY2008 through FY2016 and the request for FY2017 as estimated by
ONDCP in December 2016.

The FY2017 budget report from ONDCP, which was issued in early January 2017,
showed the following final figures for FY2015:  
Treatment: $12.54 billion (43.4% of total)  
Prevention: $1.34 billion (4.6% of total)  
Domestic Law Enforcement: $9.4 billion (32.5% of total)  
Interdiction: $3.96 billion (13.7% of total)  
International: $1.64 billion (5.7% of total)  
Total: $28.88 billion

The FY2018 budget report from ONDCP, which was issued in May 2017, shows the
following final figures for FY2015:  
Treatment: $9.55 billion (36.9% of total)  
Prevention: $1.34 billion (5.2% of total)  
Domestic Law Enforcement: $9.4 billion (36.3% of total)  
Interdiction: $3.96 billion (15.3% of total)  
International: $1.64 billion (6.3% of total)  
Total: $25.89 billion

FY2016 figures were also adjusted:  
According to the FY2017 Budget Report  
2016 Enacted:  
Treatment: $13.25 billion (43.4%)  
Prevention: $1.5 billion (4.9%)  
Domestic Law Enforcement: $9.7 billion (31.7%)  
Interdiction: $4.48 billion (14.7%)  
International: $1.64 billion (5.4%)  
Total: $30.56 billion

However according to the FY2018 report:  
FY2016 Final:  
Treatment: $9.85 billion (36.6% of total)  
Prevention: $1.49 billion (5.5% of total)  
Domestic Law Enforcement: $9.28 billion (34.5% of total)  
Interdiction: $4.73 billion (17.6% of total)  
International: $1.52 billion (5.7% of total)  
Total: $26.87 billion

**2.** FY2018 Federal Drug Control Budget Request

"The President’s FY 2018 Budget Request supports $27.8 billion for drug
control efforts spanning prevention, treatment, interdiction, international
operations, and law enforcement across 14 Executive Branch departments, the
Federal Judiciary, and the District of Columbia. This represents an increase
of $279.7 million (1.0 percent) over the annualized Continuing Resolution (CR)
level in FY 2017 of $27.5 billion. Within this total, the Budget supports $1.3
billion in investments authorized by the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery
Act (CARA) the 21st Century Cures Act, and other opioid-specific programs to
help address the opioid epidemic."

**3.** Estimated Economic Impact of Illegal Opioid Use and Opioid-Related
Overdose Deaths

The White House Council of Economic Advisers [CEA] released its analysis of
the economic costs of illegal opioid use, related overdoses, and overdose
mortality in November 2017. It reported a dramatically higher estimate than
previous analyses, largely due to a change in methodology. Previous analyses
had used a person's estimated lifetime earnings to place a dollar value on
that person's life. According to the CEA, "We diverge from the previous
literature by quantifying the costs of opioid-related overdose deaths based on
economic valuations of fatality risk reduction, the “value of a statistical
life” (VSL)."

The CEA noted that "According to a recent white paper prepared by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Policy for review by the
EPA’s Science Advisory Board (U.S. EPA 2016), the EPA’s current guidance calls
for using a VSL estimate of $10.1 million (in 2015 dollars), updated from
earlier estimates based on inflation, income growth, and assumed income
elasticities. Guidance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) suggests using the range of estimates from Robinson and Hammitt (2016)
referenced earlier, ranging from a low of $4.4 million to a high of $14.3
million with a central value of $9.4 million (in 2015 dollars). The central
estimates used by these three agencies, DOT, EPA, and HHS, range from a low of
$9.4 million (HHS) to a high of $10.1 million (EPA) (in 2015 dollars)."

In addition, the CEA assumed that the number of opioid-related overdoses in
the US in 2015 was significantly under-reported. According to its report,
"However, recent research has found that opioids are underreported on death
certificates. Ruhm (2017) estimates that in 2014, opioid-involved overdose
deaths were 24 percent higher than officially reported.4 We apply this
adjustment to the 2015 data, resulting in an estimated 41,033 overdose deaths
involving opioids. We apply this adjustment uniformly over the age
distribution of fatalities."

The combination of that assumption with the methodology change resulted in a
dramatically higher cost estimate than previous research had shows. According
to the CEA, "CEA’s preferred cost estimate of $504.0 billion far exceeds
estimates published elsewhere. Table 3 shows the cost estimates from several
past studies of the cost of the opioid crisis, along with the ratio of the CEA
estimate to each study’s estimate in 2015 dollars. Compared to the recent
Florence et al. (2016) study—which estimated the cost of prescription opioid
abuse in 2013—CEA’s preferred estimate is more than six times higher, reported
in the table’s last column as the ratio of $504.0 billion to $79.9 billion,
which is Florence et al.’s estimate adjusted to 2015 dollars. Even CEA’s low
total cost estimate of $293.9 billion is 3.7 times higher than Florence et
al.’s estimate."

In contrast, the CEA noted that "Among the most recent (and largest) estimates
was that produced by Florence et al. (2016), who estimated that prescription
opioid overdose, abuse, and dependence in the United States in 2013 cost $78.5
billion. The authors found that 73 percent of this cost was attributed to
nonfatal consequences, including healthcare spending, criminal justice costs
and lost productivity due to addiction and incarceration. The remaining 27
percent was attributed to fatality costs consisting almost entirely of lost
potential earnings." According to the CDC, there were 25,840 deaths in 2013
related to an opioid overdose.

According to the CEA, "We also present cost estimates under three alternative
VSL assumptions without age-adjustment: low ($5.4 million), middle ($9.6
million), and high ($13.4 million), values suggested by the U.S. DOT and
similar to those used by HHS. For example, our low fatality cost estimate of
$221.6 billion is the product of the adjusted number of fatalities, 41,033,
and the VSL assumption of $5.4 million. Our fatality cost estimates thus range
from a low of $221.6 billion to a high of $549.8 billion."

**4.** Estimated Cost Savings for Treatment vs. Law Enforcement

"This study found that the savings of supply-control programs are smaller than
the control costs (an estimated 15 cents on the dollar for source-country
control, 32 cents on the dollar for interdiction, and 52 cents on the dollar
for domestic enforcement). In contrast, the savings of treatment programs are
larger than the control costs; we estimate that the costs of crime and lost
productivity are reduced by $7.46 for every dollar spend on treatment."

**6.** Estimated Savings and Added Revenue from Drug Legalization

"This report estimates that legalizing drugs would save roughly $41.3 billion
per year in government expenditure on enforcement of prohibition. Of these
savings, $25.7 billion would accrue to state and local governments, while
$15.6 billion would accrue to the federal government. Approximately $8.7
billion of the savings would result from legalization of marijuana and $32.6
billion from legalization of other drugs.  
"The report also estimates that drug legalization would yield tax revenue of
$46.7 billion annually, assuming legal drugs were taxed at rates comparable to
those on alcohol and tobacco. Approximately $8.7 billion of this revenue would
result from legalization of marijuana and $38.0 billion from legalization of
other drugs."

Prohibition," The Cato Institute (Washington, DC: Cato Institute, 2010).

**7.** Inherent Limitations of Drug Production and Consumption Estimates

"Existing estimates about drug production and consumption are cryptic,
inconsistent, and often impossible to verify. Apart from the series of studies
titled What America’s Users Spend on Illegal Drugs that was produced in the
1990s under ONDCP’s auspices (see Rhodes, 1995, and Abt Associates, 2001) and
the 1990s work of the Drug Availability Steering Committee (2002), many of the
most-quoted estimates are not documented in a manner that allows others to
assess their credibility, let alone replicate them. The large year-to-year
changes in official estimates of consumption and particularly of production
reduce their credibility, given the stable data on marijuana use in the U.S.
population over the past decade.  
"While a number of estimates are described as being 'intelligence based' or
are released by intelligence agencies, this does not mean we should
automatically give them high credibility. This paper identifies a number of
these estimates from national and international sources that are simply
implausible. Drug-market estimation is a field plagued by a lack of data and
heavily dependent on assumptions; thus, estimates from both intelligence and
nonintelligence agencies need to be scrutinized. Policymakers would be well
served by preventing the publication of figures without peer review. If the
truth is that these figures are estimated imprecisely, that fact should be
noted."

Marijuana in California Help?" International Programs and Drug Policy Research
Center (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, October 2010), p. 44.  
http://www.rand.org/pubs/occas...

**8.** Estimated Combined Spending by Federal and State Governments to Address
Substance Use

"Federal and state governments spent $3.3 trillion in 2005 to operate
government and provide public services such as education, health care, income
assistance, child welfare, mental health, law enforcement and justice
services, transportation and highway safety. Hidden in this spending was a
stunning $373.9 billion--11.2 percent--that was spent on tobacco, alcohol and
other drug abuse and addiction. A conservative estimate of local government
spending on substance abuse and addiction in 2005 is $93.8 billion.

"The vast majority of federal and state substance related spending--95.6
percent or $357.4 billion--went to carry the burden to government programs of
our failure to prevent and treat the problem while only 1.9 percent was spent
on preventing or treating addiction. Another 0.4 percent was spent on research
and the remaining two percent was spent on alcohol and tobacco tax collection,
regulation and operation of state liquor stores (1.4 percent) federal drug
interdiction (0.7 percent). For every dollar the federal and state governments
spent on prevention and treatment, they spent $59.83 shoveling up the
consequences.

"A staggering 71.1 percent of total federal and state spending on the burden
of addiction is in two areas: health and justice. Almost three fifths (58.0
percent) of federal and state spending on the burden of substance abuse and
addiction (74.1 percent of the federal burden) is in the area of health care
where untreated addiction causes or contributes to over 70 other diseases
requiring hospitalization. The second largest area of substance-related
federal and state burden spending is the justice system (13.1 percent)."

**9.** Alcohol and Tobacco Use are Responsible for Most Substance-Related
Spending by Federal and State Governments

"Almost half (47.3 percent) of government spending on substance abuse and
addiction cannot be disaggregated by substance. In fact, research shows that
most individuals who abuse or are dependent on addictive substances use more
than one drug.9 Of the $248 billion in substance-related spending that can be
linked to specific drugs of abuse, 92.3 percent is linked to the legal drugs
of alcohol and tobacco."

**10.** Total State and Federal Government Spending on Drugs Other Than
Alcohol or Tobacco in 2005

"Total government spending as a consequence of other drug use that can be
differentiated by substance is an estimated $18.7 billion:  
" $16.4 billion in federal spending: $7.8 billion in dedicated drug
enforcement, $39.5 million in drug court costs, $2.6 billion for drug
interdiction, $2.5 billion for prevention, treatment, research and evaluation,
and $3.8 billion in health care costs.  
" $1.9 billion in state spending: $336 million for public safety costs for
drug enforcement programs, $138 million for drug courts, and $1.5 million
linked to illicit and controlled prescription drugs in state spending on
Medicaid.  
" $342.3 million in local health care spending."

**11.** Reported Educational Achievement and Income of Drug Using Versus Non-
Using Full-Time Workers

" Workers with a college education had a lower prevalence of current illicit
drug use compared with those without a college education. The prevalence of
past month use of illicit drugs was lower among those with higher levels of
education than those with less education (college graduate [5.7 percent] vs.
less than high school [11.2 percent]) (Figure 2.6 and Table 2.3).  
" The prevalence of current illicit drug use was lower among workers with
higher family incomes than among workers with lower family incomes. An
estimated 13.2 percent of workers who reported family income that was less
than $20,000 had used illicit drugs during the past month. In contrast, 6.0
percent of workers who reported income in the highest category––$75,000 or
more––had used illicit drugs during the past month (Figure 2.7 and Table 2.3).  
" Residents of noncore counties had a lower prevalence of current illicit
drug use (4.5 to 6.2 percent) compared with residents of micropolitan
statistical area (7.1 percent), small metropolitan statistical area (MSA; 8.8
percent), and large MSA (8.3 percent) counties (Table 2.3)."

Health Services Administration, Office of Applied Studies, pp. 12-15.

**12.** Estimated Value of US Methamphetamine Market

"A more recent study using a demand-side approach estimates that the annual
retail value of the U.S. methamphetamine market is between $3 and $8 billion,
with a best guess of $5 billion.12 The margin of error is large because the
footprint of methamphetamine use does not match the footprint of the data
collection system. Methamphetamine use in the United States is concentrated in
certain regions, and it is not primarily an urban drug, whereas data
collection systems are centered in urban areas. Moreover, because there have
been dramatic shifts in methamphetamine consumption and production during the
past decade, estimates are highly dependent on the year analyzed. While there
are considerable uncertainties, the amphetamine market is clearly smaller than
the cocaine and cannabis markets in North America, smaller than the cocaine
market in South America, and potentially smaller than markets for other drugs
elsewhere in the hemisphere as well. However, data are not available to
provide a detailed analysis for all regions."

**13.** Effectiveness of Interdiction Spending

"In 2005, the federal government spent $2.6 billion to disrupt and deter the
transport of illicit drugs into the United States. While international efforts
to step up drug seizures may affect availability, price and consequences
associated with a particular drug (i.e., cocaine or heroin), CASA was unable
to find evidence that such strategies have an overall impact on reducing
substance abuse and addiction or its costs to government."

NY: CASA, May 2009), p. 58.  
http://www.casacolumbia.org/ad...

**14.** Official Estimate of What Americans Spend on Drugs, 2010

" Drug users in the United States spend on the order of $100 billion annually
on cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and meth. While this total figure has been
stable over the decade, there have been important compositional shifts. In
2000, much more money was spent on cocaine than marijuana; in 2010 the
opposite was true.  
" From 2002 to 2010, the amount of marijuana consumed in the United States
likely increased by about 40 percent while the amount of cocaine consumed in
the United States decreased by about 50 percent. These figures are consistent
with supply-side indicators, such as  
seizures and production estimates.  
" Heroin consumption remained fairly stable throughout the decade, although
there is some evidence of an increase in the later years. Most of the heroin
consumed in the United States comes from poppies grown in Colombia and Mexico,
but data deficiencies surrounding associated production figures from 2005 to
2010 make comparisons difficult. There was a steady increase in the amount of
heroin seized within the United States and at the southwest border from 2007
through 2010.  
" Methamphetamine estimates are subject to the greatest uncertainty because
national datasets do not do a good job of capturing its use. Three particular
challenges were that the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM-I) was
discontinued in 2003, just before meth use was believed to be at its peak
(2004–2006); ADAM-II did not start until 2007 (2007–2010) and it covers very
few counties with substantial meth use; and the National Survey on Drug Use
and Health (NSDUH) changed how it asked about meth use in 2007. While multiple
indicators are consistent with an increasing trend in meth consumption over
the first half of the decade and a subsequent decline through 2008, there is
not comparable agreement as to the level. Further, we suggest that the most
defensible position concerning trends from 2008 to 2010 is simply to admit the
data are insufficient to provide clear guidance.  
" For all of the drugs, total consumption and expenditures are driven by the
minority of heavy users, who consume on 21 or more days each month."

**15.** Cost of Controlled Prescription Drug (CPD) Diversion

"Moreover, the estimated cost of CPD diversion and abuse to public and private
medical insurers is $72.5 billion a year,3 much of which is passed to
consumers through higher health insurance premiums. Additionally, the abuse of
prescription opioids is burdening the budgets of substance abuse treatment
providers, particularly as prescription opioid abuse might be fueling heroin
abuse rates in some areas of the United States."

**16.** Official Estimate of the Economic Impact of Illicit Drug Use

"In 2007, the cost of illicit drug use totaled more than $193 billion. Direct
and indirect costs attributable to illicit drug use are estimated in three
principal areas: crime, health, and productivity.  
"• Crime includes three components: criminal justice system costs (
_$56,373,254,000_ ), crime victim costs ( _$1,455,555,000_ ), and other crime
costs ( _$3,547,885,000_ ). These subtotal _$61,376,694,000_.  
"• Health includes five components: specialty treatment costs (
_$3,723,338,000_ ), hospital and emergency department costs for nonhomicide
cases ( _$5,684,248,000_ ), hospital and emergency department costs for
homicide cases ( _$12,938,000_ ), insurance administration costs ( _$544,000_
), and other health costs ( _$1,995,164,000_ ). These subtotal
_$11,416,232,000_.  
"• Productivity includes seven components: labor participation costs (
_$49,237,777,000_ ), specialty treatment costs for services provided at the
state level ( _$2,828,207,000_ ), specialty treatment costs for services
provided at the federal level ( _$44,830,000_ ), hospitalization costs (
_$287,260,000_ ), incarceration costs ( _$48,121,949,000_ ), premature
mortality costs (nonhomicide: _$16,005,008,000_ ), and premature mortality
costs (homicide: _$3,778,973,000_ ). These subtotal _$120,304,004_.

**17.** Anti-Drug Spending

"The narcotics trade has also significantly impeded fiscal growth and
stability by diverting scarce resources away from more-productive uses.
Between 1981 and 2008, federal, state, and local governments are estimated to
have spent at least $600 billion (adjusted for inflation) on drug interdiction
and related law enforcement efforts; factoring in costs associated with
treatment and rehabilitation, the overall total rises to around $800
billion.34 If one were to also add in 'invisible' losses brought about by
curtailed job opportunities and reduced workplace productivity, the true cost
would be far higher."

**18.** State Spending on Correctional Systems

"In 2010, state expenditures totaled $1.9 trillion dollars while state
spending on corrections was $48.5 billion. Between fiscal years 1982 and 2010,
spending on corrections represented between 1.9% and 3.3% of total
expenditures by state governments. Since 2003, corrections expenditures, as a
share of total spending, fluctuated between 2.5% and 2.9% of state
expenditures (figure 1).  
"Between 1982 and 2010, spending on education varied between 29% and 33% of
total state expenditures, spending on public welfare varied between 22% and
25%, spending on highways varied between 5.7% and 8.6%, and spending on health
care and hospitals varied between 6.2% and 7.5%. Other expenditures (including
air transportation, financial administration, police protection, and public
safety expenditures) ranged between 29% and 32% of state expenditures."

**19.** Total Spending on Corrections by State Governments

"In fiscal 2015, corrections spending represented 3.1 percent of total state
spending and 6.8 percent of general fund spending. General fund dollars are
the primary source for state corrections and accounted for $50.9 billion, or
89.5 percent, of all fiscal 2015 state corrections spending. State funds
(general funds and other state funds combined, but excluding bonds) accounted
for 97.7 percent of total state corrections spending in fiscal 2015. Federal
funds accounted for 1.2 percent and bonds accounted for 1.0 percent."

**20.** Trends in State Spending on Corrections in the US

"State spending on corrections reflects the costs to build and operate prison
systems and may include spending on juvenile justice systems and my include
spending on juvenile justice programs and alternatives to incarceration such
as probation and parole. State spending for corrections totaled $56.9 billion
in fiscal 2015, compared to $55.3 billion in fiscal 2014, a 3.0 percent
increase in total spending with state funds increasing 3.1 percent and federal
funds declining 1.4 percent. State spending on corrections in fiscal 2016 is
estimated to total $58.0 billion, a 2.0 percent increase from fiscal 2015.
State funds are estimated to increase by 2.1 percent, while federal funds are
estimated to increase by 3.6 percent.  
"Although state spending on corrections is estimated to increase for fiscal
2016, the growth rate has slowed. For several years states have been making
criminal justice reforms to address the cost drivers of corrections
expenditures, including limiting growth in inmate populations. Many states are
examining their criminal justice systems and implementing reforms to
concentrate resources on the most violent offenders while ensuring other
offenders are equipped with the tools and supports needed to successfully
transition back to the community. These reforms include alternatives to
incarceration, earning sentence credits for good behavior, other sentencing
changes, parole reforms, and increased treatment to address mental health and
substance abuse disorders. And while several states have been successful in
reducing the growth of their inmate population, costs continue to increase due
to programming investments, increasing inmate health care expenditures, costly
maintenance of aging facilities, and the personnel costs associated with
running institutions."

**21.** Growth in State Spending on Corrections in the US

"State correctional spending patterns reflect the rise in the prison
population that began in the early 1980’s and persisted until 2010.17
Expansion of the state prison population required increased spending for
capital infrastructure, the state employee workforce, and the administrative
needs of the judicial system. From fiscal 1986 to fiscal 2012, spending from
state funds18 for corrections increased by 427 percent  
from $9.9 billion to $52.4 billion (without adjusting for inflation).19 By
comparison, total spending from state funds increased by 315 percent over the
same time period.  
"For many states, the effect of disproportionate growth in correctional
spending led to a larger share of general fund dollars going to corrections.
Since the mid 1980’s, the share of general fund budgets going to corrections
doubled in 15 states and increased by at least half in 31 states.20 In the
aggregate, corrections spending has gone from 4.7 percent of general fund
spending in fiscal 1986 to 7.0 percent in fiscal 2012, an increase of 2.3
percentage points. This additional 2.3 percent of state general funds was
equivalent to $15 billion in fiscal 2012.21  
"Corrections expenditures, as a percent of spending from total state funds,
(general funds, other state funds and bonds), have remained more stable, and
the rate of increase has been lower compared to the growth in general fund
spending. Corrections spending as a share of state funds has gone from 3.6
percent in fiscal 1986 to 4.6 percent in fiscal 2012, an increase of 1
percent.22 This figure has  
remained more stable due to the rise in earmarked funds or trust funds in
other program areas besides corrections that designate revenues for specific
purposes set by statute. For example, higher education derives much of its
state funding from designated revenue streams outside the general fund. To
some extent, this trend may have insulated other program areas from budgetary
pressures related to increased general fund spending for corrections."

**22.** State Expenditure Per Prison Inmate

According to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2010, state
corrections institutions spent $37.3 billion to imprison a total of 1,316,858
inmates. BJS estimates that the mean expenditures per capita was $28,323.
There was a wide range in state spending: the bottom 25th percentile averaged
only $21,417, the 50th percentile averaged $29,094, and the 75th percentile
averaged $40,175.

**23.** Spending on Substance Abuse and Addiction

" The federal government spent $238.2 billion on substance abuse and
addiction or 9.6 percent of the federal budget. If substance abuse and
addiction were its own budget category, it would rank sixth in size--behind
social security, national defense, income security, Medicare and other health
programs.  
" State governments, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico,
spent 15.7 percent of their budgets ($135.8 billion) to deal with substance
abuse and addiction--up from 13.3 percent in 1998. If substance abuse and
addiction were its own budget category, it would rank second behind elementary
and secondary education. States spend more on substance abuse and addiction
than they spend on Medicaid, higher education, transportation or justice.  
" Local governments spent conservatively $93.8 billion on substance abuse and
addiction or 9.0 percent of local budgets, outstripping local spending for
transportation and public welfare."

**24.** State Drug Reforms As Cost-Saving Mechanisms

"In general, states are targeting criminal justice reforms to address the cost
drivers of correctional budgets in such a way that public safety is not put at
risk. For example, 21 states have amended drug offense classification and
penalties since 2010.26 Justice reforms that seek incarceration alternatives
for drug offenders have demonstrated cost savings and improved outcomes,
especially for non-violent drug offenders. Texas appropriated $240 million in
the 2008-2009 biennium for correctional programs focusing on treatment,
rehabilitation and enhanced local supervision and discretion. The state’s
reforms led to $443 million in estimated savings that were utilized for other
areas of the corrections budget.27 Justice reinvestment reforms are relying
more on local government discretion as well, to enhance probation and parole
oversight. Twenty states have enacted graduated sanctions for technical parole
violations to help states reduce prison costs and the number of inmates.28  
"Despite the demonstrated successes of criminal justice reforms, cost savings
have yet to produce an overall decline in corrections spending. However, the
policy reforms are improving the way states spend money for corrections, and
the outcomes show better results for individuals and citizens. Over time, the
cost savings from smart, criminal justice polices may lead to correctional
spending declines, an outcome that would benefit all of state government."

**25.** Spending on Prevention, Treatment and Research

"Only 2.4 percent of total federal and state substance-related spending in
2005 ($8.8 billion) was for prevention, treatment or research; only 1.9
percent ($7.2 billion) was for prevention and treatment. (Table 6.1) For every
dollar federal and state governments spend to prevent and treat substance
abuse and addiction, they spend $59.83 in public programs shoveling up its
wreckage, despite a substantial and growing body of scientific evidence
confirming the efficacy of science-based interventions and their enormous
cost-saving potential."

**26.** Growth in State Spending on Corrections, 1986-2001

"State spending for corrections increased from $65 per resident in 1986 to
$134 in 2001 (table 1). Per capita expenditures for State prison operations
alone rose from $49 in 1986 to $104 in 2001.  
"At an average annual increase of 6.2% for total State correctional spending
and 6.4% specifically for prisons, increases in the cost of adult
incarceration outpaced those of health care (5.8%), education (4.2%), and
natural resources (3.3%).  
"Although correctional spending grew at a faster rate than many other State
boards and programs (including court payments between 1986 and 2001, it
remained one of the smaller cost items. For example, the outlay for education,
at $374.5 billion, was nearly 10 times larger, and that for welfare, at $260.3
billion, was nearly 7 times larger."

**27.** Cost Effectiveness of Substance Abuse Treatment

"Substance abuse treatment is more cost-effective than prison or other
punitive measures. The Washington State Institute for Public Policy (WSIPP)
found that drug treatment conducted within the community is extremely
beneficial in terms of cost, especially compared to prison. Every dollar spent
on drug treatment in the community is estimated to return $18.52 in benefits
to society."

**29.** Cost of Marijuana Enforcement in Rhode Island

"In 2007, there were 1,922 arrests for first-time marijuana possession in

down 1 percent from the average cost in 2010. For federal wiretaps for which
expenses were reported in 2011, the average cost was $71,748, a 13 percent
increase from 2010. The cost of a state wiretap ranged from a low of $200 in
Hudson County, New Jersey, to a high of $2,885,712 for a narcotics
investigation conducted by the New York Organized Crime Task Force."

**34.** Money Laundering and Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations

"Mexico is a major drug producing and transit country. Proceeds from the
illicit drug trade leaving the United States are the principal source of funds
laundered through the Mexican financial system. Other significant sources of
illegal proceeds being laundered include corruption, kidnapping, extortion,
piracy, human trafficking, and trafficking in firearms. Sophisticated and
well-organized drug trafficking organizations based in Mexico take advantage
of the extensive U.S.-Mexico border, the large flow of legitimate remittances,
Mexico’s proximity to Central American countries, and the high volume of legal
commerce to conceal transfers to Mexico. The smuggling of bulk shipments of
U.S. currency into Mexico and the repatriation of the funds into the United
States via couriers or armored vehicles, trade, and wire transfers remain
favored methods for laundering drug proceeds. Though the combination of a
sophisticated financial sector and a large cash-based informal sector
complicates the problem, the 2010 implementation of U.S. dollar deposit
restrictions reduced the amount of bulk cash repatriation back to the United
States via the formal financial sector by approximately 70 percent, or $10
billion. According to U.S. authorities, drug trafficking organizations send
between $19 and $29 billion annually to Mexico from the United States, though
the Government of Mexico disputes this figure. Since 2002, Mexico has seized a
total of more than $500 million in bulk currency shipments."

**35.** Estimated Savings from Legalizing Drugs in the US

"The report estimates that legalizing drugs would save roughly $48.7 billion
per year in government expenditure on enforcement of prohibition. $33.1
billion of this savings would accrue to state and local governments, while
$15.6 billion would accrue to the federal government. Approximately $13.7
billion of the savings would results from legalization of marijuana, $22.3
billion from legalization of cocaine and heroin, and $12.8 from legalization
of other drugs."

**37.** Historical Prices of Illicit Drugs

"In summary, prices for powder cocaine, crack, and heroin declined sharply in
the 1980s and have declined more gradually since then, with periodic
interruptions by modest price spikes that have usually persisted for a year or
less. For d-methamphetamine, the pattern is broadly similar, but the price
spikes appear to be larger and longer-lasting, particularly for 1989–1991.
Marijuana prices have followed a very different pattern, increasing from 1981
to 1991, then declining through 2000 and increasing over the past three
years."

**38.** Drug-Related Public Expenditures in the EU

**Economics**

"Economic analysis can be an important tool for policy evaluation, although
the limited information available on drug-related public expenditure in Europe
represents a major obstacle and makes comparison between countries difficult.
For the 16 countries that have produced estimates since 2002, drug-related
public expenditure ranges from 0.01% to 0.5% of their gross domestic product
(GDP). From the information available, it appears that the largest share of
drug-related public expenditure is allocated to drug supply reduction
activities (Figure 4.4).  
"Public expenditure on supply reduction includes, among other things,
expenditure on drug-law offenders in prisons. The EMCDDA calculated a range of
estimates, where the low estimate considers only those prisoners who have been
sentenced for a drug-law offence and the high estimate also includes pre-trial
prisoners who may be sentenced for a drug-law offence. Applying these
criteria, European countries spent an estimated 0.03% of GDP, or EUR 3.7
billion, on drug-law offenders in prison in 2010. Including pre-trial
prisoners, the estimate rises to 0.05% of GDP or EUR 5.9 billion."

**40.** Drug Control Expenditures Through the 1990s

"The most recent figures available from the Office of National Drug Control
Policy (ONDCP) indicate that, in 1999, federal expenditures on control of
illegal drugs surpassed $17 billion; combined expenditures by federal, state,
and local governments exceeded $30 billion. What is more, the nation's so-
called 'drug war' is a protracted one. The country has spent roughly this
amount annually throughout the 1990s."

**41.** Mexican Marijuana Imports to the US

"• Mexican DTOs’ gross revenues from moving marijuana across the border into
the United States and selling it to wholesalers is likely less than $2
billion, and our preferred estimate is closer to $1.5 billion. This figure
does not include revenue from DTO production and distribution in the United
States, which is extremely difficult to estimate with existing data.  
"• The ubiquitous claim that 60 percent of Mexican DTO export revenues come
from U.S. marijuana consumption (Fainaru and Booth, 2009; Yes on 19, undated)
should not be taken seriously. No publicly available source verifies or
explains this figure and subsequent analyses revealed great uncertainty about
the estimate (GAO, 2007). Our analysis— though preliminary on this
point—suggests that 15–26 percent is a more credible range of the share of
drug export revenues attributable to marijuana."

**42.** US Counternarcotics Spending in South and Central America

"However, during fiscal years 2000-2005, the United States provided about $6.2
billion to support counternarcotics and related programs in the source and
transit zones (see table 1).12 In the source zone, U.S. assistance supports
eradication and interdiction efforts and related programs for alternative
development and judicial reform, primarily in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru. In
the transit zone, the United States provided about $365 million in
assistance—primarily to El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Mexico —to support
interdiction and other law enforcement programs."  
"For fiscal year 2006, the Administration has requested an additional $735
million for countries in the source zone and $77 million for countries in the
transit zone."  
"From fiscal year 2000 through 2005, the United States provided about $365
million in assistance to countries in the transit zone. Of this, Mexico
received approximately $115 million to support its efforts to eradicate opium
poppy and marijuana, and improve surveillance and intelligence capabilities."

**43.** Diversion and Fraud

"According to law enforcement reporting, some individuals and criminal groups
divert CPDs [controlled prescription drugs] through doctor-shopping and use
insurance fraud to fund their schemes. In fact, Aetna, Inc. reports that
nearly half of its 1,065 member fraud cases in 2006 (the latest year for which
data are available) involved prescription benefits, and most were related to
doctor-shopping, according to the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud (CAIF).
CAIF further reports that diversion of CPDs collectively costs insurance
companies up to $72.5 billion annually, nearly two-thirds of which is paid by
public insurers. Individual insurance plans lose an estimated $9 million to
$850 million annually, depending on each plan’s size; much of that cost is
passed on to consumers through higher annual premiums."

**48.** Global Illicit Drug Trade

Worldwide/International Basic Data

"The global value of the illicit drug trade is extremely difficult to
calculate, and as a result estimates have varied dramatically. The 2005 UNODC
World Drug Report estimated the worldwide drug trade at $320 billion.8 By
contrast, also in 2005, in an issue of The Journal of Drug Issues, Francisco
E. Thoumi stated that an unpublished 1999 study by Peter Reuter was 'probably
the most serious attempt to ascertain the size of the world illegal drug
market.'9 Reuter’s study estimated the value of the market at a range between
$45 and $280 billion. Peter Reuter also participated in a more recent study
for the European Commission which does not report 'a total estimate for all
drugs globally,'10 but does find best estimates of retail revenues to be 'less
than one half those of the UNODC, though there is considerable uncertainty.'11

**49.** UN Estimate, Drugs and Transnational Crime

"If only flows related to drug trafficking and other transnational organized
crime activities were considered, related proceeds would have been equivalent
to around US$650 billion per year in the first decade of the new millennium,
equivalent to 1.5% of global GDP or US$870 billion in 2009 assuming that the
proportions remained unchanged. The funds available for laundering through the
financial system would have been equivalent to some 1% of global GDP or US$580
billion in 2009.  
"The largest income for transnational organized crime comes from illicit
drugs, which account for some 20% (17%-25%) of all crime proceeds, about half
of transnational organized crime proceeds and 0.6% to 0.9% of global GDP. In
turn, drug-related proceeds available for money-laundering through the
financial system would be equivalent to between 0.4% and 0.6% of global GDP."

**50.** Distribution of Revenue from Illicit Drug Trafficking

" While estimating the size of global and hemispheric drug markets presents
tremendous challenges, evidence suggests that some two thirds of total
revenues are earned at the final, retail level in consuming countries.  
" Wholesalers and traffickers through transit countries account for another
20-25 percent of revenues, while just under 1 percent of total retail sales
finds its way to drug cultivators in the Andes."

Chapter 4: The Economics of Drug Trafficking," 2013, p. 5.  
http://www.cicad.oas.org/Main/...

**51.** Markups in Illegal Trade and Possible Impact of Legalization

"Markups in the illicit drug trade are orders of magnitude higher than markups
for legal goods. For example, coffee beans cost around five times more at
retail than at farm gate, whereas heroin costs around 170 times more.46
Markups are higher for a number of reasons: participants must be compensated
for the risks of incarceration and violence, prohibition reduces the
efficiency of production and distribution, the supply chain is long with a
large number of middlemen, and some participants have substantial market
power. On the production side, the illicit nature of the drug trade reduces
efficiency, as drug cultivation must be concealed, transport may not take
direct routes and requires extensive bribes, and a drug dealer typically
handles far fewer transactions per day than a pharmacist or grocer. Finally,
at certain segments of the supply chain, participants may exercise significant
market power through controlling trafficking routes or consumer markets. The
fact that they face at most limited competition allows them to set higher
prices.  
"For many drugs, especially those that are plant-based, markups could fall
substantially if the substances were produced, transported, and distributed
like other commercial goods. Using reasonable assumptions about the cost of
transport and retail markups under a commercialized regime, one 2012 study
calculates that the price of cocaine (prior to any taxation or fees) could
fall 96 percent, from about $66 to $2.78 per gram at 63 percent purity, and
retail heroin prices could fall by 98 percent, from about $140 to $3 per gram
at 55 percent purity.47 For marijuana, a recent study calculates that if high-
potency marijuana could be legally cultivated in large grow houses (at
$200-$400 per pound), the retail price per ounce could fall by more than 80
percent.48 If plants could be cultivated in large outdoor fields, the same
study estimates that the price decline would be even greater, albeit for a
less potent substance. These same studies do not take into account the impact
of any taxation or other administrative fees that could be imposed to raise
retail prices closer to previous levels."

**52.** Value of Global Opiate Market

"The global opiate market was valued at US$68 billion in 2009, with heroin
consumers contributing US$61 billion. The value of the world heroin market
tends to increase according to the number of international borders crossed by
traffickers. That is, heroin is generally cheaper in Afghanistan, a production
country, than in West and Central Europe, where the drugs have been
transported by various means across long distances and changed hands a number
of times. However, this pattern can be deceptive, as heroin prices and
consumption levels vary significantly across countries and regions.  
"Heroin prices fluctuate significantly across the globe, and Australia is the
starkest example of global price variation. Although Australian users
represent just 0.85% of total global heroin consumption, they contribute 4% of
the global market value. The street value per gram of heroin is between
US$230–370 in Australia whereas one gram of heroin was worth around US$170-200
in the USA and northern Europe, and consumers in West and Central Europe paid
US$40-100 per gram. Overall, the Russian Federation and West and Central
Europe contributed almost half of the total global market value, accounting
for US$31 billion in 2009."

**53.** Money Laundering and the Global Opiate Market

"Of the US$ 65 billion turnover of the global market for opiates, only 5-10
per cent (US$ 3-5 billion) are estimated to be laundered by informal banking
systems. The rest is laundered through legal trade activities (including
smuggling of legal goods into Afghanistan) and the banking system."

**54.** Cocaine Market Profit Distribution

"In 2008, of the $35 billion U.S. cocaine market, for example, coca farmers in
the developing source countries made about $500 million. This equates to 1.4
percent of gross profits. Traffickers within the source countries then made
approximately $400 million (one percent), followed by international
traffickers (i.e. Mexican drug cartels) who made $4.6 billion (13 percent).25
When added together, only 15 percent ($5.4 billion) of the $35 billion retail
value was made in developing source or transit countries. This means that
$29.6 billion was generated after the drugs entered the United States."

**56.** Cost of Substance Abuse in Canada

"In 2006 a team of researchers published estimates of the social costs of
substance abuse in Canada across several domains based on 2002 data (Rehm et
al., 2006). Total costs of substance abuse for all substances (including
tobacco) were estimated to be $39.8 billion in 2002, which translates into
$1,267 per capita. Of this, approximately 39% are direct costs to the economy
associated with health care, enforcement, prevention/research and 'other
costs'6, and 61% are indirect costs associated mainly with productivity losses
resulting from premature death and disability. Figure 2 depicts the estimated
direct social costs associated with alcohol, illicit drugs and cannabis in
2002.  
"Important findings from Figure 2 include the fact that (1) total direct
social costs associated with alcohol ($7,427.5 million) are more than double
those for all illicit drugs combined ($3,565.5 million); (2) direct alcohol-
related health care costs ($3,306.2 million) are nearly three times as high as
for all illicit drugs, excluding cannabis ($1,061.6 million), and over 45
times higher than the direct health care costs of cannabis ($73 million); and
(3) annual direct costs for health care ($4,440.7 million) are 31 times
higher, and annual direct costs for enforcement ($5,407.7 million) are 36
times higher than annual costs for prevention and research ($147.6 million)."

**57.** Global Value of Illicit Goods Market

"The global illicit flow of goods, guns, people, and natural resources is
estimated at approximately $650 billion. Though data is scarce and experts are
constantly debating the relative merits and weaknesses of every new study, it
is generally accepted that illicit drug trafficking and counterfeiting are the
two most valuable markets. This report finds the illicit drug trade to be
worth roughly $320 billion and counterfeiting $250 billion."

**58.** Afghan Opium Production

"In 2011, the estimated potential opium production amounted to 5,800 mt, an
increase by 61% over 2010. As opium cultivation remained relatively stable
between 2009 and 2011, the differences in opium production in those years were
due to changes in per-hectare opium yield. 2009 was a year with high opium
yields (56.1 kg/ha), while in 2010, major opium cultivation areas were
affected by plant diseases, which led to a strong yield reduction (29.2
kg/ha). In 2011, opium yields were back to “normal” levels of 44.5 kg/ha. In
2011, the Southern region continued to produce most opium in Afghanistan,
representing 85% of national production, followed by the Western region
(12%)."

**59.** Economics - Data - Global - 2003 - 1-15-10

**_(UN Estimate of Value of Global Illicit Drug Market_ )** "If compared to
global licit exports (US$7,503 bn in 2003) or compared to global GDP
(US$35,765 bn in 2003) the estimated size [of] the global illicit drug market
may not appear to be particularly high (0.9% of global GDP at retail level or
1.3% of global exports measures at wholesale level).  
"Nonetheless, the size of the global illicit drug market is substantial. The
value, measured at retail prices, is higher than the GDP of 88% of the
countries in the world (163 out of 184 for which the World Bank has GDP data)
and equivalent to about three quarters of Sub-Saharan Africa's combined GDP
(US$439 bn in 2003). The sale of drugs, measured at wholesale prices, was
equivalent to 12% of global export of chemicals (US$794 bn), 14% of global
agricultural exports (US$674 bn) and exceeded global exports of ores and other
minerals (US$79 bn) in 2003. Such sales of drugs were also higher than the
combined total licit agricultural exports from Latin America (US$75 bn) and
the Middle East (US$10 bn) in 2003."

**60.** Estimate of Global Retail Cannabis Market

"The UNODC (2005) estimates that the world retail market for cannabis was
about €125 Billion4 circa 2003; more than the retail markets for cocaine and
opiates combined. The US is believed to be the largest contributor to this
estimate, but the exact size of that market is far from settled. Indeed, some
of the estimates of the US market vary by a factor of 10.  
"The UNODC’s macro estimates indicate that North America and Western/Central
Europe account for 45% and 28% of the world cannabis market, respectively. The
UNODC’s input-output model suggests that each past year user in North America
consumed 165 grams of cannabis herb at almost €10 per gram. With approximately
25 million past-year users in the US during this time, the UNODC calculations
imply that retail cannabis expenditures in the US exceeded €40 billion. This
is more than four times the retail estimate generated by the White House’s
Office of National Drug Control Policy for 2000." [all monetary values are in

**61.** UN Estimate of Value of Illicit Drug Market

"Based on the inputs and the calculations explained above, the value of the
global illicit drug market for the year 2003 was estimated at US$13 bn
[billion] at the production level, at $94 bn at the wholesale level (taking
seizures into account), and at US$322bn based on retail prices and taking
seizures and other losses into account. This indicates that despite seizures
and losses, the value of the drugs increase substantially as they move from
producer to consumer.  
"The largest market, according to these estimates, is cannabis herb (with a
retail market size of $113 bn), followed by cocaine (US$71 bn), the opiates
(US$65bn) and cannabis resin (US$29 bn). The ATS markets together
(methamphetamine, amphetamine and ecstasy) amount to US$44 bn. The valuation
does not take into account the value of other drugs."

**_(Value of Illegal Drug Exports from the Caribbean_ )** "The value of
illegal drug exports from the Caribbean during the past two decades has fallen
into two very well differentiated periods. The first period, from 1981 to
1990, was an epoch of impressive depression in the total value of the
Caribbean drugs exports -- from an income over US$20bn at its peak in 1983 to
US$5bn in 1991. Since 1991, the value of Caribbean exports of illegal drugs
has stabilised around US$5bn."

**_(Estimates of Size of the World Illegal Drug Market_ )** "It is also worth
noting that by 1999, the UNDCP had not attempted to follow up its efforts to
estimate the size of the world illegal drug market. That year, the Financial
Action Task Force (FATF) [an inter-governmental body focusing on anti-money
laundering activities and legislation] decided to begin work to assess the
size of the world illegal economy and found it convenient to start with an
estimate of the illegal drug market, a task that was considered easier than
estimating other illegal activities, given the large work on drugs already
available. FATF hired Peter Reuter, a well-known economist who has done
extensive work on illegal drug markets, and produced an estimate. This job had
the full cooperation of the UNDCP, which opened its data bank to the
researcher.  
"The resulting study is probably the most serious attempt to ascertain the
size of the world illegal drug market and resulted in an estimated range
between $45 and $280 billion."

**64.** Afghan Opium

"In 2011, opium prices had reached high levels as a result of the unusually
low opium production in 2010, when major cultivation areas were affected by
plant diseases.

"Results from the 2009 opium survey indicated that the low opium price level
in that year discouraged farmers from planting opium. However, since then,
opium prices have tripled. The high sale price of opium in combination with
lower wheat prices may have encouraged famers to resume opium cultivation. The
high level of opium prices in 2011 continues to provide a strong incentive to
plant opium in the upcoming poppy season."

revenue from opiate farming and trade accruing to Taliban insurgents is
estimated at US$ 350-650 million, or an annual average of US$ 90-160 million
in Afghanistan alone. This estimate does not include insurgents’ potential
revenues from other drug-related activities (labs, imports of precursors) in
Afghanistan and from the US$1 billion opiate trade in Pakistan."

**67.** Public Health Benefits of Drug Control Spending

Econometric and Sociopolitical Research

"The long-run elasticities provide a basis for estimating potential benefits
from changing the current policy mix away from enforcement and interdiction
and towards education and treatment. Applying the estimated coefficients, a 10
percent reduction in expenditures on enforcement (about 1 billion dollars by
the late 1990s) would be associated with a long-run reduction of over 20% in
both the number of deaths and the age-adjusted death rate. This would imply
that close to 3,000 deaths a year might be avoided with a shift away from
enforcement approaches to drug control. Adding the billion dollars to
education and treatment would represent an 18% increase in 1998. The estimated
elasticity of 1.59 implies a reduction of close to 5,000 drug-induced deaths
per year as a result. Thus, the underlying estimates suggest that very
substantial improvements in public health may be achieved by emphasizing
education and treatment over enforcement and interdiction."

**68.** Demand Elasticity

"When the price of an illicit drug changes, the quantity consumed by existing
users may change and the total number of users may also respond. The
percentage change in total consumption resulting from a 1 percent change in
price is referred to as the demand elasticity. For cocaine and cannabis, the
elasticity of demand has been estimated at around -0.5, indicating that demand
falls by 0.5 percent when price increases by 1 percent.15 This elasticity is
similar to that observed for tobacco and implies that a price increase more
than compensates for the reduction in demand and results in higher overall
drug revenues. There are fewer studies for heroin, but a reasonable estimate
for elasticity appears to be around -0.3.16 For methamphetamine, a successful
U.S. government effort to reduce the supply of precursor chemicals led the
price of the drug to temporarily triple and the purity to decline from 90
percent to 20 percent.17 Simultaneously, amphetamine-related hospital
admissions dropped by 50 percent, and use among arrestees declined by 55
percent. However, these indicators returned to their previous levels within
four months as prices fell and purity increased."

**69.** Loss of Economic Output Due to Criminal Record

"Our estimates suggest that ex-offenders lower overall employment rates as
much as 0.8 to 0.9 percentage points; male employment rates, as much as 1.5 to
1.7 percentage points; and those of less-educated men as much as 6.1 to 6.9
percentage points. These employment losses hit ex-offenders hardest, but also
impose a substantial cost on the U.S. economy in the form of lost output of
goods and services. In GDP terms, we estimate that in 2008 these employment
losses cost the country $57 to $65 billion per year."

**70.** Drug Markets and the Local Economy

"Although the image contained within such quotes is of an external threat
associated with the drugs trade, in fact, as May and colleagues were able to
show, some of the drug-dealing markets were very much part of the local
community – involving people who had lived within the local community for many
years. Other drug markets in other areas involved individuals who had no
connection to the wider community and whose activities were seen as
threatening the local area. While May and colleagues point to the various
negative impacts of local drug-selling activities on the wider community, they
also point out that such markets could be seen as having a positive impact on
the surrounding community. For example, the presence of a drug-dealing market
could mean the influx of substantial cash that would otherwise not occur as
local drug dealers spent the money earned from their drug-selling activities.
Similarly, it was claimed by some of those interviewed that the presence of a
drug-dealing market could result in lower levels of other crimes as the drug
sellers themselves sought to reduce the activities of other criminals that
might attract unwanted police attention. Finally, the presence of a drug
market could sustain a thriving market in stolen goods being transacted as a
way of supporting a drug habit, one of the results of this being that local
people had access to a level of consumer products at reduced prices that they
might otherwise never be able to afford."

**71.** Use in Low Income Areas

"Although residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods, neighborhoods with high
concentrations of minorities, and neighborhoods with high population densities
reported much higher levels of visible drug sales, they reported only slightly
higher levels of drug use, along with somewhat higher levels of drug
dependency. This finding indicates that conflating drug sales with use, so
that poor and minority areas are assumed to be the focus of the problem of
drug use, is plainly wrong. The finding is based on the data collected across
41 sites, including city and suburban (but not rural) areas in all regions."

**72.** Disadvantaged Areas

"Although serious drug use is slightly more prevalent in poor minority
neighborhoods than elsewhere, the major problem for disadvantaged
neighborhoods is drug distribution. These communities are victims not only of
their own drug abuse but also of a criminal drug market that serves the entire
society. The market establishes itself in disadvantaged communities in part
because of the low social capital in these neighborhoods. The drug economy
further erodes that social capital."

**74.** Economic Incentive for Prison Construction

"The economic benefits of new prisons may come from the flow of additional
state and federal dollars. In the decennial census, prisoners are counted
where they are incarcerated, and many federal and state funding streams are
tied to census population counts. According to the U.S. General Accounting
Office (2003), the federal government distributes over $140 billion in grant
money to state and local governments through formula-based grants. Formula
grant money is in part based on census data and covers programs such as
Medicaid, Foster Care, Adoption Assistance, and Social Services Block Grant
(U.S. General Accounting Office 2003). Within a state, funding for community
health services, road construction and repair, public housing, local law
enforcement, and public libraries are all driven by population counts from the
census."

**75.** Drug Dealing and Employment

The average "dealer" holds a low-wage job and sells part-time to obtain drugs
for his or her own use. "Earnings for drug selling were positively correlated
(though weakly) with legitimate earnings. Drug selling seemed to be a
complement to, rather than a substitute for, legitimate employment."

Economics of Drug Dealing in Washington DC (Santa Monica, CA: The RAND
Corporation, 1990), pp. 49-50.

**76.** Economics of Prison Construction

"The few studies on the local economic impacts of prisons to date have not
found significant positive impacts. For example, a study by the Sentencing
Project challenges the notion that a new prison brings economic benefits to
smaller communities. Using 25 years of data from New York State rural
counties, the authors looked at employment rates and per capita income and
found 'no significant difference or discernible pattern of economic trends'
between counties that were home to a prison and counties that were not home to
a prison (King, Mauer, and Huling 2003). According to a recent study by Iowa
State University, many towns that made sizeable investments in prisons did not
reap the economic gains that were predicted (Besser 2003). Another analysis in
Texas found no impacts as measured by consumer spending in nearly three-
fourths of the areas examined (Chuang 1998)."

**77.** Effect of Termination of Addiction Disability Payments

"While the aim of SSI [Supplemental Security Income] addiction disability
termination was, for conservatives, to force individuals to take greater
responsibility in their lives and to decrease dependence on governmentally
funded programs, this goal appears nearly impossible to achieve given the lack
of resources had by this under-skilled and poor population. Nor did the policy
change necessarily decrease their risk of continued involvement in drugs and
crime. We estimate that losing a stable housing situation has placed
respondents at greater risk for continued drug and alcohol use, something not
considered by extant etiological work on individual substance abuse. These
consequences could mean a greater dependence of this population on state and
federally funded programs."

Reform and Housing: Assessing the Impact to Substance Abusers," Journal of
Drug Issues (Tallahassee, FL: Florida State University, Winter 2002), Vol. 32,

**78.** Substance Use, Welfare Reform, and Housing

"First, PRWORA of 1996 has destabilized the housing situations of the
respondents and has placed them at greater risk for various types of housing
problems and homelessness. Second, these housing complications have
exacerbated numerous social problems (drug and alcohol abuse, crime, and
victimization). It is important to consider, however, that changes in the
housing market, decreased housing subsidies, and individual characteristics
and behaviors also played a role in these negative outcomes.  
"More specifically, we found considerable housing dependency, at some level,
for all respondents, albeit most often among those who currently had no SSI
benefits. Problematic dependence on family, friends, and significant others
(doubling up or sharing housing with other adults) was most common, followed
by dependence on state-funded program. Independent living (e.g., having one's
own place and paying one's own rent), which we would hope for most by middle-
age, was an uncommon occurrence."

**79.** Termination of Benefits and Risk of Substance Use

"A qualitative analysis, featuring in-depth interviews with 101, nonrandomly
selected former recipients revealed that disability benefits promoted housing
autonomy, successful cohabitation, and overall housing stability. The
termination of benefits, at a time of diminishing social services (e.g., cash
and housing assistance) and a housing market explosion, increased various
types of homelessness for respondents and dependency on family and friends.
Such negative living outcomes, in turn, further escalated the risk of drug and
alcohol use, criminal participation, and victimization."

**80.** Drug Sales and the Informal Economy

In a report funded by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, researchers
concluded that "drug sales in poor neighborhoods are part of a growing
informal economy which has expanded and innovatively organized in response to
the loss of good jobs." The report characterizes drug dealing as
"fundamentally a lower class response [to the information economy] by men and
women with little formal education and few formal skills," and the report
notes "If the jobs won't be created by either the public or private sector,
then poor people will have to create the jobs themselves."

**81.** Drug Control Models

"In the most common English usage **decriminalisation** is the elimination of
a conduct or activity from the sphere of criminal law, while
**depenalisation** is simply the relaxation of the penal sanction provided for
by law. The term decriminalisation is most commonly used in reference to
offences related to drug consumption and usually manifested by the imposition
of sanctions of a different kind (administrative) or the abolition of all
sanctions; other (non-criminal) laws can then regulate the conduct or activity
that has been decriminalised. Depenalisation can refer to consumption-related
offences (which may be dealt with through referral schemes or alternative
sanctions for drug users) but also to small-scale trading, generally
indicating elimination or reduction of custodial penalties, although the
conduct or activity remains a criminal offence. Confusingly, in Spanish,
depenalisation often refers to what in English is most often called
decriminalisation. **Legalisation** is the removal from the sphere of criminal
law of all drug-related offences: use, possession, cultivation, production,
trading, and so on. **Regulation** refers to a strictly controlled legal
market, in which administrative rather than criminal law regulates production,
distribution and price (by taxation); and limits availability and access,
using models developed for pharmaceutical drugs, alcohol and tobacco."

Learned and Strategic Challenges for the Future," Global Commission on Drug
Policies (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: January 2011), p. 9.

**82.** Drug Supply Models

_Prescription_  
"The prescription model is the most tightly controlled and enforced drug
supply model currently in operation. Under this model, drugs are prescribed to
a named user by a qualified and licensed medical practitioner. They are
dispensed by a licensed practitioner or pharmacist from a licensed pharmacy or
other designated outlet."  
_Pharmacy model_  
"The pharmacy model, whilst still working within a clearly defined medical
framework, is less restrictive and controlling than the prescription model.
Pharmacists are trained and licensed to dispense prescriptions, although they
cannot write them. They can also sell certain generally lower risk medical
drugs from behind the counter."  
_Licensed sales_  
"Current best practice in licensed sales of alcohol and tobacco offers a less
restrictive, more flexible infrastructure for the licensed sales of certain
lower risk non-medical drugs (see: 5.1 Alcohol, page 100, and 5.2 Tobacco,
page 105). Such a system would put various combinations of regulatory controls
in place to manage the vendor, the supply outlet, the product and the
purchaser, as appropriate."  
_Licensed premises_  
"Public houses and bars serving alcohol offer the most common example of
premises licensed for sale and consumption. Under this long established
system, various controls exist over the venue and (in particular) the
licensee."  
_Unlicensed sales_  
"Certain psychoactive substances deemed sufficiently low risk, such as coffee,
traditional use of coca tea and some low strength painkillers, are subject to
little or no licensing. Here, regulation focuses on standard product
descriptions and labelling."

Regulation," (Bristol, United Kingdom: September 2009) pp. 20, 23, 24-27.

**83.** Effect of Prohibition on Drug Use

"Prohibition has two effects: on one hand it raises supplier costs, disrupts
market functioning and prevents open promotion of the product; on the other,
it sacrifices the authorities’ ability to tax transactions and regulate
operation of the market, product characteristics and promotional activity of
suppliers. The cannabis prevalence rates presented in Figure 1 show clearly
that prohibition has failed to prevent widespread use of the drug and leaves
open the possibility that it might be easier to control the harmful use of
cannabis by regulation of a legal market than to control illicit consumption
under prohibition. The contrast between the general welcome for tobacco
regulation (including bans on smoking in public places) and the deep suspicion
of prohibition policy on cannabis is striking and suggests that a middle
course of legalised but limited consumption may find a public consensus."

**84.** Cost/Benefit of Adult Offender Drug Treatment

"The legislature directed the Washington State Institute for Public Policy
(Institute) to evaluate the costs and benefits of certain juvenile and adult
criminal justice policies, violence prevention programs, and other efforts to
decrease particular 'at-risk' behaviors of youth."  
With regard to adult offender drug treatment programs, it found, "Generally,
drug treatment for adult offenders works to lower criminal recidivism rates.
The degree to which recidivism is reduced is not large—single digit, not
double digit, percentage reductions in recidivism rates should be expected.
Nonetheless, with treatment typically costing about $2,500 per participant,
the net economics of drug treatment appear positive, on average. The programs
roughly break even from a taxpayer-only perspective and, including the
benefits crime victims receive when recidivism rates are reduced, the programs
typically produce about three dollars in benefits per dollar of cost."

Treatment Programs.
