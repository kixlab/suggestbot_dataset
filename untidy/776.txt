>>

>> The **Cretaceous** ( / krɪˈteɪʃəs/, _kri- TAY-shəs_ ) is a geologic period
and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period 145
million years ago (mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period 66 mya. It is
the last period of the Mesozoic Era, and the longest period of the Phanerozoic
Eon. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated **K** , for its German
translation _Kreide_ (chalk, _creta_ in Latin).

>>

>> The Cretaceous was a period with a relatively warm climate, resulting in
high eustatic sea levels that created numerous shallow inland seas. These
oceans and seas were populated with now-extinct marine reptiles, ammonites and
rudists, while dinosaurs continued to dominate on land. During this time, new
groups of mammals and birds, as well as flowering plants, appeared.

>>

>> The Cretaceous (along with the Mesozoic) ended with the
Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a large mass extinction in which many
groups, including non- avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs and large marine reptiles
died out. The end of the Cretaceous is defined by the abrupt
Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), a geologic signature associated
with the mass extinction which lies between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras.

>> ## Geology[edit]

>> ### Research history[edit]

>>

>> The Cretaceous as a separate period was first defined by Belgian geologist
Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy in 1822,[1] using strata in the Paris Basin[2] and
named for the extensive beds of chalk (calcium carbonate deposited by the
shells of marine invertebrates, principally coccoliths), found in the upper
Cretaceous of Western Europe.[a] The name Cretaceous was derived from Latin
_creta_ , meaning _chalk_.[3]

>>

>> ### Stratigraphic subdivisions[edit]

>>

>> The Cretaceous is divided into Early and Late Cretaceous epochs, or Lower
and Upper Cretaceous series. In older literature the Cretaceous is sometimes
divided into three series: Neocomian (lower/early), Gallic (middle) and
Senonian (upper/late). A subdivision in eleven stages, all originating from
European stratigraphy, is now used worldwide. In many parts of the world,
alternative local subdivisions are still in use.

>>

>> As with other older geologic periods, the rock beds of the Cretaceous are
well identified but the exact age of the system's base is uncertain by a few
million years. No great extinction or burst of diversity separates the
Cretaceous from the Jurassic. However, the top of the system is sharply
defined, being placed at an iridium-rich layer found worldwide that is
believed to be associated with the Chicxulub impact crater, with its
boundaries circumscribing parts of the Yucatán Peninsula and into the Gulf of
Mexico. This layer has been dated at 66.043 Ma.[4]

>>

>> A 140 Ma age for the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary instead of the usually
accepted 145 Ma was proposed in 2014 based on a stratigraphic study of Vaca
Muerta Formation in Neuquén Basin, Argentina.[5] Víctor Ramos, one of the
authors of the study proposing the 140 Ma boundary age sees the study as a
"first step" toward formally changing the age in the International Union of
Geological Sciences.[6]

>>

>>

>> The high sea level and warm climate of the Cretaceous meant large areas of
the continents were covered by warm, shallow seas, providing habitat for many
marine organisms. The Cretaceous was named for the extensive chalk deposits of
this age in Europe, but in many parts of the world, the deposits from the
Cretaceous are of marine limestone, a rock type that is formed under warm,
shallow marine circumstances. Due to the high sea level, there was extensive
space for such sedimentation. Because of the relatively young age and great
thickness of the system, Cretaceous rocks are evident in many areas worldwide.

>>

>> Chalk is a rock type characteristic for (but not restricted to) the
Cretaceous. It consists of coccoliths, microscopically small calcite skeletons
of coccolithophores, a type of algae that prospered in the Cretaceous seas.

>>

>> In northwestern Europe, chalk deposits from the Upper Cretaceous are
characteristic for the Chalk Group, which forms the white cliffs of Dover on
the south coast of England and similar cliffs on the French Normandian coast.
The group is found in England, northern France, the low countries, northern
Germany, Denmark and in the subsurface of the southern part of the North Sea.
Chalk is not easily consolidated and the Chalk Group still consists of loose
sediments in many places. The group also has other limestones and arenites.
Among the fossils it contains are sea urchins, belemnites, ammonites and sea
reptiles such as _Mosasaurus_.

>>

>> In southern Europe, the Cretaceous is usually a marine system consisting of
competent limestone beds or incompetent marls. Because the Alpine mountain
chains did not yet exist in the Cretaceous, these deposits formed on the
southern edge of the European continental shelf, at the margin of the Tethys
Ocean.

>>

>> Stagnation of deep sea currents in middle Cretaceous times caused anoxic
conditions in the sea water leaving the deposited organic matter undecomposed.
Half the worlds petroleum reserves were laid down at this time in the anoxic
conditions of what would become the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Mexico. In
many places around the world, dark anoxic shales were formed during this
interval.[7] These shales are an important source rock for oil and gas, for
example in the subsurface of the North Sea.

>>

>> ## Paleogeography[edit]

>>

>> During the Cretaceous, the late-Paleozoic-to-early-Mesozoic supercontinent
of Pangaea completed its tectonic breakup into the present-day continents,
although their positions were substantially different at the time. As the
Atlantic Ocean widened, the convergent-margin mountain building (orogenies)
that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera,
as the Nevadan orogeny was followed by the Sevier and Laramide orogenies.

>> Geography of the Contiguous United States in the late Cretaceous period

>>

>> Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous, it
broke up as South America, Antarctica and Australia rifted away from Africa
(though India and Madagascar remained attached to each other); thus, the South
Atlantic and Indian Oceans were newly formed. Such active rifting lifted great
undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising eustatic sea levels
worldwide. To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow. Broad
shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior
Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine
deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous
transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged.[8]

>>

>> The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in
the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic.[9] Mid-ocean ridge
activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged
ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as
well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous
nanoplankton.[10] These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits
make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North
America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member
and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other
important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe (e.g., the Weald) and China
(the Yixian Formation). In the area that is now India, massive lava beds
called the Deccan Traps were erupted in the very late Cretaceous and early
Paleocene.

>>

>> ## Climate[edit]

>>

>> The cooling trend of the last epoch of the Jurassic continued into the
first age of the Cretaceous. There is evidence that snowfalls were common in
the higher latitudes and the tropics became wetter than during the Triassic
and Jurassic.[11] Glaciation was however restricted to high-latitude
mountains, though seasonal snow may have existed farther from the poles.
Rafting by ice of stones into marine environments occurred during much of the
Cretaceous but evidence of deposition directly from glaciers is limited to the
Early Cretaceous of the Eromanga Basin in southern Australia.[12][13]

>>

>> After the end of the first age, however, temperatures increased again, and
these conditions were almost constant until the end of the period.[11] The
warming may have been due to intense volcanic activity which produced large
quantities of carbon dioxide. Between 70–69 Ma and 66–65 Ma, isotopic ratios
indicate elevated atmospheric CO2 pressures with levels of 1000–1400 ppmV and
mean annual temperatures in west Texas between 21 and 23 °C (70-73 °F).
Atmospheric CO2 and temperature relations indicate a doubling of pCO2 was
accompanied by a ~0.6 °C increase in temperature.[14] The production of large
quantities of magma, variously attributed to mantle plumes or to extensional
tectonics,[15] further pushed sea levels up, so that large areas of the
continental crust were covered with shallow seas. The Tethys Sea connecting
the tropical oceans east to west also helped to warm the global climate. Warm-
adapted plant fossils are known from localities as far north as Alaska and
Greenland, while dinosaur fossils have been found within 15 degrees of the
Cretaceous south pole.[16]

>>

>> Nonetheless, there is evidence of Antarctic marine glaciation in the
Turonian Age.[17]

>>

>> A very gentle temperature gradient from the equator to the poles meant
weaker global winds, which drive the ocean currents, resulted in less
upwelling and more stagnant oceans than today. This is evidenced by widespread
black shale deposition and frequent anoxic events.[7] Sediment cores show that
tropical sea surface temperatures may have briefly been as warm as 42 °C (108
°F), 17 °C (31 °F) warmer than at present, and that they averaged around 37 °C
(99 °F). Meanwhile, deep ocean temperatures were as much as 15 to 20 °C (27 to
36 °F) warmer than today's.[18][19]

>> ### Flora[edit]

>>

>> Although the first representatives of leafy trees and true grasses emerged
in the Cretaceous, the flora was still dominated by conifers like _Araucaria_
(Here: Modern _Araucaria araucana_ in Chile).

>>

>> Flowering plants (angiosperms) spread during this period[20], although they
did not become predominant until the Campanian Age near the end of the period.
Their evolution was aided by the appearance of bees; in fact angiosperms and
insects are a good example of coevolution. The first representatives of many
leafy trees, including figs, planes and magnolias, appeared in the Cretaceous.

>>

>> At the same time, some earlier Mesozoic gymnosperms continued to thrive;
pehuéns (monkey puzzle trees, _Araucaria_ ) and other conifers being notably
plentiful and widespread. Some fern orders such as Gleicheniales appeared as
early in the fossil record as the Cretaceous and achieved an early broad
distribution.[21] Gymnosperm taxa like Bennettitales and hirmerellan conifers
died out before the end of the period.[22]

>>

>> ### Terrestrial fauna[edit]

>>

>> On land, mammals were generally small sized, but a very relevant component
of the fauna, with cimolodont multituberculates outnumbering dinosaurs in some
sites.[23] Neither true marsupials nor placentals existed until the very
end,[24] but a variety of non-marsupial metatherians and non-placental
eutherians had already begun to diversify greatly, ranging as carnivores
(Deltatheroida), aquatic foragers (Stagodontidae) and herbivores (
_Schowalteria_ , Zhelestidae). Various "archaic" groups like eutriconodonts
were common in the Early Cretaceous, but by the Late Cretaceous northern
mammalian faunas were dominated by multituberculates and therians, with
dryolestoids dominating South America.

>>

>> The apex predators were archosaurian reptiles, especially dinosaurs, which
were at their most diverse stage. Pterosaurs were common in the early and
middle Cretaceous, but as the Cretaceous proceeded they declined for poorly
understood reasons (once thought to be due to competition with early birds,
but now it is understood avian adaptive radiation is not consistent with
pterosaur decline[25]), and by the end of the period only two highly
specialized families remained.

>>

>> The Liaoning lagerstätte (Chaomidianzi formation) in China is a treasure
chest of preserved remains of numerous types of small dinosaurs, birds and
mammals, that provides a glimpse of life in the Early Cretaceous. The
coelurosaur dinosaurs found there represent types of the group Maniraptora,
which is transitional between dinosaurs and birds, and are notable for the
presence of hair-like feathers.

>>

>> Insects diversified during the Cretaceous, and the oldest known ants,
termites and some lepidopterans, akin to butterflies and moths, appeared.
Aphids, grasshoppers and gall wasps appeared.[26]

>> ### Marine fauna[edit]

>>

>> In the seas, rays, modern sharks and teleosts became common.[27] Marine
reptiles included ichthyosaurs in the early and mid-Cretaceous (becoming
extinct during the late Cretaceous Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event),
plesiosaurs throughout the entire period, and mosasaurs appearing in the Late
Cretaceous.

>>

>> _Baculites_ , an ammonite genus with a straight shell, flourished in the
seas along with reef-building rudist clams. The Hesperornithiformes were
flightless, marine diving birds that swam like grebes. Globotruncanid
Foraminifera and echinoderms such as sea urchins and starfish (sea stars)
thrived. The first radiation of the diatoms (generally siliceous shelled,
rather than calcareous) in the oceans occurred during the Cretaceous;
freshwater diatoms did not appear until the Miocene.[26] The Cretaceous was
also an important interval in the evolution of bioerosion, the production of
borings and scrapings in rocks, hardgrounds and shells.

Impact_event.jpg)

>>

>> The impact of a meteorite or comet is today widely accepted as the main
reason for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

>>

>> Main article: Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event

>>

>> The impact of a large body with the Earth may have been the punctuation
mark at the end of a progressive decline in biodiversity during the
Maastrichtian Age of the Cretaceous Period. The result was the extinction of
three-quarters of Earth's plant and animal species. The impact created the
sharp break known as K–Pg boundary (formerly known as the K–T boundary).
Earth's biodiversity required substantial time to recover from this event,
despite the probable existence of an abundance of vacant ecological
niches.[28]

>>

>> Despite the severity of K-Pg extinction event, there was significant
variability in the rate of extinction between and within different clades.
Species which depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as
atmospheric particles blocked solar energy. As is the case today,
photosynthesizing organisms, such as phytoplankton and land plants, formed the
primary part of the food chain in the late Cretaceous, and all else that
depended on them suffered as well. Herbivorous animals, which depended on
plants and plankton as their food, died out as their food sources became
scarce; consequently, the top predators such as _Tyrannosaurus rex_ also
perished.[29] Yet only three major groups of tetrapods disappeared completely;
the non-avian dinosaurs, the plesiosaurs and the pterosaurs. The other
Cretaceous groups that did not survive into the Cenozoic era, the ichthyosaurs
and last remaining temnospondyls and non-mammalian cynodonts were already
extinct millions of years before the event occurred. [ _citation needed_ ]

>>

>> Coccolithophorids and molluscs, including ammonites, rudists, freshwater
snails and mussels, as well as organisms whose food chain included these shell
builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought
that ammonites were the principal food of mosasaurs, a group of giant marine
reptiles that became extinct at the boundary.[30]

>>

>> Omnivores, insectivores and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event,
perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. At the
end of the Cretaceous there seem to have been no purely herbivorous or
carnivorous mammals. Mammals and birds which survived the extinction fed on
insects, larvae, worms and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal
matter. Scientists theorise that these organisms survived the collapse of
plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus.[31][28][32]

>>

>> In stream communities, few groups of animals became extinct. Stream
communities rely less on food from living plants and more on detritus that
washes in from land. This particular ecological niche buffered them from
extinction.[33] Similar, but more complex patterns have been found in the
oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the water column,
than among animals living on or in the seafloor. Animals in the water column
are almost entirely dependent on primary production from living phytoplankton,
while animals living on or in the ocean floor feed on detritus or can switch
to detritus feeding.[28]

>>

>> The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, crocodilians and
champsosaurs, were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus. Modern
crocodilians can live as scavengers and can survive for months without food
and go into hibernation when conditions are unfavorable, and their young are
small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or
fragments of organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have
been linked to crocodilian survival at the end of the Cretaceous.[31]
