Nearly half of all US medical care is delivered by emergency departments,
according to a new study by researchers at the University of Maryland School
of Medicine (UMSOM). And in recent years, the percentage of care delivered by
emergency departments has grown. The paper highlights the major role played by
emergency care in health care in the U.S.

"I was stunned by the results. This really helps us better understand health
care in this country. This research underscores the fact that emergency
departments are critical to our nation's healthcare delivery system." said
David Marcozzi, an associate professor in the UMSOM Department of Emergency
Medicine, and co-director of the UMSOM Program in Health Disparities and
Population Health. "Patients seek care in emergency departments for many
reasons. The data might suggest that emergency care provides the type of care
that individuals actually want or need, 24 hours a day."

Although he now focuses on population health, Dr. Marcozzi is an emergency
room doctor himself, and works one or two days a week in the University of
Maryland Medical Center emergency department, treating patients.

This is the first study to quantify the contribution of emergency department
care to overall U.S. health care. The paper appears in the latest issue of
_International Journal for Health Services_.

For this study, Dr. Marcozzi and his colleagues examined publicly available
data from several national healthcare databases, which covered all 50 states
and the District of Columbia. They studied the period between 1996 and 2010.

For 2010, the most recent your study, the study found that there were nearly
130 million emergency department visits, compared with almost 101 million
outpatient visits and nearly 39 million inpatient visits. Inpatient visits
typically involve a hospital stay, but are planned ahead, as opposed to
emergency department visits, which are generally at least somewhat unexpected.

Over the 14-year period of the study, more than 3.5 billion health care
contacts -- emergency department visits, outpatient visits, and hospital
admissions took place. Over that time, emergency care visits increased by
nearly 44 percent. Outpatient visits accounted for nearly 38 percent of
contacts. Inpatient care accounted for almost 15 percent of visits.

Certain groups were significantly more likely to use the emergency department
as their method of healthcare. African-American patients were significantly
more likely to have emergency department visits than patients in other racial
groups; patients in the "other" insurance category, which includes those
without any type of insurance, were significantly more likely to have
emergency department visits than any other group. And patients living in the
South were significantly more likely to have emergency department visits than
patients living in other areas of the country.

African-American patients used emergency departments at a higher rate than
other groups. In 2010, this group used the emergency department almost 54
percent of the time. The rate was even higher for urban African-American
patients, who used emergency care 59 percent of the time that year. Emergency
department use rates in south and west were 54 percent and 56 percent,
respectively. In the northeast, use was much lower, 39 percent of all visits.

Certain groups accounted for increasing percentages of overall emergency room
use: African-Americans, Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, residents of the
south and west, and women. Dr. Marcozzi says that these findings point to
increasing use by vulnerable populations, which is no surprise since
socioeconomic and racial inequality creates barriers to the use health care.

The use of emergency care resources for non-emergency cases has been
controversial, since initial emergency care patients often end up being seen
for non-emergency medical issues. Some experts argue that emergency
departments are covering for deficiencies in inpatient and outpatient
resources, and for a lack of effective prevention strategies. This could
contribute to the high rate of emergency department use. They argue that
emergency room use should be reduced.

Dr. Marcozzi says this is unlikely to happen anytime soon, given the structure
of the country's health care system. He also notes that it may not be the best
option. Instead, he says we should work to connect the care delivered in
emergency departments with care delivered by the rest of the healthcare
system.
