Trained as a nurse and midwife in New York’s Lower East Side gritty slums,
Margaret Sanger grew aware of the dangers of unplanned pregnancy—both physical
and psychological. Sanger ignited a movement that has shaped our society to
this day. Her views on reproductive rights have made her a frequent target of
conservatives and moral zealots.

In this captivating new biography, the renowned feminist historian Jean H.
Baker rescues Sanger from such critiques and restores her to the vaunted place
in history she once held.

## United States Citizenship Categories and Definitions

# United States Citizenship Categories and Definitions

_**Truthmonk**_

> A _citizen_ (noun) is a legally recognized individual member of a state or
commonwealth, who owes allegiance to a government, is entitled to protection
from it, and has the rights to political participation in it.

>

> _Citizenship_ (noun) is the status of being a citizen with its attendant
duties, rights, and privileges.

## Two Categories of Citizenships

There are two categories of citizenship:[1]

    
        1. Natural born
    2. Naturalized
    

### Natural Born

_Natural born_ citizenship is the acquirement of citizenship at the moment of
birth.[2]

There are only two types of natural born citizen:

    
        1. _Native-born_ is being born within the territory of the state or commonwealth under the principle of _jus soli,_
    2. Attaining citizenship through the parents' citizenship status under the principle of _jus sanguinis_.
    

**Jus Soli**

The principle of birthright citizenship gained through being born within a
country is called _jus soli_ (Latin for “right of soil”). It isn 't dependent
on the citizenship of the parents.[2]

In the United States the principle of jus soli goes back to before the
creation of the Constitution. Territorial birthright citizenship was first
formally established under English common law in the 1608 case of Calvin v.
Smith (77 Eng. Rep. 377 (K.B. 1608)) whose decision was based upon the feudal
relationship between a king or lord with their subjects in the early English
feudal system.[3]

The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution confirmed this
birthright citizenship in the pertinent part of Section 1,

> “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State
wherein they reside.” [Note 1]

It has been presumed that any person born within the territory of the United
States, including the children of illegal aliens, are granted citizenship
under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. [2] The only
exception is for foreign diplomats’ and officers’ children.[4 and Note 2]

**Jus Sanguinis**

The other natural born citizenship birthright is called _jus sanguinis_ (Latin
for “right of blood”). Jus sanguinis is based on having an ancestor or parent
(often the father), who is a national or citizen of the state.[2]

Jus sanguinis has even a longer history under English common law than jus
soli. The concept of jus sanguinis dates back to at least 1351 when the
statute de Natis Ultra Mare (25 Edw. 3, Stat. 2 (1351)) was passed. This
statute became necessary due to King Edwards III's overseas military
campaigns. The statute goes beyond just granting citizenship to the children
of those in the King’s service, to include “all children born beyond the sea
whose fathers and mothers were at the faith and ligeance of the king of
England, and provided that the mothers had gone outside the realm with the
permission of their husbands, could inherit, i.e., that they were
subjects.”[5]

The concept of Jus sanguinis did influence the creation of the Constitution in
the United States. The Naturalization Act of 1790 ((1 Stat. 103) March 26,
1790) clarifies this type of natural born citizen by declaring that “the
children of citizens of the United States that may be born beyond Sea, or out
of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural born
Citizens.” Thusly the act establishes the United States citizenship of
citizens’ children, who are born abroad, without the need for
naturalization.[Note 3]

Congress again confirmed jus sanguinis citizenship birthright in the
Naturalization Act of 1795 (January 29, 1795 (1 Stat. 414)) “and the children
of citizens of the United States, born out of the limits and jurisdiction of
the United States, shall be considered as citizens of the United States.”
While this leaves out the term natural-born, it does declare them to be
citizens by-birth through their parents and therefore do not need the process
of naturalization to become citizens.[Note 4]

### Naturalization

The other type of citizenship is through the legal process called
Naturalization.[6] “Naturalization is the process by which U.S. citizenship is
conferred upon a foreign citizen or national after he or she fulfills the
requirements established by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act
(INA). All naturalization applicants must demonstrate good moral character,
attachment, and favorable disposition. The other naturalization requirements
may be modified or waived for certain applicants, such as spouses of U.S.
citizens. The general requirements for administrative naturalization include:

    
        * a period of continuous residence and physical presence in the United States;
    * residence in a particular USCIS District prior to filing;
    * an ability to read, write, and speak English;
    * a knowledge and understanding of U.S. history and government;
    * good moral character;
    * attachment to the principles of the U.S. Constitution; and,
    * favorable disposition toward the United States.”
    

## U.S. Constitution

While the U.S. Constitution requires a person to be a “natural born” Citizen
to qualify for the Office of the President of the United States,

> No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States,
at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the
Office of President,[Note 5]

it doesn’t define what is meant by a “natural born” citizen [6] nor is it
discussed much among the Founding Fathers.

It is well settled law that “native-born” citizens qualify for the Office of
the President because they are “natural-born” and that naturalized citizens do
not qualify.[7] “But whether a person born abroad of American parents, or of
one American and one alien parent, qualifies as natural born has never been
resolved.”

Pryor then goes on to explain, “Constitutional scholars have traditionally
approached the uncertainty surrounding the meaning of the natural-born citizen
clause by inquiring into the specific meaning of the term “natural born” at
the time of the Constitutional Convention. They conclude that a class of
citizens should be considered natural born today only if they would have been
considered natural-born citizens under the law in effect at the time of the
framing of the Constitution.”

The “clarifying” of the Naturalization Act of 1790 would seem to make
birthright by descent a closed topic, however, some scholars see the act as
indicating the “early Congress’ belief in its power to declare who would be
natural-born citizens.” Some scholars believe that congress doesn't have the
authority to define what constitutes natural-born citizenship. An
understanding of the meaning of natural-born can only be realized by
considering the interplay between it and the naturalization powers of
Congress.

This remains a murky area of unsettled law. The U.S. Supreme Court has never
made a ruling on its meaning and has only mentioned the natural-born citizen
clause in dicta.

## Notes

    
        1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

        2. **Mr. HOWARD:** … _This amendment which I have offered is simply declaratory of what I regard as the law of the land already, that every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the United States._ This will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, _but will include every other class of persons._ It settles the great question of citizenship and removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the United States. This has long been a great desideratum in the jurisprudence and legislation of this country. (emphasis added)

The concept of citizenship that achieved full legal form and force in mid-
nineteenth-century America had English roots in the sense that it was the
product of a theoretical and legal development that extended over three
hundred years. The book explains how the circumstances of life in the New
World transformed the quasi-medieval ideas of seventeenth-century English
jurists about subjectship, community, sovereignty, and allegiance into a
wholly new doctrine of "volitional allegiance."

While the central British idea was subjectship that involved a personal
relationship with the king, Americans defined all political allegiance as the
result of a legal contract resting on individual volition and consent that
bind individuals to the community.

Is civic identity in the United States really defined by liberal, democratic
political principles? Or is U.S. citizenship the product of multiple
traditions -- not only liberalism and republicanism but also white supremacy,
Anglo-Saxon supremacy, Protestant supremacy, and male Supremacy? In this
powerful and disturbing book, Rogers Smith traces political struggles over
U.S. citizenship laws from the colonial period through the Progressive era and
shows that throughout this time, most adults were legally denied access to
full citizenship, including political rights, solely because of their race,
ethnicity, or gender. Basic conflicts over these denials have driven political
development and civic membership in the U.S., Smith argues. These conflicts
are what truly define U.S. civic identity up to this day.

Bringing together the most recent scholarship, the book sheds light on how
ideas of citizenship have changed through time from ancient Greece to the
present, looks at concepts such as membership and belonging, and highlights
the relation between citizenship, rights, and democracy. It also examines the
challenges confronting citizenship today, the impact of globalization, the
desirability of "global citizenship," the teaching of citizenship in schools,
citizenship tests for immigrants, and the many different definitions and types
of citizenship in modern society.

For 35 years of my life, I have lived my life as a Natural Born US Citizen.
ALL my legal documents reflected Natural Born (the right way). Today, year 36,
several Naturalized Citizens, to include people who fall under Residence have
mistreated me to such a degree to make me reflect illegal immigrant, my FL
Drivers Lic reflects US Citizen by birth due to the number, but the enblems,
star, format of name reflects something else. The same scenario goes with my
US Passport. My internal pelvic body area has been changed MORE than 50 times
in ONE calendar year. Due to all of this, I deal with people who all have
twins, but me. In conclusion, where should I go to rectify this wrong doing?
Who do I call aside from law enforcement? It has causedva LOT of problems to
me. A lot of discrimination and mistreatment. Thank you for the help on
advance.
