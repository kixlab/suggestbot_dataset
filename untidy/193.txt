# CDCs Abortion Surveillance System FAQs

Minus

Related Pages

When did CDC abortion surveillance start?

CDC began abortion surveillance in 1969 to document the number and
characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions. Many states and
reporting areas (New York City and the District of Columbia) conduct abortion
surveillance. CDC compiles the information these reporting areas collect to
produce national estimates. CDC's surveillance system compiles information on
legal induced abortions only.

How does CDC define abortion?

For the purpose of surveillance, a legal induced abortion is defined as an
intervention performed by a licensed clinician (e.g., a physician, nurse-
midwife, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant) that is intended to
terminate an ongoing pregnancy.

Most states and reporting areas that collect abortion data now report if an
abortion was medical or surgical. Medical abortions are legal procedures that
use medications instead of surgery.

Are states required to report their abortion statistics to CDC?

No, states and areas voluntarily report data to CDC for inclusion in its
annual Abortion Surveillance Report. CDC's Division of Reproductive Health
prepares surveillance reports as data become available. There is no national
requirement for data submission or reporting.

States needing guidance on abortion surveillance may contact CDC at Contact
CDC-INFO.

How is the report prepared and formatted?

Preparation of the Abortion Surveillance Reports is based on the data
available from all states and reporting areas that voluntarily provide this
information for a given calendar year. In addition, after CDC receives the
data some additional time is required to perform the analyses that produce the
tables, charts, and the narrative describing methods and trends. Please view
the abstract and methods portion of the most recent Abortion Surveillance
Report for more information on compilation of the report.

How is the Abortion Surveillance Report used?

This report is used for many purposes in the field of public health. In the
past, it has been used to

    
        * Identify characteristics of women who are at high risk of unintended pregnancy.
    * Evaluate the effectiveness of programs for reducing teen pregnancies and unintended pregnancies among women of all ages.
    * Calculate pregnancy rates, on the basis of the number of pregnancies ending in abortion, in conjunction with birth data and pregnancy loss estimates.
    * Monitor changes in clinical practice patterns related to abortion, such as changes in the types of procedures used, and weeks of gestation at the time of abortion. This information is needed to calculate the mortality rate of specific abortion procedures.
    

Surveillance systems, such as this one, continue to provide data necessary to
examine trends in public health.

Are data available for my own analysis?

In addition to the data available in the annual Abortion Surveillance Report,
data from 2009 to 2015 Cdc-excel[XLS - 367 KB] also are available for
abortions distributed by state of maternal residence and state of clinical
service. These data are consistent with data reported to CDC for each year's
Abortion Surveillance Report. No additional data are available for public use.
Search the National Library of Medicine's _MEDLINE/PubMed External_ or
_MedlinePlus External_ bibliographic reference for other abortion data.

Abortion Surveillance--Findings and Reports

**Abortion Surveillance --Findings and Reports**

Abortion Surveillance 2015

In 2015, 638,169 legal induced abortions were reported to CDC from 49
reporting areas. The abortion rate for 2015 was 11.8 abortions per 1,000 women
aged 15-44 years, and the abortion ratio was 188 abortions per 1,000 live
births.

Compared with 2014, the total number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions
for 2015 decreased 2%. Additionally, from 2006 to 2015, the number, rate, and
ratio of reported abortions decreased 24%, 26%, and 19%, respectively. In
2015, all three measures reached their lowest level for the entire period of
analysis (2006--2015).

Women in their twenties accounted for the majority of abortions in 2015 and
throughout the period of analysis. The majority of abortions in 2015 took
place early in gestation: 91.1% of abortions were performed at ≤13 weeks'
gestation; a smaller number of abortions (7.6%) were performed at 14-20 weeks'
gestation, and even fewer (1.3%) were performed at ≥21 weeks' gestation. In
2015, 24.6% of all abortions were early medical abortions (a non-surgical
abortion at ≤8 weeks' gestation). The percentage of abortions reported as
early medical abortions increased 114% from 2006 to 2015, with an 8% increase
from 2014 to 2015. Source: Abortion Surveillance -- United States, 2015. MMWR
