# Did a New Study Officially Declare That Fluoride Is a Neurotoxin?

## A controversial paper from 2014 continues to be shared as evidence that

fluoride has "officially" been declared a neurotoxin; that’s not how it works.

### Origin

Since at least December 2015, several effectively identical stories about the
neurotoxicity of fluoride have been published on a wide variety of websites
with domain names like AltHealthworks.com, Energytherapy.biz, Organic and
Healthy.org, and most recently in a 5 April 2018 post from AwarenessAct.com:

> Evidence of how negatively fluoride can impact our health has been
increasing in rapid pace throughout the past few years. People are hoping that
by bringing awareness to this that somehow we can get sodium fluoride removed
from the world’s water supply.

>

> A big step has been made here recently. In the most prestigious medical
journal […] known as The Lancet [,] fluoride has been at last classified as a
neurotoxin one hundred percent. This puts it in the same category as things
like lead, arsenic, and mercury. This news was released by the author Stefan
Smyle who actually cited a report that had been published in The Lancet
Neurology, Volume 13, Issue 3 […] in the March of 2014 edition.

Right off the bat, there are a number of elements that should jump out at the
reader as dubious. First, studies — even ones published in prestigious
journals — do not themselves “declare” or “classify” anything as a neurotoxin;
governmental organizations, using published research and other data, make
determinations about a chemical’s danger and regulate it accordingly.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of
chemicals approved as _non-_ toxic under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and
they regulate standards for levels of human-made and natural contaminants in
water under the Safe Drinking Water Act. For food or cosmetic products, the
Food and Drug Administration makes similar determinations under the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

Second, the concept of classifying something as “one hundred percent”
neurotoxic betrays the original author’s ignorance of the concept of toxicity.
Toxicologists do not refer to toxicity in any way that could be represented as
a percentage, instead they develop exposure guidelines and reference doses.
The dose, as they say, makes the poison, and many things that are legally
allowed to be in food are, in fact, neurotoxic at high enough doses.

For these reasons, the viral claim can be debunked as false without even
getting into the _Lancet Neurology_ paper cited in these stories. However,
since that paper continues to be attached to these viral click traps, it is
worth noting that the study itself included no new analyses about the
neurotoxicity of fluoride.

**The _Lancet Neurology_ Paper**

Though presented as a large-scale study revealing new toxicologic information
about fluoride, this paper (which was in _Lancet Neurology,_ not _The Lancet_
) introduced no new data on fluoride neurotoxicity. It instead makes a broader
argument that all chemicals should be considered __ neurotoxic to children
given science’s inability to accurately or effectively assess neurotoxicity to
developing brains, citing past research on fluoride as one example of a
potentially harmful chemical:

> To control the pandemic of developmental neurotoxicity, we propose a global
prevention strategy. Untested chemicals should not be presumed to be safe to
brain development, and chemicals in existing use and all new chemicals must
therefore be tested for developmental neurotoxicity.

The paper itself drew fierce criticism from scientists in both industry and
academia when it was first published, and _Lancet Neurology_ ended up
publishing an unusually large of number of professional responses to the
study. Authored by Harvard School of Public Health professor Philippe
Grandjean and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Professor Philip J.
Landrigan, this 2014 paper is a follow up an earlier paper written by the same
authors that incorporates new studies that had been conducted since then.

The entirety of new information about fluoride in the 2014 iteration of their
work boils down to a single new study — a meta-review of 27 smaller scale
studies published in a 2012 paper which also included Grandjean as an author.
It also drew significant academic backlash and media attention. The paper was
so misrepresented by some media accounts hailing it as rock-solid evidence
that water fluoridation reduces the intelligence of children that the authors
actually had to append a clarification notice to the press release sent out by
Harvard, stating their results could not be used to assess the levels at which
fluoride could become neurotoxic:

> These results do not allow us to make any judgment regarding possible levels
of risk at levels of exposure typical for water fluoridation in the U.S. On
the other hand, neither can it be concluded that no risk is present. We
therefore recommend further research to clarify what role fluoride exposure
levels may play in possible adverse effects on brain development, so that
future risk assessments can properly take into regard this possible hazard.

The reason that this study can not be used to draw a direct comparison the
United States or to water fluoridation programs in general is because most of
the studies are from China and utilize the natural variations of fluoride in
groundwater, which is found in high concentration in some regions there. In
many cases, the studies analyzed in the 2012 review investigate extremely high
concentrations of fluoride that far exceed legal limits in the United States.

**The Fluoride Argument**

Further — and despite assurances by Grandjean and Landrigan to the contrary —
many of the studies included in the 2012 review (which were translated from
Chinese and republished in the journal _Fluoride_ years after their original
publication) do not provide anywhere near enough information to defend the
claim that their documented associations between exposure to fluoride and
reduced IQ are “unlikely” to be driven by another chemical in drinking water
(such as arsenic) that could also have a neurologic effect. For a more
detailed look at the criticisms of that 2012 study, please see our post on
claims that water fluoridation can reduce a person’s intelligence quotient.

A better study to reference if one were interested in providing an argument
that fluoride could have cognitive effects on developing brains would be a
2017 paper published in _Environmental Health Perspectives_ , which
demonstrates an association between prenatal fluoride exposure and reduced IQ
in mother-offspring pairs in Mexico. This study, like many in the review
described above, is not great for comparisons to United States water
fluoridation, however. That’s because the mother-offspring pairs in this 2017
study were exposed either to naturally occurring fluoride or through fluoride
added to salt, not to water. It therefore cannot be used confidently to assess
the levels at which fluoride in drinking water could be neurotoxic to
developing brains:

> Our findings, combined with evidence from existing animal and human studies,
reinforce the need for additional research on potential adverse effects of
fluoride, particularly in pregnant women and children, and to ensure that the
benefits of population-level fluoride supplementation outweigh any potential
risks.

These preliminary findings aside, the 2014 study referenced in viral posts did
not “officially declare” anything about fluoride, as it and the authors that
created it have no authority to do so. It instead made a controversial
argument for a more proactive approach to chemical regulation using old and
potentially flawed data about fluoride. For all these reasons, we rank the
claim that a new paper in _The Lancet_ has ruled that fluoride is a neurotoxin
as false.
