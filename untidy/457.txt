# The 10 Most Overpopulated Cities

__0

By Staff Reports on July 14, 2014 World News

MADISON, Wis. — A contributing factor to the endless cycle of poverty is
overpopulation. When a city has too many people, the resources become
stretched and access to them becomes limited. Most of this over-population is
occurring in the developing world. Of the 28 biggest cities, only six are in
the developed world.

Here are the 10 most overpopulated cities in the world:

### 10. Guangzhou, China
