**Crime in the United States** has been recorded since colonization. Crime
rates have varied over time, with a sharp rise after 1963, reaching a broad
peak between the 1970s and early 1990s. Since then, crime has declined
significantly in the United States,[1] and current crime rates are
approximately the same as those of the 1960s.[2]

Statistics on specific crimes are indexed in the annual Uniform Crime Reports
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and by annual National Crime
Victimization Surveys by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.[3] In addition to
the primary Uniform Crime Report known as _Crime in the United States_ , the
FBI publishes annual reports on the status of law enforcement in the United
States.[2] The report's definitions of specific crimes are considered standard
by many American law enforcement agencies.[4] According to the FBI, index
crime in the United States includes violent crime and property crime.[5]
Violent crime consists of four criminal offenses: murder and non-negligent
manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; property crime consists
of burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson.[5]

In the long term, violent crime in the United States has been in decline since
colonial times. The homicide rate has been estimated to be over 30 per 100,000
people in 1700, dropping to under 20 by 1800, and to under 10 by 1900.[6]

After World War II, crime rates increased in the United States, peaking from
the 1970s to the early-1990s. Violent crime nearly quadrupled between 1960 and
its peak in 1991. Property crime more than doubled over the same period. Since
the 1990s, however, contrary to common misconception,[7] crime in the United
States has declined steadily. Several theories have been proposed to explain
this decline:

  * The number of police officers increased considerably in the 1990s.[8]
  * On September 16, 1994, President Bill Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act into law. Under the act, over $30 billion in federal aid was spent over a six-year period to improve state and local law enforcement, prisons and crime prevention programs.[9] Proponents of the law, including the President, touted it as a lead contributor to the sharp drop in crime which occurred throughout the 1990s,[9] while critics have dismissed it as an unprecedented federal boondoggle.[9]
  * The prison population has rapidly increased since the mid-1970s.[8]
  * Starting in the mid-1980s, the crack-cocaine market grew rapidly before declining again a decade later. Some authors have pointed towards the link between violent crimes and crack use.[8]
  * Legalized abortion reduced the number of children born to mothers in difficult circumstances, and difficult childhood makes children more likely to become criminals.[10]
  * The changing demographics of an aging population has been cited for the drop in overall crime.[11]
  * Rising income[12]
  * The introduction of the data-driven policing practice CompStat significantly reduced crimes in cities that adopted it.[12]
  * The lead-crime hypothesis suggests reduced lead exposure as the cause; Scholar Mark A.R. Kleiman writes: "Given the decrease in lead exposure among children since the 1980s and the estimated effects of lead on crime, reduced lead exposure could easily explain a very large proportion—certainly more than half—of the crime decrease of the 1994-2004 period. A careful statistical study relating local changes in lead exposure to local crime rates estimates the fraction of the crime decline due to lead reduction as greater than 90 percent.[13]
  * The quality and extent of use of security technology both increased around the time of the crime decline, after which the rate of car theft declined; this may have caused rates of other crimes to decline as well.[14]
  * Increased rates of immigration to the United States[15][16]

### Arrests[edit]

Each state has a set of statutes enforceable within its own borders. A state
has no jurisdiction outside of its borders, even though still in the United
States. It must request extradition from the state in which the suspect has
fled. In 2014, there were 186,873 felony suspects outside specific states
jurisdiction against whom no extradition would be sought. Philadelphia has
about 20,000 of these since it is near a border with four other states.
Extradition is estimated to cost a few hundred dollars per case.[19]

Further information: Race and crime in the United States

For 2012, law enforcement made approximately 12,200,000 arrests nationally,
down 200,000 from 2011.[20][21] Arrested offenders in the United States tend
to be male,[22][23] over age 18,[24][25] and white, mirroring the general
population. Based on a comparison with race and ethnicity data from the 2010
Census, blacks are arrested for more crimes than average, Native Americans are
arrested for slightly more crimes than average, whites are arrested for
slightly fewer crimes than average, and Asians and Pacific Islanders are
arrested for fewer crimes than average.[26][27]

US homicide convictions by race, 1980–2008[30]

Characteristics of offenders vary from the average for specific types of
crimes and specific crimes. In terms of violent crime by gender, in 2011,
80.4% of arrested persons were male and 19.6% were female.[23] Males were
88.2% of those arrested for homicide, while females were 11.8%.[23] Among
those arrested for rape in 2011, males were 98.8% and females were 1.2%.[23]
For property crime in 2011, 62.9% of arrested persons were male and 37.1% were
female.[23]

For violent crime by race in 2011, 59.4% of those arrested were white, 38.3%
were black, and 2.2% were of other races.[27] For persons arrested for
homicide in 2011, 49.7% were black, 48% were white, and 2.3% were of other
races.[27] For persons arrested for rape in 2011, 65% were white, 32.9% were
black, and 2.1% were of other races.[27] For property crime in 2011, 68.1% of
arrested persons were white, 29.5% were black, and 2.4% were of other
races.[27]

In 2011, law enforcement reported 6,222 bias-motivated incidents, known as
hate crimes, for which 5,731 offenders were identified.[31] Of these, 59% were
white, 20.9% were black, 7.1% were of various races, 1.4% were Asian or
Pacific Islanders, 0.8% were Native American, and 10.8% were of unknown
race.[31]

Reporting at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association
(August 3, 2008), sociologists at Bowling Green State University found that
men who attend college are more likely to commit property crimes during their
college years than their non-college-attending peers. The research draws from
three waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
and examines education, crime levels, substance abuse and socializing among
adolescents and young adults.[32] Also, according to Naci Mocan of the
University of Colorado and Erdal Tekin of Georgia State University, "We find
that unattractive individuals commit more crime in comparison to average-
looking ones, and very attractive individuals commit less crime in comparison
to those who are average-looking."[33]

## Crime victimology[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/United_States_homicide_victimization_rates_by_race_1980_2008.svg/400px-

United_States_homicide_victimization_rates_by_race_1980_2008.svg.png)

This graph shows the homicide victimization rate for whites and blacks,
according to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics.[30]

In 2011, surveys indicated more than 5.8 million violent victimizations and
17.1 million property victimizations took place in the United States;
according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, each property victimization
corresponded to one household, while violent victimizations is the number of
victims of a violent crime.[34]

Patterns are found within the victimology of crime in the United States.
Overall, males, people with lower incomes, those younger than 25, and non-
whites were more likely to report being the victim of crime.[34] Income,
gender, and age had the most dramatic effect on the chances of a person being
victimized by crime, while the characteristic of race depended upon the crime
being committed.[34]

In terms of gender, males were more likely to become crime victims than were
females,[35] with 79% percent of all murder victims being male. Males were
twice as likely to be carjacked as females.[35] In terms of income, households
with a 2008 income of less than $15,000 were significantly more likely to have
their homes burglarized.[35]

Concerning age, those younger than twenty-five were more likely to fall victim
to crime, especially violent crime.[36] The chances of being victimized by
violent crime decreased far more substantially with age than the chances of
becoming the victim of property crime.[36] For example, 3.03% of crimes
committed against a young person were theft, while 20% of crimes committed
against an elderly person were theft.[36]

Bias motivation reports showed that of the 7,254 hate crimes reported in 2011,
47.7% (3,465) were motivated by race, with 72% (2,494) of race-motivated
incidents being anti-black.[31] In addition, 20.8% (1,508) of hate crimes were
motivated by sexual orientation, with 57.8% (871) of orientation-motivated
incidents being anti-male homosexual.[31] The third largest motivation factor
for hate crime was religion, representing 18.2% (1,318) incidents, with 62.2%
(820) of religion-motivated incidents being anti-Jewish.[31]

As of 2007, violent crime against homeless people is increasing.[37][38] The
rate of such documented crimes in 2005 was 30% higher than of those in
1999.[39] 75% of all perpetrators are under the age of 25. Studies and surveys
indicate that homeless people have a much higher criminal victimization rate
than the non-homeless, but that most incidents never get reported to
authorities.[ _citation needed_ ] In recent years, largely due to the efforts
of the National Coalition for the Homeless (NCH) and academic researchers the
problem of violence against the homeless has gained national attention. The
NCH called deliberate attacks against the homeless hate crimes in their report
_Hate, Violence, and Death on Mainstreet USA_ (they retain the definition of
the American Congress). [ _citation needed_ ] The _Center for the Study of
Hate & Extremism_ at California State University, San Bernardino in
conjunction with the NCH found that 155 homeless people were killed by non-
homeless people in "hate killings", while 76 people were killed in all the
other traditional hate crime homicide categories such as race and religion,
combined.[38] The CSHE contends that negative and degrading portrayals of the
homeless contribute to a climate where violence takes place.

The likelihood of falling victim to crime relates to both demographic and
geographic characteristics.[1] Overall, men, minorities, the young, and those
in urban areas are more likely to be crime victims.[1] The likelihood of
perpetrating crime also relates to demography.

In 2010, according to the UNODC, 67.5% of all homicides in the United States
were perpetrated using a firearm.[40] The costliest crime in terms of impact
on victims, and the most underreported crime is rape, in the United
States.[41][42]

_Felony Sentences in State Courts_ , study by the United States Department of
Justice.

The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world (which
includes pre-trial detainees and sentenced prisoners).[43] As of 2009, 2.3
million people were incarcerated in the United States, including federal and
state prisons and local jails, creating an incarceration rate of 793 persons
per 100,000 of national population.[43] During 2011, 1.6 million people were
incarcerated under the jurisdiction of federal and state authorities.[44] At
the end of 2011, 492 persons per 100,000 U.S. residents were incarcerated in
federal and state prisons.[44] Of the 1.6 million state and federal prisoners,
nearly 1.4 million people were under state jurisdiction, while 215,000 were
under federal jurisdiction.[44] Demographically, nearly 1.5 million prisoners
were male, and 115,000 were female, while 581,000 prisoners were black,
516,000 were white, and 350,000 were Hispanic.[44]

Among the 1.35 million sentenced state prisoners in 2011, 725,000 people were
incarcerated for violent crimes, 250,000 were incarcerated for property
crimes, 237,000 people were incarcerated for drug crimes, and 150,000 were
incarcerated for other offenses.[44] Of the 200,000 sentenced federal
prisoners in 2011, 95,000 were incarcerated for drug crimes, 69,000 were
incarcerated for public order offenses, 15,000 were incarcerated for violent
crimes, and 11,000 were incarcerated for property crimes.[44]

## International comparison[edit]

The manner in which America's crime rate compared to other countries of
similar wealth and development depends on the nature of the crime used in the
comparison.[45] Overall crime statistic comparisons are difficult to conduct,
as the definition and categorization of crimes varies across countries. Thus
an agency in a foreign country may include crimes in its annual reports which
the United States omits, and vice versa.

However, some countries such as Canada have similar definitions of what
constitutes a violent crime, and nearly all countries had the same definition
of the characteristics that constitutes a homicide.[ _citation needed_ ]
Overall the total crime rate of the United States is higher than developed
countries, specifically Europe, with South American countries and Russia being
the exceptions.[46] Some types of reported property crime in the U.S. survey
as lower than in Germany or Canada, yet the homicide rate in the United States
is substantially higher as is the prison population.

### Violent crime[edit]

See also: Violent crime in the United States, Gun violence in the United
States, List of U.S. states by homicide rate, and List of countries by
intentional homicide rate by decade

The reported U.S. violent crime rate includes murder, rape and sexual assault,
robbery, and assault,[47] whereas the Canadian violent crime rate includes all
categories of assault, including Assault level 1 (i.e., assault not using a
weapon and not resulting in serious bodily harm).[48][49] A Canadian
government study concluded that direct comparison of the 2 countries' violent
crime totals or rates was "inappropriate".[50]

France does not count minor violence such as punching or slapping as assault,
whereas Austria, Germany, and Finland do count such occurrences.[51]

The United Kingdom similarly has different definitions of what constitutes
violent crime compared to the United States, making a direct comparison of the
overall figure flawed. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports defines a “violent
crime” as one of four specific offenses: murder and non-negligent
manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. The British Home
Office, by contrast, has a different definition of violent crime, including
all “crimes against the person,” including simple assaults, all robberies, and
all “sexual offenses,” as opposed to the FBI, which only counts aggravated
assaults and “forcible rapes.”[52]

Crime rates are necessarily altered by averaging neighborhood higher or lower
local rates over a larger population which includes the entire city. Having
small pockets of dense crime may lower a city's average crime rate.

Violent crime rates per 100,000 population, 2013 Country | Murder and non-
negligent  
manslaughter (intentional homicide) | Rape | Robbery | Aggravated  
assault  
\---|---|---|---|---  
Austria | 0.73 | 9 | 61 | 47  
Germany | 0.77 | 9 | 64 | 88  
England/Wales | 0.92 | 18 | 157 | -  
Scotland | 1.15 | 20 | 60 | 117  
USA | 4.5 | 26.8 | 113 | 241

#### Homicide[edit]

See also: List of countries by intentional homicide rate

According to a 2013 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
(UNODC), between 2005 and 2012[update], the average homicide rate in the U.S.
was 4.9 per 100,000 inhabitants compared to the average rate globally, which
was 6.2. However, the U.S. had much higher murder rates compared to other
countries identified in the report as "developed", which all had average
homicide rates of 0.8 per 100,000.[46] In 2004, there were 5.5 homicides for
every 100,000 persons, roughly three times as high as Canada (1.9) and six
times as high as Germany and Italy (0.9).[53][48] A closer look at The
National Archive of Criminal Justice Data indicates that _per capita_ homicide
rates over the last 30 plus years on average, of major cities, New Orleans'
average annual _per capita_ homicide rate of 52 murders per 100,000 people
overall (1980–2012) is the highest of U.S. cities with average annual homicide
totals that were among the top 10 highest during the same period.

Country | Singapore | Iceland | Armenia | United States | Moldova | South
Sudan | Panama  
\---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Homicide rate (per hundred thousand) in 2012  
(international methodology)[46] | 0.2 | 0.5 | 1.7 | 5.1 | 5.2 | 12 | 53.1

In the United States, the number of homicides where the victim and offender
relationship was undetermined has been increasing since 1999 but has not
reached the levels experienced in the early 1990s. In 14% of all murders, the
victim and the offender were strangers. Spouses and family members made up
about 15% of all victims, about one-third of the victims were acquaintances of
the assailant, and the victim and offender relationship was undetermined in
over one-third of homicides. Gun involvement in homicides were gang-related
homicides which increased after 1980, homicides that occurred during the
commission of a felony which increased from 55% in 1985 to 77% in 2005,
homicides resulting from arguments which declined to the lowest levels
recorded recently, and homicides resulting from other circumstances which
remained relatively constant. Because gang killing has become a normal part of
inner cities, many including police hold preconceptions about the causes of
death in inner cities. When a death is labeled gang-related it lowers the
chances that it will be investigated and increases the chances that the
perpetrator will remain at large. In addition, victims of gang killings often
determine the priority a case will be given by police. Jenkins (1988) argues
that many serial murder cases remain unknown to police and that cases
involving Black offenders and victims are especially likely to escape official
attention.[54]

According to the FBI, "When the race of the offender was known, 53.0 percent
were black, 44.7 percent were white, and 2.3 percent were of other races. The
race was unknown for 4,132 offenders. (Based on Expanded Homicide Data Table
3). Of the offenders for whom gender was known, 88.2 percent were male."[55]
According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, from 1980 to 2008, 84
percent of white homicide victims were killed by white offenders and 93
percent of black homicide victims were killed by black offenders.[30]

Map of civilian guns per capita by country to the "Small Arms Survey 2007"[56]

The United States has the highest rate of civilian gun ownership per
capita.[56][57][58] According to the CDC, between 1999 and 2014 there have
been 185,718 homicides from use of a firearm and 291,571 suicides using a
firearm.[59] Despite a significant increase in the sales of firearms since
1994, the US has seen a drop in the annual rate of homicides using a firearm
from 7.0 per 100,000 population in 1993 to 3.6 per 100,000.[60] In the ten
years between 2000 and 2009, the ATF reported 37,372,713 clearances for
purchase, however, in the four years between 2010 and 2013, the ATF reported
31,421,528 clearances.[61]

### Property crime[edit]

Burglaries_per_1%2C000_pop.svg.png)

The burglary rates of selected industrialized countries as published by the
U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics

According to a 2004 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, looking at the
period from 1981 to 1999, the United States had a lower surveyed residential
burglary rate in 1998 than Scotland, England, Canada, the Netherlands, and
Australia. The other two countries included in the study, Sweden and
Switzerland, had only slightly lower burglary rates. For the first nine years
of the study period the same surveys of the public showed only Australia with
rates higher than the United States. The authors noted various problems in
doing the comparisons including infrequent data points. (The United States
performed five surveys from 1995 to 1999 when its rate dipped below Canada's,
while Canada ran a single telephone survey during that period for
comparison.)[45]

### Crimes against children[edit]

Further information: Child abuse § U.S. statistics, and Child sexual abuse §
United States and Europe

Violence against children from birth to adolescence is considered a “global
phenomenon that takes many forms (physical, sexual, emotional), and occurs in
many settings, including the home, school, community, care, and justice
systems, and over the Internet."[62]

According to a 2001 report from UNICEF, the United States has the highest rate
of deaths from child abuse and neglect of any industrialized nation, at 2.4
per 100,000 children; France has 1.4, Japan 1, UK 0.9 and Germany 0.8.
According to the US Department of Health, the state of Texas has the highest
death rate, at 4.05 per 100,000 children, New York has 2.46, Oregon 1.49 and
New Hampshire 0.35. [63] A 2018 report from the Congressional Research Service
stated, at the national level, violent crime and homicide rates have increased
each year from 2014 to 2016.[64]

In 2016, data from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS)
revealed that approximately 1,750 children died from either abuse or neglect;
further, this is a continuing trend with an increasing 7.4% of crimes against
children from 2012 to 2016 and these statistics can be compared to a rate of
2.36 children per 100,000 children in the United States general
population.[65] In addition, 44.2% of these 2016 statistics are specific to
physical abuse towards a child. [65]

A 2016 report from the Child Welfare Information Gateway also showed that 78%
of the main perpetrators of violence against children in the United States are
caused by a parent.

#### Human trafficking[edit]

Human trafficking is categorized into the following three groups: (1) sex
trafficking; (2) sex and labor trafficking; and (3) labor trafficking; In
addition, the rate of domestic minor sex trafficking has exponentially
increased over the years. Sex trafficking of children also referred to as
commercial sexual exploitation of children, is categorized by the following
forms: pornography, prostitution, child sex tourism, and child marriage.
Profiles of traffickers and types of trafficking differ in the way victims are
abducted, how they are treated, and the reason for the abduction.

According to a 2017 report from the National Human Trafficking Hotline (NHTH),
out of 10,615 reported survivors of sex trafficking, 2,762 of those survivors
were minors.[66]

The U.S. Department of Justice defines Commercial Sexual Exploitation of
Children (CSEC) as a range of crimes and activities involving the sexual abuse
or exploitation of a child for the financial benefit of any person or in
exchange for anything of value (including monetary and non-monetary benefits)
given or received by any person. These crimes against children, which may
occur at any time or place, rob them of their childhood and are extremely
detrimental to their emotional and psychological development. [67]

##### Types of human sex trafficking[edit]

In Pimp-controlled trafficking, the pimp typically is the only trafficker
involved who has full physical, psychological and emotional control over the
victim _._ In Gang-controlled trafficking, a large group of people has power
over the victim, forcing the victim to take part in illegal or violent tasks
for the purpose of obtaining drugs. Another form is called Familial
trafficking, which differs the most from the two mentioned above because the
victim is typically not abducted. Instead, the victim is forced into being
sexually exploited by family members in exchange for something of monetary
value, whether that's paying back debt, or obtaining drugs or money. This type
of sexual exploitation tends to be the most difficult to detect, yet remains
as the most prevalent form of human sex trafficking within the United
States.[67]

In 2009, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention reported
that the average age when children first fall victim to CSEC is between ages
12 and 14. However, this age has become increasingly younger due to
exploiters' fear of contracting HIV or AIDS from older victims.[67]

In 2018, the Office of Public Affairs within the Department of Justice
released a report from operation “Broken Heart” conducted by Internet Crimes
Against Children (ICAC) task forces, stating that more than 2,300 suspected
online child sex offenders were arrested on the following allegations:[68]

(1) produce, distribute, receive and possess child pornography

(2) engage in online enticement of children for sexual purposes

(3) engage in the sex trafficking of children

(4) travel across state lines or to foreign countries and sexually abuse
children

In addition, a 2011 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics described the
characteristics of suspected human trafficking incidents, identifying roughly
95% of victims as female and over half as 17 years old or younger.[67]

## Geography of crime[edit]

Crime rates vary in the United States depending on the type of community.[69]
Within metropolitan statistical areas, both violent and property crime rates
are higher than the national average; in cities located outside metropolitan
areas, violent crime was lower than the national average, while property crime
was higher.[69] For rural areas, both property and violent crime rates were
lower than the national average.[69]

### Regions[edit]

For regional comparisons, the FBI divides the United States into four regions:
Northeast, Midwest, South, and West.[70] For 2011, the region with the lowest
violent crime was the Midwest, with a rate of 349.9 per 100,000 residents,
while the region with the highest violent crime rate was the South, with a
rate of 428.8 per 100,000.[70] For 2011, the region with the lowest property
crime rate was the Northeast, with a rate of 2,121.8 per 100,000 residents,
while the region with the highest property crime rate was the South, with a
rate of 3,370.8 per 100,000.[70]

### States[edit]

See also: List of U.S. states by homicide rate

Crime rates vary among U.S. states.[71] In 2011, the state with the lowest
violent crime rate was Maine, with a rate of 123.2 per 100,000 residents,
while the state with the highest violent crime rate was Tennessee, with a rate
of 608.2 per 100,000.[71] However, the District of Columbia, the U.S. capital
district, had a violent crime rate of 1,202.1 per 100,000 in 2011.[71] In
2011, the state with the highest property crime rate was South Carolina, with
a rate of 3,904.2 per 100,000, while the state with the lowest property crime
rate was South Dakota, with a rate of 1,817.7 per 100,000.[71] However, Puerto
Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States, had a property crime
rate of 1,395.2 per 100,000 in 2011.[71]

Louisiana's homicide rate of 12.4 per 100,000, in 2017, was the highest among
U.S. states for the 29th straight years according to the 2017 FBI Uniform
Crime Report.[ _citation needed_ ]

### Metropolitan areas[edit]

Further information: United States cities by crime rate

Crime in metropolitan statistical areas tends to be above the national
average; however, wide variance exists among and within metropolitan
areas.[72] Some responding jurisdictions report very low crime rates, while
others have considerably higher rates; these variations are due to many
factors beyond population.[72] FBI crime statistics publications strongly
caution against comparison rankings of cities, counties, metropolitan
statistical areas, and other reporting units without considering factors other
than simply population.[72] For 2011, the metropolitan statistical area with
the highest violent crime rate was the Memphis metropolitan area, with a rate
of 980.4 per 100,000 residents, while the metropolitan statistical area with
the lowest violent crime rate was Logan metropolitan area, with a rate of
47.7.[73][74]

It is quite common for crime in American cities to be highly concentrated in a
few, often economically disadvantaged areas. For example, San Mateo County,
California had a population of approximately 707,000 and 17 homicides in 2001.
Six of these 17 homicides took place in poor East Palo Alto, which had a
population of roughly 30,000. So, while East Palo Alto accounted for a mere
4.2% of the population, about one-third of the homicides took place there.[75]

Crime in ten largest metropolitan areas (2011)[73][74] Metropolitan
statistical area | Violent crime rate | Property crime rate  
\---|---|---  
New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-PA MSA | 406.0 | 1744.1  
Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana, CA MSA | 405.4 | 2232.7  
Chicago-Joliet-Naperville, IL-IN-WI MSA | 357.2 | 2791.5  
Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX MSA | 358.4 | 3498.5  
Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, TX MSA | 550.8 | 3576.9  
Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD MSA | 532.3 | 2747.3  
Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV MSA | 334.6 | 2386.0  
Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, FL MSA | 596.7 | 4193.3  
Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta, GA MSA | 400.9 | 3552.0  
Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, MA-NH MSA | 374.7 | 2109.0

## Number and growth of criminal laws[edit]

There are conflicting opinions on the number of federal crimes,[76][77] but
many have argued that there has been explosive growth and it has become
overwhelming.[78][79][80] In 1982, the U.S. Justice Department could not come
up with a number, but estimated 3,000 crimes in the United States
Code.[76][77][81] In 1998, the American Bar Association (ABA) said that it was
likely much higher than 3,000, but didn't give a specific estimate.[76][77] In
2008, the Heritage Foundation published a report that put the number at a
minimum of 4,450.[77] When staff for a task force of the U.S. House Judiciary
Committee asked the Congressional Research Service (CRS) to update its 2008
calculation of criminal offenses in the United States Code in 2013, the CRS
responded that they lack the manpower and resources to accomplish the
task.[82]
