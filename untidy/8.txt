# Abortions worldwide this year:

retrieving data...

## Sources and methods:

**Definition:** An abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal
or expulsion of an embryo or fetus from the uterus, resulting in or caused by
its death. An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during
pregnancy or can be induced. (definition from _Wikipedia_ ) **

Abortion **as a term most commonly - and in the statistics presented here -
refers to the** induced abortion** of a human pregnancy, while spontaneous
abortions are usually termed _miscarriages_.

**" This year"** refers to the period from Jan 1 at 00:00 up to now.

The data on abortions displayed on the Worldometers' counter is based on the
latest statistics on worldwide abortions published by the World Health
Organization (WHO).

According to WHO, **every year in the world there are an estimated 40-50
million abortions**. This corresponds to approximately **125,000 abortions per
day**.

In the USA, where nearly half of pregnancies are unintended and four in 10 of
these are terminated by abortion [1] , there are over 3,000 abortions per day.
Twenty-two percent of all pregnancies in the USA (excluding miscarriages) end
in abortion. [2]
