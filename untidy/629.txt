There's nothing mysterious about what it will take to limit climate change:
The world needs to transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy.

But the timing of that transition is extremely important.

According to a new study published in the journal Earth System Dynamics, we
could soon cross a point of no return. After that, it'll be almost impossible
to keep Earth's temperature from rising 2 degrees Celsius.

The goal of the Paris agreement was to cut emissions enough to keep the planet
from crossing that limit, since scientists have determined that more than 2
degrees of warming could have catastrophic effects.

The new study calculates that if the world's governments don't initiate a
transition to clean energy sources by 2035 -- meaning that the share of
renewables starts to grow by at least 2% each year -- we'll almost certainly
pass that point of no return.

The exact year could change, according to the researchers' model, if new
technology can remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, or if we see
quicker growth in renewables. But no matter what, the deadline is coming soon.

"In our study we show that there are strict deadlines for taking climate
action," Henk Dijkstra, a professor at Utrecht University in the Netherlands
and one of the study authors, said in a statement. "We conclude that very
little time is left before the Paris targets [to limit global warming] become
infeasible."

Not hitting those targets makes the worst effects of climate change far more
likely. These include rising seas that could swamp coastal cities, searing
heat waves that would cause tens of thousands of deaths, drought, wildfires,
and extreme storms.

## A warming world

By burning fossil fuels, we release carbon dioxide and other gases. Doing so
has already altered Earth's atmosphere in a way that has led it to trap more
heat from the sun. And global temperatures have crept up -- they've already
risen more than 1 degree C higher than in pre-industrial times.

The more greenhouse gases we pump into atmosphere, the more heat we trap. That
part of the equation is certain.

As the study authors wrote, "nowadays, the question is not so much if but by
how much and how quickly the climate will change as a result of human
interference, whether this change will be smooth or bumpy."

Scientists have calculated how much warming will result from the release of
different amounts of carbon dioxide. The new study took those numbers and
combined them with projections of future emissions that will continue to rise
as nations develop and consume more energy.

Based on that model, the new study's authors figured out a potential "point of
no return": the year 2035, unless the share of renewables were to start
growing by 2% a year before then.

That's an ambitious number, considering that from the late 1990s to 2017 (in
about 20 years), the percentage of energy from renewables only grew a total of
3.6%.

## Predicting the point of no return

The authors aren't saying there's one decisive point after which all hope is
lost.

If global energy use were to rise faster, the switch to renewables would have
to happen sooner.

On the other hand, if the share of renewables were to grow by 5% a year
instead of 2%, that could push the date back 10 years. The development of
negative emissions technology that could suck greenhouse gases out of the air
could also push back that no-return date. But even that would only give us six
to 10 extra years -- and the switch to renewables still would be required.

Regardless of these caveats, the study suggests that the clock is ticking, and
it's going to get harder to meet our goals the longer we delay.

## Uncertain consequences

In the study, the authors explain that it gets harder to predict climate
consequences and the world's response to them as the Earth's temperature gets
higher.

That's because research suggests that certain natural systems on the planet
could be activated by warming and consequently trigger further warming. A
recent paper that explained this concept: if those systems are triggered at 2
degrees, it said, that might cause temperatures to spike even higher
regardless of how we control emissions. The study dubbed this scenario
"hothouse Earth."

In that situation, Earth's average temperature could rise 4 or 5 degrees
Celsius above pre-industrial levels, leading to sea levels up to 200 feet
higher than they are now.

Because of that uncertainty, the paper's authors hope that establishing a
timeline for a potential point of no return will spur the world's leaders (and
voters) to act sooner rather than later.

"We hope that 'having a deadline' may stimulate the sense of urgency to act
for politicians and policy makers," Dijkstra said in a statement. "Very little
time is left."
