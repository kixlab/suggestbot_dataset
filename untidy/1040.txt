## Teens are Using Drugs In High School

Your teenager might enter high school as a child, but they will graduate as a
young adult. This four-year period is transformational — full of growth,
hardships and self-discovery. It’s also an experimental time — and for
millions of teens, that means trying drugs and alcohol. Sadly, some teens
doing drugs will suffer serious consequences as a result of substance use.

Why do teenagers use drugs? There are countless reasons. Many are reacting to
peer pressure and believe turning to drugs and alcohol is how to become
popular in high school. Some use drugs to self-medicate from painful feelings.
Some teens even turn to study aid drugs like Adderall or Ritalin, because they
believe these substances will boost their grades. High school is often the
first time that kids encounter illicit substances — and the curiosity can be
too much to resist.

## Statistics of Drug Use in High School

Facts about teenage drug and alcohol abuse reveal that 86% of this age group
know someone who smokes, drinks or does drugs during the school day.

### Alcohol

In the U.S., teens abuse alcohol more than any illicit drug. Not surprisingly,
it causes the most harm — teen alcohol abuse is responsible each year for
nearly 200,000 ER visits and 4,300 deaths among kids under 21.

                
                                      * 68% of 12th graders have tried alcohol
                      * 37.4% of 12th graders drank in the last month
                      * 23.5% of 10th graders drank in the last month
                

Among high schoolers, within the month they were surveyed:

                
                                      * 35% drank some alcohol
                      * 21% binge drank (consuming an excessive amount)
                      * 22% rode in someone’s car who’d been drinking
                      * 10% drove after drinking
                

### Marijuana

In terms of illicit drugs, teens use marijuana the most. More high school
seniors smoke pot than smoke cigarettes at this point, and as of 2015, high
school seniors are about as likely to smoke weed as they are to drink.

![Drug Use in High School](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/wp-

content/uploads/2017/05/smoking-weed-school-grades-facts.jpg)

According to experts, around 13% of people who start smoking pot as teenagers
become dependent on it. Regular marijuana use can cause a drop in IQ of up to
8 points. Considering that nearly 3,300 teens try weed for the first time
every day, it’s an undeniable problem that’s impacting high schoolers
everywhere.

The stats show that marijuana use is rampant:

                
                                      * 35.1% of 12th graders have smoked pot in the past year
                      * 21.3% of 12th graders have smoked pot in the last 30 days
                      * 16.6% of 10th graders have smoked pot in the last 30 days
                      * 6% of 12th graders say they use marijuana every day
                      * 81% of 12th graders say it would be easy to get marijuana
                      * Only 32% of 12th graders feel that regular marijuana use is harmful
                

According to one study, 12th graders who smoke marijuana are 65% more likely
to crash their car. Among 12th graders in the U.S., one out of eight drove
after smoking marijuana at some point in the last two weeks — one in five rode
with a driver who’d been smoking.

### Other Drugs Used by High Schoolers

Nearly a quarter of American high schoolers use at least one type of illicit
drug. According to a high school drug use survey from National Institute of
Drug Abuse, the next most popular drugs in high schools — especially among
12th graders — are:

                
                                      * Amphetamines
                      * Adderall
                      * Opioid painkillers
                      * Synthetic marijuana
                      * Tranquilizers
                      * Cough medicine
                      * Vicodin
                      * Hallucinogens
                      * OxyContin
                      * Sedatives
                      * Ecstasy (MDMA)
                      * LSD
                      * Cocaine
                      * Ritalin
                      * Inhalants
                      * Salvia
                

Approximately 2.5% of seniors are caught up in cocaine use. This may seem
small, but it amounts to more than a million teens doing drugs that could kill
them. High school deaths are reported each year for nearly every drug on that
list. Don’t assume that your kids aren’t using, or that they’re safe from
these dangers. It’s a mistake that far too many parents have made in the past.

## Effects of Drug Use in High School

Consequences of addiction include brain abnormalities, slowed thinking and
impaired learning and memory. It can also deplete the brain of certain
chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, sending high schoolers into a prolonged
depression and leaving them susceptible for more destructive behaviors.

Alcohol abuse in high school impacts the brain just as hard as other drugs.
Memory problems and other life-long brain issues are common in high schoolers
who drink excessively. And kids who start before age 15 are 6 times more
likely to develop alcoholism later in life than individuals who wait until 21.

Substance abuse in high school can also cause stunted growth — in one study,
high school boys addicted to weed were an average of 4.6 inches shorter when
they reached age 20.

### Substance Abuse in Schools

High schoolers can find drugs through a friend, through word-of-mouth and on
the Internet. Most kids needn’t look any further than their school — nearly
44% of high school students know a classmate who sells drugs. When asked which
drugs are sold:

                
                                      * 91% said marijuana
                      * 24% said prescription drugs
                      * 9% said cocaine
                      * 7% said ecstasy
                

## Does Your Teenager Need Addiction Treatment?

If you notice any signs of addiction, now is the time to reach out to a
professional. There is help for teenagers on drugs or alcohol, but the longer
that substance abuse continues, the harder it will be for your child to
recover over the long-term.

![teen boy sitting in park needing drug treatment](/wp-

content/uploads/2017/05/teen-boy-sitting-in-park-needing-drug-treatment.jpg)

We know that it can be difficult to reach out for help — especially because
our society often stigmatizes and shames people who are suffering from
addiction. But your child’s life is far more important than what your
neighbors may think. Besides, real friends will offer love and understanding,
not judgment.

Your professional of choice can help you determine the best course of action,
and whether you should begin looking into substance abuse treatment options.
Depending upon the severity of addiction, they might encourage inpatient or
outpatient drug rehab. At that point, you’d need to look into insurance for
rehab and any possible out-of-pocket costs of drug rehab treatment.

At TheRecoveryVillage.com, we can help you sort through those details —
confidentially. You are not alone — call to speak with one of our addiction
specialists today.

# Medical Marijuana

By Anne Harding

From the WebMD Archives

More states are passing laws that allow people to use medical marijuana. So
what does it treat, and who can and should use it?

Pain is the main reason people ask for a prescription, says Barth Wilsey, MD,
a pain medicine specialist at the University of California Davis Medical
Center. It could be from headaches, a disease like cancer, or a long-term
condition, like glaucoma or nerve pain.

If you live in a state where medical marijuana is legal and your doctor thinks
it would help, you’ll get a “marijuana card.” You will be put on a list that
allows you to buy marijuana from an authorized seller, called a dispensary.

Doctors also may prescribe medical marijuana to treat:

                
                                      * Muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis
                      * Nausea from cancer chemotherapy
                      * Poor appetite and weight loss caused by chronic illness, such as HIV, or nerve pain
                      * Seizure disorders
                      * Crohn's disease
                

The FDA has also approved THC, a key ingredient in marijuana, to treat nausea
and improve appetite. It's available by prescription Marinol (dronabinol) and
Cesamet (nabilone).

## How Does It Work?

Your body already makes marijuana-like chemicals that affect pain,
inflammation, and many other processes. Marijuana can sometimes help those
natural chemicals work better, says Laura Borgelt, PharmD, of the University
of Colorado.

## How Is It Used?

Medical marijuana may be:

                
                                      * Smoked
                      * Vaporized (heated until active ingredients are released, but no smoke is formed)
                      * Eaten (usually in the form of cookies or candy)
                      * Taken as a liquid extract
                

## Side Effects

Side effects of marijuana that usually don’t last long can include:

                
                                      * Dizziness
                      * Drowsiness
                      * Short-term memory loss
                      * Euphoria
                

More serious side effects include severe anxiety and psychosis.

## Risks and Limits

Medical marijuana is not monitored like FDA-approved medicines. When using it,
you don’t know its potential to cause cancer, its purity, potency, or side
effects.

Only people who have a card from a doctor should use medical marijuana.
Doctors will not prescribe medical marijuana to anyone under 18. Others who
should not use it:

                
                                      * People with heart disease
                      * Pregnant women
                      * People with a history of psychosis

# How are authorities destroying seized drugs?

Cardboard boxes and paper envelopes packed with marijuana, cocaine and other
drugs line warehouse-style shelves at the State Highway Patrol's Ohio crime
laboratory, where seizures large and small are stored for safekeeping for
sometimes years until they're no longer needed as evidence.

Then comes a tricky task: How do you destroy it all?

Most often by incineration, but where and how varies, according to police
spokesmen and officers who oversee evidence. Arranging evidence burns can be
tricky because rules are different everywhere, allowing more leeway in some
places than others.

Police have used crematories, foundries, hospital incinerators or specialized
businesses -- and even torched drugs in 55-gallon drums.

Troopers in Ohio used to destroy thousands of pounds of seized drugs -- for
free -- at factories where they could be vaporized in molten steel. But the
companies worried about it potentially affecting the quality of their product
and producing emissions: the kind that create environmental concerns and the
kind that could skew employee drug tests, said Capt. David Dicken, a director
at the crime lab.

"If we're throwing 940 pounds of marijuana into the vat, you know, it flares
up," he said.

To maintain a dedicated drug destroyer, the agency switched last year to a
paid contract with a federally permitted company that handles hazardous
materials.

Federal standards regulate waste incinerators that burn pharmaceuticals, but
those used only for contraband are exempt from those rules, said Dina Pierce,
a spokeswoman for the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.

Various local environmental and safety rules can apply, creating a complicated
regulatory picture for evidence-management officers sorting out what
destruction methods are allowed, said Joseph Latta, an instructor and
executive director at the Burbank, California-based nonprofit International
Association for Property and Evidence Inc.

"During the class, we say, 'Here are the ways that we've heard of. Here are
the legal ways. Here are some maybe unorthodox ways that we've had to do,"
Latta said.

U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, which seizes millions of pounds of illegal
narcotics, pays contractors to destroy the drugs or turns them over to other
agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Agency, said Jaime Ruiz, a CBP
spokesman.

DEA destroys marijuana at EPA-approved incinerators because those seizures are
generally bulkier, and it burns other contraband drugs at its labs, said
Special Agent Rich Isaacson, spokesman for the agency's Detroit division.

In California, where environmental regulations tend to be stricter, the legal
option is usually limited to EPA-approved energy-plant incinerators that
operate under emissions and security standards, Latta said. But reaching those
sites could be impractical for smaller, more rural law enforcement agencies
that take in lesser amounts of drugs, he said, acknowledging some "have
probably taken shortcuts."

It can be a dilemma for officers who must either arrange for destruction or
allow drug evidence to accumulate, which risks making the storage area a
potential theft target, Latta said.

Other jurisdictions have more choices: State police in the Detroit area use a
metal forging plant's high-temperature furnace, but smaller posts use burn
barrels. Indiana State Police have similar options. Pennsylvania State Police
handle drug destruction internally, such as with a small incinerator. New York
State Police use an outside contractor they won't disclose.

In West Virginia, some authorities may use fire pits, state police Capt. Joe
White said.

Drug destruction arrangements with steel facilities still work for some
agencies, including Columbus, Ohio, police and the FBI's Cleveland division.
Cincinnati police are using that option for the first time this year because
the university facility they used in the past stopped providing the service,
department spokeswoman Sgt. Julian Johnson said.

Especially when drug-destruction work is pro bono, police tend to be tight-
lipped about details to protect security, the businesses involved and
sometimes the arrangements themselves.

"The word gets out there that this facility does it, then 50 other agencies
want to go there ... and that gets to be too much for that place to handle,
and then you lose that place. And then you've got to go find another one,"
said Sgt. Jeff Yaney, who oversees evidence for Dayton, Ohio, police.

Yaney wouldn't divulge where the department destroys drugs. It used to take
advantage of the incinerator that burned classified materials at nearby
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, but the base replaced it with a shredder
rather than paying for changes to meet environmental rules a few years ago.

Representatives for two federally permitted hazardous waste incinerators in
Ohio, Ross Environmental Services Inc. near Elyria and the patrol's vendor,
Heritage Environmental Services in East Liverpool, said they provide a more
controlled, secure destruction process with environmental protections and
benefits not necessarily found at other types of facilities.

For that, though, agencies generally must pay. Heritage has destroyed about
10,000 pounds of drugs and paraphernalia since July for the patrol, at a cost
of roughly $22,000, said Lt. Craig Cvetan, a patrol spokesman. The funding
came from seized drug money, which is also used for drug enforcement and drug-
abuse prevention programs.
