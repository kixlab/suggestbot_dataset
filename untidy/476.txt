**Quantum entanglement** is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or
groups of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in
ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described
independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are
separated by a large distance.

Measurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and
polarization, performed on entangled particles are found to be correlated. For
example, if a pair of particles is generated in such a way that their total
spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on
a certain axis, the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis,
will be found to be counterclockwise, as is to be expected due to their
entanglement. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical
effects: any measurement of a property of a particle performs an irreversible
collapse on that particle and will change the original quantum state. In the
case of entangled particles, such a measurement will be on the entangled
system as a whole.

Such phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris
Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen,[1] and several papers by Erwin Schrödinger shortly
thereafter,[2][3] describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox.
Einstein and others considered such behavior to be impossible, as it violated
the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as "spooky
action at a distance")[4] and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum
mechanics must therefore be incomplete.

Later, however, the counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics were
verified experimentally[5] in tests where the polarization or spin of
entangled particles were measured at separate locations, statistically
violating Bell's inequality. In earlier tests it couldn't be absolutely ruled
out that the test result at one point could have been subtly transmitted to
the remote point, affecting the outcome at the second location.[6] However so-
called "loophole-free" Bell tests have been performed in which the locations
were separated such that communications at the speed of light would have taken
longer—in one case 10,000 times longer—than the interval between the
measurements.[7][8]

According to _some_ interpretations of quantum mechanics, the effect of one
measurement occurs instantly. Other interpretations which don't recognize
wavefunction collapse dispute that there is any "effect" at all. However, all
interpretations agree that entanglement produces _correlation_ between the
measurements and that the mutual information between the entangled particles
can be exploited, but that any _transmission_ of information at faster-than-
light speeds is impossible.[9][10]

Quantum entanglement has been demonstrated experimentally with
photons,[11][12][13][14] neutrinos,[15] electrons,[16][17] molecules as large
as buckyballs,[18][19] and even small diamonds.[20][21] The utilization of
entanglement in communication and computation is a very active area of
research.

paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen.[1] In this study, the three
formulated the EPR paradox, a thought experiment that attempted to show that
quantum mechanical theory was incomplete. They wrote: "We are thus forced to
conclude that the quantum-mechanical description of physical reality given by
wave functions is not complete."[1]

However, the three scientists did not coin the word _entanglement_ , nor did
they generalize the special properties of the state they considered. Following
the EPR paper, Erwin Schrödinger wrote a letter to Einstein in German in which
he used the word _Verschränkung_ (translated by himself as _entanglement_ )
"to describe the correlations between two particles that interact and then
separate, as in the EPR experiment."[22]

Schrödinger shortly thereafter published a seminal paper defining and
discussing the notion of "entanglement." In the paper he recognized the
importance of the concept, and stated:[2] "I would not call [entanglement]
_one_ but rather _the_ characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that
enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought."

Like Einstein, Schrödinger was dissatisfied with the concept of entanglement,
because it seemed to violate the speed limit on the transmission of
information implicit in the theory of relativity.[23] Einstein later famously
derided entanglement as " _spukhafte Fernwirkung_ "[24] or "spooky action at a
distance."

The EPR paper generated significant interest among physicists which inspired
much discussion about the foundations of quantum mechanics (perhaps most
famously Bohm's interpretation of quantum mechanics), but produced relatively
little other published work. So, despite the interest, the weak point in EPR's
argument was not discovered until 1964, when John Stewart Bell proved that one
of their key assumptions, the principle of locality, as applied to the kind of
hidden variables interpretation hoped for by EPR, was mathematically
inconsistent with the predictions of quantum theory.

Specifically, Bell demonstrated an upper limit, seen in Bell's inequality,
regarding the strength of correlations that can be produced in any theory
obeying local realism, and he showed that quantum theory predicts violations
of this limit for certain entangled systems.[25] His inequality is
experimentally testable, and there have been numerous relevant experiments,
starting with the pioneering work of Stuart Freedman and John Clauser in
1972[26] and Alain Aspect's experiments in 1982,[27] all of which have shown
agreement with quantum mechanics rather than the principle of local realism.

Until recently each had left open at least one loophole by which it was
possible to question the validity of the results. However, in 2015 an
experiment was performed that simultaneously closed both the detection and
locality loopholes, and was heralded as "loophole-free"; this experiment ruled
out a large class of local realism theories with certainty.[28] Alain Aspect
notes that the setting-independence loophole – which he refers to as "far-
fetched", yet, a "residual loophole" that "cannot be ignored" – has yet to be
closed, and the free-will / _superdeterminism_ loophole is unclosable; saying
"no experiment, as ideal as it is, can be said to be totally loophole-
free."[29]

A minority opinion holds that although quantum mechanics is correct, there is
no superluminal instantaneous action-at-a-distance between entangled particles
once the particles are separated.[30][31][32][33][34]

Bell's work raised the possibility of using these super-strong correlations as
a resource for communication. It led to the discovery of quantum key
distribution protocols, most famously BB84 by Charles H. Bennett and Gilles
Brassard[35] and E91 by Artur Ekert.[36] Although BB84 does not use
entanglement, Ekert's protocol uses the violation of a Bell's inequality as a
proof of security.

In October 2018, physicists reported that quantum behavior can be explained
with classical physics for a single particle, but not for multiple particles
as in quantum entanglement and related nonlocality phenomena.[37][38]

## Concept[edit]

### Meaning of entanglement[edit]

An entangled system is defined to be one whose quantum state cannot be
factored as a product of states of its local constituents; that is to say,
they are not individual particles but are an inseparable whole. In
entanglement, one constituent cannot be fully described without considering
the other(s). Note that the state of a composite system is always expressible
as a sum, or superposition, of products of states of local constituents; it is
entangled if this sum necessarily has more than one term.

Quantum systems can become entangled through various types of interactions.
For some ways in which entanglement may be achieved for experimental purposes,
see the section below on methods. Entanglement is broken when the entangled
particles decohere through interaction with the environment; for example, when
a measurement is made.[39]

As an example of entanglement: a subatomic particle decays into an entangled
pair of other particles. The decay events obey the various conservation laws,
and as a result, the measurement outcomes of one daughter particle must be
highly correlated with the measurement outcomes of the other daughter particle
(so that the total momenta, angular momenta, energy, and so forth remains
roughly the same before and after this process). For instance, a spin-zero
particle could decay into a pair of spin-½ particles. Since the total spin
before and after this decay must be zero (conservation of angular momentum),
whenever the first particle is measured to be spin up on some axis, the other,
when measured on the same axis, is always found to be spin down. (This is
called the spin anti-correlated case; and if the prior probabilities for
measuring each spin are equal, the pair is said to be in the singlet state.)

The special property of entanglement can be better observed if we separate the
said two particles. Let's put one of them in the White House in Washington and
the other in Buckingham Palace (think about this as a thought experiment, not
an actual one). Now, if we measure a particular characteristic of one of these
particles (say, for example, spin), get a result, and then measure the other
particle using the same criterion (spin along the same axis), we find that the
result of the measurement of the second particle will match (in a
complementary sense) the result of the measurement of the first particle, in
that they will be opposite in their values.

The above result may or may not be perceived as surprising. A classical system
would display the same property, and a hidden variable theory (see below)
would certainly be required to do so, based on conservation of angular
momentum in classical and quantum mechanics alike. The difference is that a
classical system has definite values for all the observables all along, while
the quantum system does not. In a sense to be discussed below, the quantum
system considered here seems to acquire a probability distribution for the
outcome of a measurement of the spin along any axis of the other particle upon
measurement of the first particle. This probability distribution is in general
different from what it would be without measurement of the first particle.
This may certainly be perceived as surprising in the case of spatially
separated entangled particles.

### Paradox[edit]

The paradox is that a measurement made on either of the particles apparently
collapses the state of the entire entangled system—and does so
instantaneously, before any information about the measurement result could
have been communicated to the other particle (assuming that information cannot
travel faster than light) and hence assured the "proper" outcome of the
measurement of the other part of the entangled pair. In the Copenhagen
interpretation, the result of a spin measurement on one of the particles is a
collapse into a state in which each particle has a definite spin (either up or
down) along the axis of measurement. The outcome is taken to be random, with
each possibility having a probability of 50%. However, if both spins are
measured along the same axis, they are found to be anti-correlated. This means
that the random outcome of the measurement made on one particle seems to have
been transmitted to the other, so that it can make the "right choice" when it
too is measured.[40]

The distance and timing of the measurements can be chosen so as to make the
interval between the two measurements spacelike, hence, any causal effect
connecting the events would have to travel faster than light. According to the
principles of special relativity, it is not possible for any information to
travel between two such measuring events. It is not even possible to say which
of the measurements came first. For two spacelike separated events _x_ 1 and
_x_ 2 there are inertial frames in which _x_ 1 is first and others in which
_x_ 2 is first. Therefore, the correlation between the two measurements cannot
be explained as one measurement determining the other: different observers
would disagree about the role of cause and effect.

(In fact similar paradoxes can arise even without entanglement: the position
of a single particle is spread out over space, and two widely separated
detectors attempting to detect the particle in two different places must
instantaneously attain appropriate correlation, so that they do not both
detect the particle.)

### Hidden variables theory[edit]

A possible resolution to the paradox is to assume that quantum theory is
incomplete, and the result of measurements depends on predetermined "hidden
variables".[41] The state of the particles being measured contains some hidden
variables, whose values effectively determine, right from the moment of
separation, what the outcomes of the spin measurements are going to be. This
would mean that each particle carries all the required information with it,
and nothing needs to be transmitted from one particle to the other at the time
of measurement. Einstein and others (see the previous section) originally
believed this was the only way out of the paradox, and the accepted quantum
mechanical description (with a random measurement outcome) must be incomplete.

### Violations of Bell's inequality[edit]

The hidden variables theory fails, however, when we consider measurements of
the spin of entangled particles along different axes (for example, along any
of three axes that make angles of 120 degrees). If a large number of pairs of
such measurements are made (on a large number of pairs of entangled
particles), then statistically, if the local realist or hidden variables view
were correct, the results would always satisfy Bell's inequality. A number of
experiments have shown in practice that Bell's inequality is not satisfied.
However, prior to 2015, all of these had loophole problems that were
considered the most important by the community of physicists.[42][43] When
measurements of the entangled particles are made in moving relativistic
reference frames, in which each measurement (in its own relativistic time
frame) occurs before the other, the measurement results remain
correlated.[44][45]

The fundamental issue about measuring spin along different axes is that these
measurements cannot have definite values at the same time―they are
incompatible in the sense that these measurements' maximum simultaneous
precision is constrained by the uncertainty principle. This is contrary to
what is found in classical physics, where any number of properties can be
measured simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy. It has been proven
mathematically that compatible measurements cannot show Bell-inequality-
violating correlations,[46] and thus entanglement is a fundamentally non-
classical phenomenon.

### Other types of experiments[edit]

In experiments in 2012 and 2013, polarization correlation was created between
photons that never coexisted in time.[47][48] The authors claimed that this
result was achieved by entanglement swapping between two pairs of entangled
photons after measuring the polarization of one photon of the early pair, and
that it proves that quantum non-locality applies not only to space but also to
time.

In three independent experiments in 2013 it was shown that classically-
communicated separable quantum states can be used to carry entangled
states.[49] The first loophole-free Bell test was held in TU Delft in 2015
confirming the violation of Bell inequality.[50]

In August 2014, Brazilian researcher Gabriela Barreto Lemos and team were able
to "take pictures" of objects using photons that had not interacted with the
subjects, but were entangled with photons that did interact with such objects.
Lemos, from the University of Vienna, is confident that this new quantum
imaging technique could find application where low light imaging is
imperative, in fields like biological or medical imaging.[51]

In 2015, Markus Greiner's group at Harvard performed a direct measurement of
Renyi entanglement in a system of ultracold bosonic atoms.

From 2016 various companies like IBM, Microsoft etc. have successfully created
quantum computers and allowed developers and tech enthusiasts to openly
experiment with concepts of quantum mechanics including quantum
entanglement.[52]

### Mystery of time[edit]

There have been suggestions to look at the concept of time as an emergent
phenomenon that is a side effect of quantum entanglement.[53][54] In other
words, time is an entanglement phenomenon, which places all equal clock
readings (of correctly prepared clocks, or of any objects usable as clocks)
into the same history. This was first fully theorized by Don Page and William
Wootters in 1983.[55] The Wheeler–DeWitt equation that combines general
relativity and quantum mechanics – by leaving out time altogether – was
introduced in the 1960s and it was taken up again in 1983, when Page and
Wootters made a solution based on quantum entanglement. Page and Wootters
argued that entanglement can be used to measure time.[56]

In 2013, at the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM) in Turin,
Italy, researchers performed the first experimental test of Page and Wootters'
ideas. Their result has been interpreted to confirm that time is an emergent
phenomenon for internal observers but absent for external observers of the
universe just as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation predicts.[56]

### Source for the arrow of time[edit]

Physicist Seth Lloyd says that quantum uncertainty gives rise to entanglement,
the putative source of the arrow of time. According to Lloyd; "The arrow of
time is an arrow of increasing correlations."[57] The approach to entanglement
would be from the perspective of the causal arrow of time, with the assumption
that the cause of the measurement of one particle determines the effect of the
result of the other particle's measurement.

### Emergent gravity[edit]

Based on AdS/CFT correspondence, Mark Van Raamsdonk suggested that spacetime
arises as an emergent phenomenon of the quantum degrees of freedom that are
entangled and live in the boundary of the space-time.[58] Induced gravity can
emerge from the entanglement first law.[59][60]

## Non-locality and entanglement[edit]

In the media and popular science, quantum non-locality is often portrayed as
being equivalent to entanglement. While this is true for pure bipartite
quantum states, in general entanglement is only necessary for non-local
correlations, but there exist mixed entangled states that do not produce such
correlations.[61] A well-known example are the Werner states that are
entangled for certain values of p s y m {\displaystyle p_{sym}}
![p_{sym}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e67367fbdb2063b5b470bd7aeb040b48644702ce),
but can always be described using local hidden variables.[62] Moreover, it was
shown that, for arbitrary numbers of parties, there exist states that are
genuinely entangled but admit a local model.[63] The mentioned proofs about
the existence of local models assume that there is only one copy of the
quantum state available at a time. If the parties are allowed to perform local
measurements on many copies of such states, then many apparently local states
(e.g., the qubit Werner states) can no longer be described by a local model.
This is, in particular, true for all distillable states. However, it remains
an open question whether all entangled states become non-local given
sufficiently many copies.[64]

In short, entanglement of a state shared by two parties is necessary but not
sufficient for that state to be non-local. It is important to recognize that
entanglement is more commonly viewed as an algebraic concept, noted for being
a prerequisite to non-locality as well as to quantum teleportation and to
superdense coding, whereas non-locality is defined according to experimental
statistics and is much more involved with the foundations and interpretations
of quantum mechanics.[65]

## Quantum mechanical framework[edit]

The following subsections are for those with a good working knowledge of the
formal, mathematical description of quantum mechanics, including familiarity
with the formalism and theoretical framework developed in the articles:
bra–ket notation and mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics.

### Pure states[edit]

Consider two noninteracting systems A and B, with respective Hilbert spaces HA
and HB. The Hilbert space of the composite system is the tensor product

                    
                                         H A ⊗ H B . {\displaystyle H_{A}\otimes H_{B}.} ![ H_A \\otimes H_B.](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/19fca01f34c847473055f02b00ae2c3e51409901)

the state of the composite system is

                    
                                         | ψ ⟩ A ⊗ | ϕ ⟩ B . {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle _{A}\otimes |\phi \rangle _{B}.} ![|\\psi\\rangle_A \\otimes |\\phi\\rangle_B.](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c828da659b247951f5792107fc723ebe7c5577e9)
                    

States of the composite system that can be represented in this form are called
separable states, or product states.

Not all states are separable states (and thus product states). Fix a basis { |

for HB. The most general state in _H A_ ⊗ _H B_ is of the form

                    
                                         | ψ ⟩ A B = ∑ i , j c i j | i ⟩ A ⊗ | j ⟩ B {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle _{AB}=\sum _{i,j}c_{ij}|i\rangle _{A}\otimes |j\rangle _{B}} ![|\\psi\\rangle_{AB} = \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} |i\\rangle_A \\otimes |j\\rangle_B](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d211d5745f4b52151d8489776dfbdf1fee13dc1f).

If a state is inseparable, it is called an 'entangled state'.

For example, given two basis vectors { | 0 ⟩ A , | 1 ⟩ A } {\displaystyle
\scriptstyle {|0\rangle _{A},|1\rangle_ {A}}} ![\\scriptstyle

of HB, the following is an entangled state:

                    
                                         1 2 ( | 0 ⟩ A ⊗ | 1 ⟩ B − | 1 ⟩ A ⊗ | 0 ⟩ B ) . {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}\left(|0\rangle _{A}\otimes |1\rangle _{B}-|1\rangle _{A}\otimes |0\rangle _{B}\right).} ![\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left \( |0\\rangle_A \\otimes |1\\rangle_B - |1\\rangle_A \\otimes |0\\rangle_B \\right \).](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4053aa0fcea6250c60262618348a170fc18ac03b)
                    

If the composite system is in this state, it is impossible to attribute to
either system A or system B a definite pure state. Another way to say this is
that while the von Neumann entropy of the whole state is zero (as it is for
any pure state), the entropy of the subsystems is greater than zero. In this
sense, the systems are "entangled". This has specific empirical ramifications
for interferometry.[66] It is worthwhile to note that the above example is one
of four Bell states, which are (maximally) entangled pure states (pure states
of the _H A_ ⊗ _H B_ space, but which cannot be separated into pure states of
each HA and HB).

Now suppose Alice is an observer for system A, and Bob is an observer for
system B. If in the entangled state given above Alice makes a measurement in
the { | 0 ⟩ , | 1 ⟩ } {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {|0\rangle ,|1\rangle }}
![\\scriptstyle \\{|0\\rangle,

|1\\rangle\\}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/daadd2159fb83a19e0f538ab1bcdd999753ffb04)
eigenbasis of A, there are two possible outcomes, occurring with equal
probability:[67]

                    
                                                1. Alice measures 0, and the state of the system collapses to  | 0 ⟩ A | 1 ⟩ B {\displaystyle \scriptstyle |0\rangle _{A}|1\rangle _{B}} ![\\scriptstyle |0\\rangle_A |1\\rangle_B](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2cc5ace129e7af51062d3f2e8a4d10bbd424fd41).
                            2. Alice measures 1, and the state of the system collapses to  | 1 ⟩ A | 0 ⟩ B {\displaystyle \scriptstyle |1\rangle _{A}|0\rangle _{B}} ![\\scriptstyle |1\\rangle_A |0\\rangle_B](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/76b669b971b79d549e2d788d168232699ec5599b).
                    

If the former occurs, then any subsequent measurement performed by Bob, in the
same basis, will always return 1. If the latter occurs, (Alice measures 1)
then Bob's measurement will return 0 with certainty. Thus, system B has been
altered by Alice performing a local measurement on system A. This remains true
even if the systems A and B are spatially separated. This is the foundation of
the EPR paradox.

The outcome of Alice's measurement is random. Alice cannot decide which state
to collapse the composite system into, and therefore cannot transmit
information to Bob by acting on her system. Causality is thus preserved, in
this particular scheme. For the general argument, see no-communication
theorem.

### Ensembles[edit]

As mentioned above, a state of a quantum system is given by a unit vector in a
Hilbert space. More generally, if one has less information about the system,
then one calls it an 'ensemble' and describes it by a density matrix, which is
a positive-semidefinite matrix, or a trace class when the state space is
infinite-dimensional, and has trace 1. Again, by the spectral theorem, such a
matrix takes the general form:

                    
                                         ρ = ∑ i w i | α i ⟩ ⟨ α i | , {\displaystyle \rho =\sum _{i}w_{i}|\alpha _{i}\rangle \langle \alpha _{i}|,} ![\\rho = \\sum_i w_i |\\alpha_i\\rangle \\langle\\alpha_i|,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b4708b78f8713fd851ab3f5d8e97d8f85b873c0)
                    

where the _w_ i are positive-valued probabilities (they sum up to 1), the
vectors αi are unit vectors, and in the infinite-dimensional case, we would
take the closure of such states in the trace norm. We can interpret ρ as
representing an ensemble where wi is the proportion of the ensemble whose
states are | α i ⟩ {\displaystyle |\alpha _{i}\rangle }
![|\\alpha_i\\rangle](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0894b0cce03f69124a81e6f240e13af70918a098).
When a mixed state has rank 1, it therefore describes a 'pure ensemble'. When
there is less than total information about the state of a quantum system we
need density matrices to represent the state.

Experimentally, a mixed ensemble might be realized as follows. Consider a
"black box" apparatus that spits electrons towards an observer. The electrons'
Hilbert spaces are identical. The apparatus might produce electrons that are
all in the same state; in this case, the electrons received by the observer
are then a pure ensemble. However, the apparatus could produce electrons in
different states. For example, it could produce two populations of electrons:
one with state | z + ⟩ {\displaystyle |\mathbf {z} +\rangle }
![|\\mathbf{z}+\\rangle](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/567f15dd6efff02e103e9637ee7cf4954ff92662)
with spins aligned in the positive **z** direction, and the other with state |

![|\\mathbf{y}-\\rangle](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ee2032e156f9a7256cfb8095258bce23a33e0345)
with spins aligned in the negative **y** direction. Generally, this is a mixed
ensemble, as there can be any number of populations, each corresponding to a
different state.

Following the definition above, for a bipartite composite system, mixed states
are just density matrices on _H A_ ⊗ _H B_. That is, it has the general form

                    
                                         ρ = ∑ i w i [ ∑ j c ¯ i j ( | α i j ⟩ ⊗ | β i j ⟩ ) ] ⊗ [ ∑ k c i k ( ⟨ α i k | ⊗ ⟨ β i k | ) ] {\displaystyle \rho =\sum _{i}w_{i}\left[\sum _{j}{\bar {c}}_{ij}(|\alpha _{ij}\rangle \otimes |\beta _{ij}\rangle )\right]\otimes \left[\sum _{k}c_{ik}(\langle \alpha _{ik}|\otimes \langle \beta _{ik}|)\right]} ![\\rho =\\sum _{{i}}w_{i}\\left\[\\sum _{{j}}{\\bar  {c}}_{{ij}}\(|\\alpha _{{ij}}\\rangle \\otimes |\\beta _{{ij}}\\rangle \)\\right\]\\otimes \\left\[\\sum _{k}c_{{ik}}\(\\langle \\alpha _{{ik}}|\\otimes \\langle \\beta _{{ik}}|\)\\right\]](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bf6f2bd84a64fac8cafbb0c06e14180aad4e4401)
                    

where the _w_ i are positively valued probabilities, ∑ j | c i j | 2 = 1
{\displaystyle \sum _{j}|c_ {ij}|^{2}=1} ![\\sum

_{j}|c_{{ij}}|^{2}=1](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc8a439ed3a43d33671d3cb9ffa9a619c5c41627),
and the vectors are unit vectors. This is self-adjoint and positive and has
trace 1.

Extending the definition of separability from the pure case, we say that a
mixed state is separable if it can be written as[68]:131–132

                    
                                         ρ = ∑ i w i ρ i A ⊗ ρ i B , {\displaystyle \rho =\sum _{i}w_{i}\rho _{i}^{A}\otimes \rho _{i}^{B},} ![\\rho =\\sum _{i}w_{i}\\rho _{i}^{A}\\otimes \\rho _{i}^{B},](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6597264612d7732f42fd586b145e28e9b04aa329)
                    

where the wi are positively valued probabilities and the ρ i A {\displaystyle
\rho
_{i}^{A}}![\\rho_i^A](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/60b5bc5b7612e68b45a4ce589c0e4c289df55b34)
's and ρ i B {\displaystyle \rho _{i}^{B}}
![\\rho_i^B](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/475221b5b58c88f20750357c28e1c45b9087f9bf)'s
are themselves mixed states (density operators) on the subsystems A and B
respectively. In other words, a state is separable if it is a probability
distribution over uncorrelated states, or product states. By writing the
density matrices as sums of pure ensembles and expanding, we may assume
without loss of generality that ρ i A {\displaystyle \rho
_{i}^{A}}![\\rho_i^A](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/60b5bc5b7612e68b45a4ce589c0e4c289df55b34)

are themselves pure ensembles. A state is then said to be entangled if it is
not separable.

In general, finding out whether or not a mixed state is entangled is
considered difficult. The general bipartite case has been shown to be NP-
hard.[69] For the 2 × 2 and 2 × 3 cases, a necessary and sufficient criterion
for separability is given by the famous Positive Partial Transpose (PPT)
condition.[70]

### Reduced density matrices[edit]

The idea of a reduced density matrix was introduced by Paul Dirac in 1930.[71]
Consider as above systems A and B each with a Hilbert space HA, HB. Let the
state of the composite system be

                    
                                         | Ψ ⟩ ∈ H A ⊗ H B . {\displaystyle |\Psi \rangle \in H_{A}\otimes H_{B}.} ![ |\\Psi \\rangle \\in H_A \\otimes H_B. ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b222fc006a0cca79472f2fbb1313f03c2b512490)
                    

As indicated above, in general there is no way to associate a pure state to
the component system A. However, it still is possible to associate a density
matrix. Let

                    
                                         ρ T = | Ψ ⟩ ⟨ Ψ | {\displaystyle \rho _{T}=|\Psi \rangle \;\langle \Psi |} ![\\rho_T = |\\Psi\\rangle \\; \\langle\\Psi|](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/354e47cf72ebfb19333d551ac631ca85d9fc2c0b).
                    

which is the projection operator onto this state. The state of A is the
partial trace of ρT over the basis of system B:

                    
                                         ρ A = d e f ∑ j ⟨ j | B ( | Ψ ⟩ ⟨ Ψ | ) | j ⟩ B = Tr B ρ T . {\displaystyle \rho _{A}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\ \sum _{j}\langle j|_{B}\left(|\Psi \rangle \langle \Psi |\right)|j\rangle _{B}={\hbox{Tr}}_{B}\;\rho _{T}.} ![\\rho_A \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\sum_j \\langle j|_B \\left\( |\\Psi\\rangle \\langle\\Psi| \\right\) |j\\rangle_B = \\hbox{Tr}_B \\; \\rho_T.](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/04ee503ffefad5e7df1fdea6c93961f7961efded)
                    

ρA is sometimes called the reduced density matrix of ρ on subsystem A.
Colloquially, we "trace out" system B to obtain the reduced density matrix on
A.

For example, the reduced density matrix of A for the entangled state

                    
                                         1 2 ( | 0 ⟩ A ⊗ | 1 ⟩ B − | 1 ⟩ A ⊗ | 0 ⟩ B ) , {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}\left(|0\rangle _{A}\otimes |1\rangle _{B}-|1\rangle _{A}\otimes |0\rangle _{B}\right),} ![\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left \( |0\\rangle_A \\otimes |1\\rangle_B - |1\\rangle_A \\otimes |0\\rangle_B \\right\),](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a819774559f3e64569ce18b2c7de993d2066d24)
                    

discussed above is

                    
                                         ρ A = 1 2 ( | 0 ⟩ A ⟨ 0 | A + | 1 ⟩ A ⟨ 1 | A ) {\displaystyle \rho _{A}={\tfrac {1}{2}}\left(|0\rangle _{A}\langle 0|_{A}+|1\rangle _{A}\langle 1|_{A}\right)} ![\\rho_A = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\left \( |0\\rangle_A \\langle 0|_A + |1\\rangle_A \\langle 1|_A \\right \)](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3478e10ff986e37438ad7f5545d605937b805854)
                    

This demonstrates that, as expected, the reduced density matrix for an
entangled pure ensemble is a mixed ensemble. Also not surprisingly, the
density matrix of A for the pure product state | ψ ⟩ A ⊗ | ϕ ⟩ B
{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle _{A}\otimes |\phi \rangle_ {B}}
![|\\psi\\rangle_A \\otimes

|\\phi\\rangle_B](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3ff74a24657c12842e203b89a4427f0cfabd067d)
discussed above is

                    
                                         ρ A = | ψ ⟩ A ⟨ ψ | A {\displaystyle \rho _{A}=|\psi \rangle _{A}\langle \psi |_{A}} ![{\\displaystyle \\rho _{A}=|\\psi \\rangle _{A}\\langle \\psi |_{A}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b672eec721c2dde05973d40e3a730ae07568e54).
                    

In general, a bipartite pure state ρ is entangled if and only if its reduced
states are mixed rather than pure.

### Two applications that use them[edit]

Reduced density matrices were explicitly calculated in different spin chains
with unique ground state. An example is the one-dimensional AKLT spin
chain:[72] the ground state can be divided into a block and an environment.
The reduced density matrix of the block is proportional to a projector to a
degenerate ground state of another Hamiltonian.

The reduced density matrix also was evaluated for XY spin chains, where it has
full rank. It was proved that in the thermodynamic limit, the spectrum of the
reduced density matrix of a large block of spins is an exact geometric
sequence[73] in this case.

### Entanglement as a resource[edit]

In quantum information theory, entangled states are considered a 'resource',
i.e., something costly to produce and that allows to implement valuable
transformations. The setting in which this perspective is most evident is that
of "distant labs", i.e., two quantum systems labeled "A" and "B" on each of
which arbitrary quantum operations can be performed, but which do not interact
with each other quantum mechanically. The only interaction allowed is the
exchange of classical information, which combined with the most general local
quantum operations gives rise to the class of operations called LOCC (local
operations and classical communication). These operations do not allow the
production of entangled states between the systems A and B. But if A and B are
provided with a supply of entangled states, then these, together with LOCC
operations can enable a larger class of transformations. For example, an
interaction between a qubit of A and a qubit of B can be realized by first
teleporting A's qubit to B, then letting it interact with B's qubit (which is
now a LOCC operation, since both qubits are in B's lab) and then teleporting
the qubit back to A. Note that two maximally entangled states of two qubits
are used up in this process. Thus entangled states are a resource that enables
the realization of quantum interactions (or of quantum channels) in a setting
where only LOCC are available, but they are consumed in the process. There are
other applications where entanglement can be seen as a resource, e.g., private
communication or distinguishing quantum states.[74]

### Classification of entanglement[edit]

Not all quantum states are equally valuable as a resource. To quantify this
value, different entanglement measures (see below) can be used, that assign a
numerical value to each quantum state. However, it is often interesting to
settle for a coarser way to compare quantum states. This gives rise to
different classification schemes. Most entanglement classes are defined based
on whether states can be converted to other states using LOCC or a subclass of
these operations. The smaller the set of allowed operations, the finer the
classification. Important examples are:

                    
                                                * If two states can be transformed into each other by a local unitary operation, they are said to be in the same _LU class_. This is the finest of the usually considered classes. Two states in the same LU class have the same value for entanglement measures and the same value as a resource in the distant-labs setting. There is an infinite number of different LU classes (even in the simplest case of two qubits in a pure state).[75][76]
                            * If two states can be transformed into each other by local operations including measurements with probability larger than 0, they are said to be in the same 'SLOCC class' ("stochastic LOCC"). Qualitatively, two states  ρ 1 {\displaystyle \rho _{1}} ![\\rho _{1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e0f2d347f2a0ed7f7c9808c427a89813b957017) and  ρ 2 {\displaystyle \rho _{2}} ![\\rho _{2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/793b211571b3ffe34c4639654d567296d29d7f72) in the same SLOCC class are equally powerful (since I can transform one into the other and then do whatever it allows me to do), but since the transformations  ρ 1 -> ρ 2 {\displaystyle \rho _{1}\to \rho _{2}} ![{\\displaystyle \\rho _{1}\\to \\rho _{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/942457dace61f7de964e603f92a3f2f16138d687) and  ρ 2 -> ρ 1 {\displaystyle \rho _{2}\to \rho _{1}} ![{\\displaystyle \\rho _{2}\\to \\rho _{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7190e9057b105b0847bbb547e18f29bb647b6996) may succeed with different probability, they are no longer equally valuable. E.g., for two pure qubits there are only two SLOCC classes: the entangled states (which contains both the (maximally entangled) Bell states and weakly entangled states like  | 00 ⟩ + 0.01 | 11 ⟩ {\displaystyle |00\rangle +0.01|11\rangle } ![{\\displaystyle |00\\rangle +0.01|11\\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/587cf78fb2f0efce5b5bc27af0fa8fe01d95bf25)) and the separable ones (i.e., product states like  | 00 ⟩ {\displaystyle |00\rangle } ![|00\\rangle ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/79016644d7bb5d4282f69bf8af1befa3131445fb)).[77][78]
                            * Instead of considering transformations of single copies of a state (like  ρ 1 -> ρ 2 {\displaystyle \rho _{1}\to \rho _{2}} ![{\\displaystyle \\rho _{1}\\to \\rho _{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/942457dace61f7de964e603f92a3f2f16138d687)) one can define classes based on the possibility of multi-copy transformations. E.g., there are examples when  ρ 1 -> ρ 2 {\displaystyle \rho _{1}\to \rho _{2}} ![{\\displaystyle \\rho _{1}\\to \\rho _{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/942457dace61f7de964e603f92a3f2f16138d687) is impossible by LOCC, but  ρ 1 ⊗ ρ 1 -> ρ 2 {\displaystyle \rho _{1}\otimes \rho _{1}\to \rho _{2}} ![{\\displaystyle \\rho _{1}\\otimes \\rho _{1}\\to \\rho _{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18f007d3601506321810c4cea20dd31586650876) is possible. A very important (and very coarse) classification is based on the property whether it is possible to transform an arbitrarily large number of copies of a state  ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ![\\rho ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f7d439671d1289b6a816e6af7a304be40608d64) into at least one pure entangled state. States that have this property are called distillable. These states are the most useful quantum states since, given enough of them, they can be transformed (with local operations) into any entangled state and hence allow for all possible uses. It came initially as a surprise that not all entangled states are distillable, those that are not are called 'bound entangled'.[79][74]
                    

A different entanglement classification is based on what the quantum
correlations present in a state allow A and B to do: one distinguishes three
subsets of entangled states: (1) the _non-local states_ , which produce
correlations that cannot be explained by a local hidden variable model and
thus violate a Bell inequality, (2) the _steerable states_ that contain
sufficient correlations for A to modify ("steer") by local measurements the
conditional reduced state of B in such a way, that A can prove to B that the
state they possess is indeed entangled, and finally (3) those entangled state
that are neither non-local nor steerable. All three sets are non-empty.[80]

### Entropy[edit]

In this section, the entropy of a mixed state is discussed as well as how it
can be viewed as a measure of quantum entanglement.

#### Definition[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Von_Neumann_entropy_for_bipartite_system_plot.svg/200px-

Von_Neumann_entropy_for_bipartite_system_plot.svg.png)

The plot of von Neumann entropy Vs Eigenvalue for a bipartite 2-level pure
state. When the eigenvalue has value .5, von Neumann entropy is at a maximum,
corresponding to maximum entanglement.

In classical information theory H, the Shannon entropy, is associated to a
probability distribution, p 1 , ⋯ , p n {\displaystyle p_{1},\cdots ,p_{n}}
![p_1, \\cdots,

p_n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3711f3a8dc0f30eca8b99ff7fb660d911007ab7a),
in the following way:[81]

                    
                                         H ( p 1 , ⋯ , p n ) = − ∑ i p i log 2 ⁡ p i . {\displaystyle H(p_{1},\cdots ,p_{n})=-\sum _{i}p_{i}\log _{2}p_{i}.} ![H\(p_1, \\cdots, p_n \) = - \\sum_i p_i \\log_2 p_i.](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/875a53f0d12455b69f2b0ee8230fc98e151bc87a)
                    

Since a mixed state ρ is a probability distribution over an ensemble, this
leads naturally to the definition of the von Neumann entropy:

                    
                                         S ( ρ ) = − Tr ( ρ log 2 ⁡ ρ ) . {\displaystyle S(\rho )=-{\hbox{Tr}}\left(\rho \log _{2}{\rho }\right).} ![S\(\\rho\) = - \\hbox{Tr} \\left\( \\rho \\log_2 {\\rho} \\right\).](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/58c1e4f3606b03e38fd2c986ec9f25f30f917a83)
                    

In general, one uses the Borel functional calculus to calculate a non-
polynomial function such as log2( _ρ_ ). If the nonnegative operator ρ acts on
a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and has eigenvalues λ 1 , ⋯ , λ n
{\displaystyle \lambda _{1},\cdots ,\lambda_ {n}} ![\\lambda_1, \\cdots,

\\lambda_n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5417ed32af96eccaa187bb395916020ef108ba2f),
log2( _ρ_ ) turns out to be nothing more than the operator with the same
eigenvectors, but the eigenvalues log 2 ⁡ ( λ 1 ) , ⋯ , log 2 ⁡ ( λ n )
{\displaystyle \log _{2}(\lambda_ {1}),\cdots ,\log _{2}(\lambda_ {n})}
![\\log _{2}\(\\lambda _{1}\),\\cdots ,\\log _{2}\(\\lambda

_{n}\)](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1576682bf3e6ee7a8fe1c9b2e99703c28f7e7649).
The Shannon entropy is then:

                    
                                         S ( ρ ) = − Tr ( ρ log 2 ⁡ ρ ) = − ∑ i λ i log 2 ⁡ λ i {\displaystyle S(\rho )=-{\hbox{Tr}}\left(\rho \log _{2}{\rho }\right)=-\sum _{i}\lambda _{i}\log _{2}\lambda _{i}} ![S\(\\rho\) = - \\hbox{Tr} \\left\( \\rho \\log_2 {\\rho} \\right\) = - \\sum_i \\lambda_i \\log_2 \\lambda_i](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/928c2d6ade5615fad5fe82e67e17ca9b07640bb4).
                    

Since an event of probability 0 should not contribute to the entropy, and
given that

                    
                                         lim p -> 0 p log ⁡ p = 0 , {\displaystyle \lim _{p\to 0}p\log p=0,} ![ \\lim_{p \\to 0} p \\log p = 0,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e4050c3b4a3183e1f8af387f25474c7e83bd980)
                    

the convention 0 log(0) = 0 is adopted. This extends to the infinite-
dimensional case as well: if ρ has spectral resolution

                    
                                         ρ = ∫ λ d P λ , {\displaystyle \rho =\int \lambda dP_{\lambda },} ![ \\rho = \\int \\lambda d P_{\\lambda},](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fe3ed8c6820ba4611ceaa17f37092fa6b1225f76)
                    

assume the same convention when calculating

                    
                                         ρ log 2 ⁡ ρ = ∫ λ log 2 ⁡ λ d P λ . {\displaystyle \rho \log _{2}\rho =\int \lambda \log _{2}\lambda dP_{\lambda }.} ![ \\rho \\log_2 \\rho = \\int \\lambda \\log_2 \\lambda d P_{\\lambda}.](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d1e2ffda24b73d9825c02dd64c462acebdeb6be9)
                    

As in statistical mechanics, the more uncertainty (number of microstates) the
system should possess, the larger the entropy. For example, the entropy of any
pure state is zero, which is unsurprising since there is no uncertainty about
a system in a pure state. The entropy of any of the two subsystems of the
entangled state discussed above is log(2) (which can be shown to be the
maximum entropy for 2 × 2 mixed states).

#### As a measure of entanglement[edit]

Entropy provides one tool that can be used to quantify entanglement, although
other entanglement measures exist.[82] If the overall system is pure, the
entropy of one subsystem can be used to measure its degree of entanglement
with the other subsystems.

For bipartite pure states, the von Neumann entropy of reduced states is the
unique measure of entanglement in the sense that it is the only function on
the family of states that satisfies certain axioms required of an entanglement
measure.

It is a classical result that the Shannon entropy achieves its maximum at, and
only at, the uniform probability distribution {1/ _n_ ,...,1/ _n_ }.
Therefore, a bipartite pure state _ρ_ ∈ _H_ A ⊗ _H_ B is said to be a
**maximally entangled state** if the reduced state [ _clarification needed_ ]
of ρ is the diagonal matrix

                    
                                         [ 1 n ⋱ 1 n ] . {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}{\frac {1}{n}}&&\\&\ddots &\\&&{\frac {1}{n}}\end{bmatrix}}.} ![\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{n}& & \\\\ & \\ddots & \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{n}\\end{bmatrix}.](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0ac2c4a2dbfa47eec57c86a3f4939f6aaf0adc23)
                    

For mixed states, the reduced von Neumann entropy is not the only reasonable
entanglement measure.

As an aside, the information-theoretic definition is closely related to
entropy in the sense of statistical mechanics[ _citation needed_ ] (comparing
the two definitions, we note that, in the present context, it is customary to
set the Boltzmann constant _k_ = 1 ). For example, by properties of the Borel
functional calculus, we see that for any unitary operator U,

                    
                                         S ( ρ ) = S ( U ρ U ∗ ) . {\displaystyle S(\rho )=S\left(U\rho U^{*}\right).} ![S\(\\rho\) = S \\left \(U \\rho U^* \\right\).](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5d02f56f32da80d33bbfa1145e42f65612c57e7)
                    

Indeed, without this property, the von Neumann entropy would not be well-
defined.

In particular, U could be the time evolution operator of the system, i.e.,

                    
                                         U ( t ) = exp ⁡ ( − i H t ℏ ) , {\displaystyle U(t)=\exp \left({\frac {-iHt}{\hbar }}\right),} ![U\(t\) = \\exp \\left\(\\frac{-i H t }{\\hbar}\\right\),](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/17432addf55e212c0242d9c0ca3cba98e3c95894)
                    

where H is the Hamiltonian of the system. Here the entropy is unchanged.

The reversibility of a process is associated with the resulting entropy
change, i.e., a process is reversible if, and only if, it leaves the entropy
of the system invariant. Therefore, the march of the arrow of time towards
thermodynamic equilibrium is simply the growing spread of quantum
entanglement.[83] This provides a connection between quantum information
theory and thermodynamics.

Rényi entropy also can be used as a measure of entanglement.

### Entanglement measures[edit]

Entanglement measures quantify the amount of entanglement in a (often viewed
as a bipartite) quantum state. As aforementioned, entanglement entropy is the
standard measure of entanglement for pure states (but no longer a measure of
entanglement for mixed states). For mixed states, there are some entanglement
measures in the literature[82] and no single one is standard.

                    
                                                * Entanglement cost
                            * Distillable entanglement
                            * Entanglement of formation
                            * Relative entropy of entanglement
                            * Squashed entanglement
                            * Logarithmic negativity
                    

Most (but not all) of these entanglement measures reduce for pure states to
entanglement entropy, and are difficult (NP-hard) to compute.[84]

### Quantum field theory[edit]

The Reeh-Schlieder theorem of quantum field theory is sometimes seen as an
analogue of quantum entanglement.

## Applications[edit]

Entanglement has many applications in quantum information theory. With the aid
of entanglement, otherwise impossible tasks may be achieved.

Among the best-known applications of entanglement are superdense coding and
quantum teleportation.[85]

Most researchers believe that entanglement is necessary to realize quantum
computing (although this is disputed by some).[86]

Entanglement is used in some protocols of quantum cryptography.[87][88] This
is because the "shared noise" of entanglement makes for an excellent one-time
pad. Moreover, since measurement of either member of an entangled pair
destroys the entanglement they share, entanglement-based quantum cryptography
allows the sender and receiver to more easily detect the presence of an
interceptor.[ _citation needed_ ]

In interferometry, entanglement is necessary for surpassing the standard
quantum limit and achieving the Heisenberg limit.[89]

### Entangled states[edit]

There are several canonical entangled states that appear often in theory and
experiments.

For two qubits, the Bell states are

                    
                                         | Φ ± ⟩ = 1 2 ( | 0 ⟩ A ⊗ | 0 ⟩ B ± | 1 ⟩ A ⊗ | 1 ⟩ B ) {\displaystyle |\Phi ^{\pm }\rangle ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}(|0\rangle _{A}\otimes |0\rangle _{B}\pm |1\rangle _{A}\otimes |1\rangle _{B})} ![|\\Phi^\\pm\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \(|0\\rangle_A \\otimes |0\\rangle_B \\pm |1\\rangle_A \\otimes |1\\rangle_B\)](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c5e3e97f9337b2928160879b1039b554fa4efd2)
                     | Ψ ± ⟩ = 1 2 ( | 0 ⟩ A ⊗ | 1 ⟩ B ± | 1 ⟩ A ⊗ | 0 ⟩ B ) {\displaystyle |\Psi ^{\pm }\rangle ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}(|0\rangle _{A}\otimes |1\rangle _{B}\pm |1\rangle _{A}\otimes |0\rangle _{B})} ![|\\Psi^\\pm\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \(|0\\rangle_A \\otimes |1\\rangle_B \\pm |1\\rangle_A \\otimes |0\\rangle_B\)](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a64205ed9939419e8ffeb71269e8c15a9dab681).
                    

These four pure states are all maximally entangled (according to the entropy
of entanglement) and form an orthonormal basis (linear algebra) of the Hilbert
space of the two qubits. They play a fundamental role in Bell's theorem.

For M>2 qubits, the GHZ state is

                    
                                         | G H Z ⟩ = | 0 ⟩ ⊗ M + | 1 ⟩ ⊗ M 2 , {\displaystyle |\mathrm {GHZ} \rangle ={\frac {|0\rangle ^{\otimes M}+|1\rangle ^{\otimes M}}{\sqrt {2}}},} ![|\\mathrm{GHZ}\\rangle = \\frac{|0\\rangle^{\\otimes M} + |1\\rangle^{\\otimes M}}{\\sqrt{2}},](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e51e220f2b023d20c1e3d4c7461928e4bbafc1bf)
                    

which reduces to the Bell state | Φ + ⟩ {\displaystyle |\Phi ^{+}\rangle }
![|\\Phi^+\\rangle](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4570afa1cbf91ef240b83f9ad1476558042f4361)
for M = 2 {\displaystyle M=2}
![M=2](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2801ac77396e68de0b640087e1531a2329067e9f).
The traditional GHZ state was defined for M = 3 {\displaystyle M=3}
![M=3](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f650bb93b4dc73fb000a07a4c9d7f3e3094e965d).
GHZ states are occasionally extended to qudits, i.e., systems of _d_ rather
than 2 dimensions.

Also for M>2 qubits, there are spin squeezed states.[90] Spin squeezed states
are a class of squeezed coherent states satisfying certain restrictions on the
uncertainty of spin measurements, and are necessarily entangled.[91] Spin
squeezed states are good candidates for enhancing precision measurements using
quantum entanglement.[92]

For two bosonic modes, a NOON state is

                    
                                         | ψ NOON ⟩ = | N ⟩ a | 0 ⟩ b + | 0 ⟩ a | N ⟩ b 2 , {\displaystyle |\psi _{\text{NOON}}\rangle ={\frac {|N\rangle _{a}|0\rangle _{b}+|{0}\rangle _{a}|{N}\rangle _{b}}{\sqrt {2}}},\,} ![|\\psi_\\text{NOON} \\rangle = \\frac{|N \\rangle_a |0\\rangle_b + |{0}\\rangle_a |{N}\\rangle_b}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\, ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3460314458238d5e6daa7680355aa7589436a147)
                    

This is like the Bell state | Ψ + ⟩ {\displaystyle |\Psi ^{+}\rangle }
![|\\Psi ^{+}\\rangle

](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3fb516a603ad0d72c91c8e3e736aaad102d073f2)
except the basis kets 0 and 1 have been replaced with "the _N_ photons are in
one mode" and "the _N_ photons are in the other mode".

Finally, there also exist twin Fock states for bosonic modes, which can be
created by feeding a Fock state into two arms leading to a beam splitter. They
are the sum of multiple of NOON states, and can used to achieve the Heisenberg
limit.[93]

For the appropriately chosen measure of entanglement, Bell, GHZ, and NOON
states are maximally entangled while spin squeezed and twin Fock states are
only partially entangled. The partially entangled states are generally easier
to prepare experimentally.

### Methods of creating entanglement[edit]

Entanglement is usually created by direct interactions between subatomic
particles. These interactions can take numerous forms. One of the most
commonly used methods is spontaneous parametric down-conversion to generate a
pair of photons entangled in polarisation.[74] Other methods include the use
of a fiber coupler to confine and mix photons, photons emitted from decay
cascade of the bi-exciton in a quantum dot,[94] the use of the Hong–Ou–Mandel
effect, etc., In the earliest tests of Bell's theorem, the entangled particles
were generated using atomic cascades.

It is also possible to create entanglement between quantum systems that never
directly interacted, through the use of entanglement swapping. Two
independently-prepared, identical particles may also be entangled if their
wave functions merely spatially overlap, at least partially.[95]

### Testing a system for entanglement[edit]

A density matrix ρ is called separable if it can be written as a convex sum of
product states, namely

ρ = ∑ j p j ρ j ( A ) ⊗ ρ j ( B ) {\displaystyle \displaystyle {\rho =\sum
_{j}p_ {j}\rho _{j}^{(A)}\otimes \rho_ {j}^{(B)}}} ![{\\displaystyle

\\displaystyle {\\rho =\\sum _{j}p_{j}\\rho _{j}^{\(A\)}\\otimes \\rho

_{j}^{\(B\)}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ac36e69425ae67d2a44ee4d6c448770a741fc153)

with 1 ≥ p j ≥ 0 {\displaystyle 1\geq p_{j}\geq 0} ![{\\displaystyle 1\\geq

p_{j}\\geq

0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/568326a3f3818e10ebe9e14c845e6a0bbdc1a3ac)probabilities.
By definition, a state is entangled if it is not separable.

For 2-Qubit and Qubit-Qutrit systems (2 × 2 and 2 × 3 respectively) the simple
Peres–Horodecki criterion provides both a necessary and a sufficient criterion
for separability, and thus -inadvertently- for detecting entanglement.

However, for the general case, the criterion is merely a sufficient one for
separability, as the problem becomes NP-hard when generalized.[96][97] A
numerical approach to the problem is suggested by Jon Magne Leinaas, Jan
Myrheim and Eirik Ovrum in their paper "Geometrical aspects of
entanglement".[98] Leinaas et al. offer a numerical approach, iteratively
refining an estimated separable state towards the target state to be tested,
and checking if the target state can indeed be reached. An implementation of
the algorithm (including a built-in Peres-Horodecki criterion testing) is
"StateSeparator" web-app.

In 2016 China launched the world’s first quantum communications satellite.[99]
The $100m Quantum Experiments at Space Scale (QUESS) mission was launched on
Aug 16, 2016, from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northern China at
01:40 local time.

For the next two years, the craft – nicknamed "Micius" after the ancient
Chinese philosopher – will demonstrate the feasibility of quantum
communication between Earth and space, and test quantum entanglement over
unprecedented distances.

In the June 16, 2017, issue of _Science_ , Yin et al. report setting a new
quantum entanglement distance record of 1,203 km, demonstrating the survival
of a two-photon pair and a violation of a Bell inequality, reaching a CHSH
valuation of 2.37 ± 0.09, under strict Einstein locality conditions, from the
Micius satellite to bases in Lijian, Yunnan and Delingha, Quinhai, increasing
the efficiency of transmission over prior fiberoptic experiments by an order
of magnitude.[100][101]

## Naturally entangled systems[edit]

The electron shell of multi-electron atoms always consists of entangled
electrons. The correct ionization energy can be calculated only by
consideration of electron entanglement.[102]

## Photosynthesis[edit]

It has been suggested that in the process of photosynthesis, entanglement is
involved in the transfer of energy between light-harvesting complexes and
photosynthetic reaction centers where the kinetic energy is harvested in the
form of chemical energy. Without such a process, the efficient conversion of
optical energy into chemical energy cannot be explained. Using femtosecond
spectroscopy, the coherence of entanglement in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson
complex was measured over hundreds of femtoseconds (a relatively long time in
this regard) providing support to this theory.[103][104]

## Living systems[edit]

In October 2018, physicists reported producing quantum entanglement using
living organisms, particularly between living bacteria and quantized
light.[105][106]

To avoid such action at a distance they have to attribute, to the space-time regions in question, real properties in advance of observation, correlated properties, which predetermine the outcomes of these particular observations. Since these real properties, fixed in advance of observation, are not contained in quantum formalism, that formalism for EPR is incomplete. It may be correct, as far as it goes, but the usual quantum formalism cannot be the whole story." And again on p. 144 Bell says: "Einstein had no difficulty accepting that affairs in different places could be correlated. What he could not accept was that an intervention at one place could influence, immediately, affairs at the other." Downloaded 5 July 2011 from Bell, J. S.

                            65. **^** In the literature "non-locality" is sometimes used to characterize concepts that differ from the non-existence of a local hidden variable model, e.g., whether states can be distinguished by local measurements and which can occur also for non-entangled states (see, e.g., Charles H. Bennett, David P. DiVincenzo, Christopher A. Fuchs, Tal Mor, Eric Rains, Peter W. Shor, John A. Smolin, and William K. Wootters (1999). "Quantum nonlocality without entanglement". _Phys. Rev.
