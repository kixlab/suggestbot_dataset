# How reliable are climate models?

## What the science says...

| Select a level...| ![](images/_core/other/level1.gif) **Basic** | |
![](images/_core/other/level2.gif) Intermediate | |  
---|---|---|---|---|--- 

Models successfully reproduce temperatures since 1900 globally, by land, in
the air and the ocean.

## Climate Myth...

Models are unreliable  
"[Models] are full of fudge factors that are fitted to the existing climate,
so the models more or less agree with the observed data. But there is no
reason to believe that the same fudge factors would give the right behaviour
in a world with different chemistry, for example in a world with increased CO2
in the atmosphere." (Freeman Dyson)

Climate models are mathematical representations of the interactions between
the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, ice - and the sun. This is clearly a
very complex task, so models are built to estimate _trends_ rather than
events. For example, a climate model can tell you it will be cold in winter,
but it can 't tell you what the temperature will be on a specific day - that's
weather forecasting. Climate _trends_ are weather, averaged out over time -
usually 30 years. Trends are important because they eliminate - or "smooth
out" - single events that may be extreme, but quite rare.

Climate models have to be tested to find out if they work. We can't wait for
30 years to see if a model is any good or not; models are tested against the
past, against what we know happened. If a model can correctly predict trends
from a starting point somewhere in the past, we could expect it to predict
with reasonable certainty what might happen in the future.

So all models are first tested in a process called _Hindcasting_. The models
used to predict future global warming can accurately map past climate changes.
If they get the past right, there is no reason to think their predictions
would be wrong. Testing models against the existing instrumental record
suggested CO2 must cause global warming, because the models could not simulate
what had already happened _unless_ the extra CO2 was added to the model. All
other known forcings are adequate in explaining temperature variations prior
to the rise in temperature over the last thirty years, while none of them are
capable of explaining the rise in the past thirty years. CO2 does explain that
rise, and explains it completely without any need for additional, as yet
unknown forcings.

Where models have been running for sufficient time, they have also been proved
to make accurate predictions. For example, the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo
allowed modellers to test the accuracy of models by feeding in the data about
the eruption. The models successfully predicted the climatic response after
the eruption. Models also correctly predicted other effects subsequently
confirmed by observation, including greater warming in the Arctic and over
land, greater warming at night, and stratospheric cooling.

The climate models, far from being melodramatic, may be conservative in the
predictions they produce. For example, here's a graph of sea level rise:

![](https://skepticalscience.com/images/SLR_models_obs.gif)

_Observed sea level rise since 1970 from tide gauge data (red) and satellite
measurements (blue) compared to model projections for 1990-2010 from the IPCC
Third Assessment Report (grey band). (Source: The Copenhagen Diagnosis, 2009)  
_

Here, the models have understated the problem. In reality, observed sea level
is tracking at the upper range of the model projections. There are other
examples of models being too conservative, rather than alarmist as some
portray them. All models have limits - uncertainties - for they are modelling
complex systems. However, all models improve over time, and with increasing
sources of real-world information such as satellites, the output of climate
models can be constantly refined to increase their power and usefulness.

**Climate models have already predicted many of the phenomena for which we now
have empirical evidence. Climate models form a reliable guide to potential
climate change.**

Mainstream climate models have also accurately projected global surface
temperature changes. Climate contrarians have not.

models, and by climate contrarians, compared to observations by NASA GISS.

There's one chart often used to argue to the contrary, but it's got some
serious problems, and ignores most of the data.

## Carbon Brief on Models

In January 2018, CarbonBrief published a series about climate models which
includes the following articles:

Q&A: How do climate models work?  
This indepth article explains in detail how scientists use computers to
understand our changing climate.

Timeline: The history of climate modelling  
Scroll through 50 key moments in the development of climate models over the
last almost 100 years.

In-depth: Scientists discuss how to improve climate models  
Carbon Brief asked a range of climate scientists what they think the main
priorities are for improving climate models over the coming decade.

Guest post: Why clouds hold the key to better climate models  
The never-ending and continuous changing nature of clouds has given rise to
beautiful poetry, hours of cloud-spotting fun and decades of challenges to
climate modellers as Prof Ellie Highwood explains in this article.

Explainer: What climate models tell us about future rainfall  
Much of the public discussion around climate change has focused on how much
the Earth will warm over the coming century. But climate change is not limited
just to temperature; how precipitation - both rain and snow - changes will
also have an impact on the global population.

On 21 January 2012, 'the skeptic argument' was revised to correct for some
small formatting errors.

Look at plate 1 in Hansen's 88 paper, the model includes the oceans. Hansen's
Scenario C is the one that most closely matches the "Land – Ocean"
temperature.

John Cook wrote:  
"A way to test the accuracy of models is through hindcasting - see whether

Not true for any model. All that shows is they can fit the model to the
history. That is beside the point as the IPCC does not claim that the models
can predict anything.

John Cook wrote:  
"The key point is that all the models fail to predict recent warming without
taking rising CO2 levels into account."

Given enough "tunable parameters" that should come as no surprise. The
modelers also assume that there is some positive feedback, there is no proof
that this is the case. Here is one for you straight from the IPCC, Chapter 8,
page 596:

"The number of degrees of freedom in the tuneable parameters is less than the
number of degrees of freedom in the observational constraints used in model
evaluation."

IOW, the models are nothing more then sophisticated curve fits.

Calling the models "predictions" does not instill confidence that you have
done your homework.

Kevin E. Trenberth  
http://blogs.nature.com/climatefeedback/2007/06/predictions_of_climate.html  
"In fact there are no predictions by IPCC at all. And there never have been.
The IPCC instead proffers “what if” projections of future climate that
correspond to certain emissions scenarios."

And from the same letter:  
"Even if there were, the projections are based on model results that provide
differences of the future climate relative to that today. None of the models
used by IPCC are initialized to the observed state and none of the climate
states in the models correspond even remotely to the current observed climate.
In particular, the state of the oceans, sea ice, and soil moisture has no
relationship to the observed state at any recent time in any of the IPCC
models."

John Cook wrote:  
"Satellite measurements show that the troposphere is warming"

The models predict that the troposphere should warm faster then the surface,
it isn't.

**Response:** Re tropospheric warming, I recommend reading Satellite show
little to no warming in the troposphere. The argument over "prediction" vs
"projection" is semantics. Kevin Trenberth is merely saying we don't know with
certainty what future emissions will be so we make predictions based on
various emission scenarios. However, lest it be a stumbling block, I'll update
the text. Thanks for the feedback!

                    
                                                2. **Wondering Aloud** at 01:14 AM on 16 November, 2007
                    

Models are the biggest gun in the arsenal for AGW. What people like Dyson are
telling us is that the models use assumptions that are not validated by
observation and that cannot account for many known effects. The models might
be right but they haven't got a good track record except in hind sight. (After
they've been fudged to fit the past) Someday they will probably be good they
are better than 20 years ago.

                    
                                                3. **StanislavLem** at 17:21 PM on 16 November, 2007
                    

I recommend this paper and it references for this section as well

Leaving aside the silly notion that you can 'prove' a model's accuracy by
checking it's fitting to the historical record--I mean honestly, you are aware
that these models are tweaked _until_ they fit the historical record, aren't
you? The past is not the problem.

The Hansen forecast sounded impressive, so I looked over the paper and did
some googling. There is definitely a different spin on the accuracy of the
forecast. Discussed here:

http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=796

which demonstrates that scenario B is nowhere near the perfect fit implied by
your article or Hansen. Hansen could be right, but he doesn't seem to explain
where he is getting his data from. I can only find vague references to
'Station Data' and 'Land-Ocean'. What data is it he is using? How has it been
adjusted? At least the sceptical article above is up front on where the data
is coming from. This doesn't prove that Hansen is wrong. But it doesn't leave
one with a high degree of confidence either.

                    
                                                5. **jimdk** at 14:07 PM on 2 January, 2008
                    

Well, here is NASA telling us there is no meaningful comparison of models to
observed global temp change  
"The analysis by Hansen et al. (2005), as well as other  
recent studies (see, e.g., the reviews by Ramaswamy  
et al. 2001; Kopp et al. 2005b; Lean et al. 2005; Loeb  
and Manalo-Smith 2005; Lohmann and Feichter  
2005; Pilewskie et al. 2005; Bates et al. 2006; Penner  
et al. 2006), indicates that the current uncertainties  
in the TSI and aerosol forcings are so large that they  
preclude meaningful climate model evaluation by  
comparison with observed global temperature change.  
These uncertainties must be reduced significantly for  
uncertainty in climate sensitivity to be adequately con-  
strained (Schwartz 2004). Helping to address this chal-  
lenging objective is the main purpose of the National  
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glory  
mission, a remote sensing Earth-orbiting observatory"

                                                6. **Will Nitschke (www.capitaloffice.com.au)** at 12:13 PM on 9 January, 2008
                    

Here is an interesting quote from IPPC's AR4 found in chapter 1:

"The strong emphasis placed on the realism of the simulated base state
provided a rationale for introducing ‘flux adjustments’ or ‘flux corrections’
(Manabe and Stouffer, 1988; Sausen et al., 1988) in early simulations. These
were essentially empirical corrections that could not be justified on physical
principles, and that consisted of arbitrary additions of surface fluxes of
heat and salinity in order to prevent the drift of the simulated climate away
from a realistic state. The National Center for Atmospheric Research model may
have been the first to realise non-flux-corrected coupled simulations
systematically, and it was able to achieve simulations of climate change into
the 21st century, in spite of a persistent drift that still affected many of
its early simulations. Both the FAR and the SAR pointed out the apparent need
for flux adjustments as a problematic feature of climate modelling (Cubasch et
al., 1990; Gates et al., 1996).

By the time of the TAR, however, the situation had evolved, and about half the
coupled GCMs assessed in the TAR did not employ flux adjustments. That report
noted that ‘some non-flux adjusted models are now able to maintain stable
climatologies of comparable quality to flux-adjusted models’ (McAvaney et al.,
2001). Since that time, evolution away from flux correction (or flux
adjustment) has continued at some modelling centres, although a number of
state-of-the-art models continue to rely on it."

A 'flux adjustment' is where you discover that the model's predictions start
to vary so much from the historical record that you have to go in and change
the values inside the software to re-fit the model to what's actually
happening. Very confidence inspiring. And what does 'a number of' mean? 50%?
20%? 80%? How many of these models are manually fiddled with to get them to
continue to work...?

                    
                                                7. **Will Nitschke (www.capitaloffice.com.au)** at 08:32 AM on 18 January, 2008
                    

Here is another posting assessing Hansen's model work in a not very favourable
way:

Whether these alternate assessments of Hansen's work stand up is a separate
issue. I would point out we should not accept them blindly any more than we
should blindly accept Hansen's paper on how brilliant Hansen's previous work
was, as this naive article does...

"The models might be right but they haven't got a good track record except in
hind sight. (After they've been fudged to fit the past)"

"Leaving aside the silly notion that you can 'prove' a model's accuracy by
checking it's fitting to the historical record--I mean honestly, you are aware
that these models are tweaked _until_ they fit the historical record, aren't
you?"

Nonsense. Are you saying that Hansen, way back in 1988, was able to travel in
a time machine to 2006 and back, so that he could make the adjustments to his
1988 models to make them agree all the way to the present?

The denialists have nothing but nonsense.

And besides, if models can be "fudged" to fit anything -- as our `skeptics'
claim -- why are the _same_`skeptics' saying that they can't get Hansen's
model to fit the data?

Can it be because our `skeptics' are simply full of junk?

No, we are saying that Hanson's model from 1988 does not fit the present, even
his conservative projections are significantly high of actual observation at
this point. (High relative to the ground based measurements and wildly high
compared to satellite and balloon measurements to be more specific)

If a model can't take past conditions and produce results that fit current
reality it would be obviously useless.

However since modelers are not simpletons that isn't the problem that was
being discussed! The problem is just because current models have been changed
so they can somewhat be used to fit past observations that doesn't mean those
changes were the correct changes, therefore it doesn't mean that they are
making correct predictions. The models still contain assumptions for various
parameters that have not or perhaps can not presently be varified.

Freeman Dyson is correct here, Models are improving but they have a long way
to go before they are better than educated guesses.

You should read Dyson's entire statement this is a bit out of context.

Wondering Aloud:

"because current models have been changed"

You're clearly off spouting rubbish you don't know a thing about.

Look at the temperature predictions in Hansen et al. (2006) and Hansen et al.
(1998). They are _exactly_ _the_ _same_. The 1998 model has _not_ been changed
at all, and it still agrees all the way to 2006. All your talk about "fudge
factors" can't explain that.

I thought this comment was interesting and relevant.

It is taken from the US Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works -
http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.SenateReport#report

Physicist Dr. Freeman Dyson, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the Institute
for Advanced Study, in Princeton, is a fellow of the American Physical
Society, a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, and a fellow of the
Royal Society of London. Dyson called himself a "heretic" on global warming.

"Concerning the climate models, I know enough of the details to be sure that
they are unreliable. They are full of fudge factors that are fitted to the
existing climate, so the models more or less agree with the observed data. But
there is no reason to believe that the same fudge factors would give the right
behavior in a world with different chemistry, for example in a world with
increased CO2 in the atmosphere.," Dyson said in an April 10, 2007 interview.
Dyson is also a fellow of the American Physical Society, a member of the US
National Academy of Sciences, and a fellow of the Royal Society of London.

I'll also raise the question whether anyone really believes this extract (from
above) which appears to be a basic premise for the page:

"This betrays a misunderstanding of the difference between weather, which is
chaotic and unpredictable and climate which is weather averaged out over time.
While you can't predict with certainty whether a coin will land heads or
tails, you can predict the statistical results of a large number of coin
tosses. Or expressing that in weather terms, you can't predict the exact route
a storm will take but the average temperature and precipitation will result
the same for the region over a period of time."

It's a false analogy. Random *independent" events provide statistical
certainty over a period of time. The climate does not fit this description.

Can anyone provide some evidence -peer reviewed citations - that long range
climate forecasting is more accurate than weather forecasting? I know the IPCC
claimed it in their report but they didn't backup the claim.

**Response:** That's the problem with using analogies - the comparison always
breaks down at some point when you compare it directly. The main point is the
contrast between short term, random unpredictability and long term,
statistical summations. While weather is chaotic and non-linear, long term
climate trends are discernable and predictable. As is seen in these peer
reviewed studies analysing the success of climate forecasts.

A common comment regarding GCMs is that they do not account for clouds very
well. This is a substantial weakness. There have been assertions that warming
increases atmospheric water vapor which, through a feedback mechanism,
increases warming. Certainly increased atmospheric water vapor would produce
more, lower-level clouds. How do the GCMs account for this? A simple cloudy-
planet point model where standard atmosphere tables are used to get average
cloud temperature vs altitude shows that a change of average cloud altitude of
305 meters would result in an eventual average earth temperature change of
0.75C. Many other factors known to influence cloud formation are not accounted
for in the GCMs.

I am surprised that John did not reply to this, but I assume he does not have
the time to respond to every nonsensical claim that appears on his board.

Frank, if you do not know that GCMs (and many other models) are "tweaked" to
fit past data, then you have no place attacking others. It is common practice,
and there is little that is nefarious about it, though it may appear as such.
You probably know that there are many uncertainties and complexities in the
climate system, and in attempting to model such a system, you must used what
has already been observed to better your understanding and accuracy. If models
were based purely upon theory for such a complex system, they would appear
wildly inaccurate and worthy of no utilization.

I'm repeating here what I've said in another place on your blog:

The IPCC summary of computer simulations you link above only go back to 1850
and blurs out problems with individual models by replacing the spaghetti curve
with a grayed out region. (Errors in the simulations are highly correlated
from year to year, the figure makes it seem they are not, which is false and
misleading.)

Also did you notice the huge 0.3°C anomaly around 1940-1950 that the models,
even with the fuzzing provided by IPCC, are unable to explain?

Where did that warming come from? I would conclude from that, that we aren't
at the place yet, even for a 150-year period with a lot of fudge factors
thrown in, where we can accurately describe past climate, let alone accurately
predict future climate.

Secondly did you notice that there was very little anthropogenic forcing
before 1970, according to the models? Have you ever considered how
disingenuous it is, given this fact, to compare glaciers from e.g. 100 years
ago to current, when the models say that almost all warming prior to 1970 was
natural?

Robert S:

Yes, I do know that model parameters are usually adjusted according to some
past data, _and_ the resulting model has to be validated with data that are
_not_ used to configure the models in the first place. If I didn't make this
clear enough, my apologies.

From my understanding, this approach of tweaking and holdout validation is
what climate scientists have been doing. And it's perfectly good science, of
course.

Poptech  
When I was in college we were taguht Fortan IV, even though it had already
been supplanted by Fortan 77. I did not realize that anyone was still using
it. My own last experience was in SAS and that was in the 90s. Are you saying
that these climate models are being coded in Fortran?

Poptech, nice job of trying to help people understand what computer modeling
is and what it can do.

Folks, if a climate model doesn't predict past data 100% perfectly then it's
useless. You can create an infinite number of different mathematical models
that will predict any data series 100% perfectly. To deserve any respect these
climate models must predict the previous data perfectly as a start, none
should even be thought about unless it does that, and then it has to predict
the future better than a simple polynomial fit that also perfectly predicts
past data.

Frankbi, all the facts in Poptech's post are verifiable. I learned them in
school. His analysis is spot on.

                    
                                                24. **frankbi** at 21:47 PM on 12 May, 2008
                    

"all the facts in Poptech's post are verifiable. I learned them in school."

I don't think that's what "verifiable" means.

As always, the "criticisms" of climate models are devoid of any concrete,
testable facts.

"on the Skeptic article, by the other author on the same issue."

I didn't think Koutsoyiannis was writing up a "skeptic article", but rather an
assessment of climate models.

"'Cohn and Koutsoyiannis, one of them the author of the very paper that I had
criticized, sat down next to me. We nevertheless had a very civilized and
friendly chat, deciding to disagree on the matter of natural trends.

I don't see how this is relevant-- the paper that Rasmus criticized was a
paper titled "Nature's style: Naturally trendy" by Timothy Cohn and  
Harry Lins. The "But Dr. Koutsoyiannis commended us for being respectful in
our reply to his comments" part of it involved comments made by Koutsoyiannis
on a 2006 realclimate thread.

So hank, I am not exactly sure where you are getting at with your comment
here. Just a little background information on Koutsoyiannis?

Just saw this article referenced on another climate blog:

It studies the accuracy of climate models. Basically compares the model's
predictions vs what happened. The conclusion was that climate models don't
predict forward very well. I don't have the background to judge whether this
article is credible but it did go through a peer reveiw process.

'Average Mean Global Temperature Change' had been updated over on

Can I trust the updated charts posted there? They seem to show actual

To put the Global Warming issue in context, consider:  
1. That average global temperature has decreased since 1998. The anomalies from NOAA data are:  
1998 0.5763  
1999 0.3947  
2000 0.3629  
2001 0.4934  
2002 0.5573  
2003 0.5565  
2004 0.5336  
2005 0.6044  
2006 0.5428  
2007 0.5458  
Jan to June 2008 average 0.44  
2. That GCMs (Global Climate Models) do not yet adequately account for the absorbed infrared radiation energy that is transported up by atmospheric convection currents.  
3. That GCMs are not yet capable of dealing objectively with clouds so they are accounted for with subjective parameterization.  
4. That currently used GCMs invoke water vapor positive feedback that climate history shows to be not valid.  
5. That the GCM users/creators won’t divulge to competent evaluators some of the details of their computer programs.  
6. That the only indicators that human activity causes global warming are these GCMs.  
7. That the multi-billion dollar government grants for ‘climate research’ depend on ominous prediction of looming catastrophe.  
8. That over 30,000 qualified scientists and engineers have signed a document stating that human activity has had no significant influence on climate. 31. **Mizimi** at 06:04 AM on 11 August, 2008

            1. probability and possibility are two different things.  
You may show statistically that something is probable and therefore, sooner or
later will happen. This is only true mathematically and not necessarily works
in the real world. Any computer model that includes assumptions, 'tweaked'
data, or excludes any factors relevent to the model will give a rubbish
result.

            2. Remember the Chaos Effect. Small things through iterative action can have BIG consequencies, so the apparently small and irrelevent must be accounted for.  
Worse yet, we don't even know if we know ALL the factors influencing the
climate....so any model will be suspect.

Just read an interesting abstract on the effect of the moon on the monthly
GMT.  
"Over the past fifty years, the Diurnal Temp Range has decreased by about half
a degree.Conventional wisdom blames this on the greenhouse effect. But this
decrease is just a trend observed in data that vary over shorter  
timescales. Cerveny and Balling show that for the period between 1950 and
1995, the DTR fluctuates with the phases of the Moon. It tends to increase
towards Full Moon, and tends to be lowest at New Moon. Simple  
monthly differences in DTR between New Moon and Full Moon may be as much as
0.309 ºC -- in other words, 60% of the entire 50-year decrease. The message
should be clear: all possible sources of variation should be  
investigated before blaming human activity alone for observed changes in
climatic parameters."

There is a correlation between full moon and monthly DTR variations most of
which is ascribed to the changing earth/moon barycentre. This has prompted a
look at the effects of a shifting sun/earth/moon barycentre on earth climate.  
Another piece in the puzzle?

I would imagine that the difference between full and new is reflected sunlight
and whatever radiation it may contain. This would have an effect on GHGs (I am
thinking water vapor and methane which a recent article at LiveScience talks
about.

QM: Yes, just recently, which prompted me to look for further info on how a
shifting barycentre could affect climate.  
One thought which I am currently pursuing is adiabatic cooling of the upper
atmoshere caused by the tidal effect of sun/moon. As the barycentre moves it
causes the shape of the atmospheric envelope to alter, effectively expanding
the volume, which should cause a cooling effect.

Sandy Winder:  
Gustav was weather, not climate. Gustav was the end product of the climate
process.  
Weather can be predicted over VERY short periods with a reasonable level of
accuracy; at present, climate cannot. This is a good chunk of what the
argument is all about. The uncertainty with Gustav was not that it would hit,
but exactly where and at what level ( eventually I think downgraded to Cat2)
so it would have been foolish to ignore it.  
A side benefit of the dispute is that we are learning a lot more about
climate,history,the biosphere etc.

QM:  
The earth-moon barycentre is around 1700km BENEATH our crust..so the tidal

Apparently climatologists do not have much grounding in how feedback works.
Unaware of their ignorance, they invoke net positive feedback in their GCMs.
This mistake causes the GCMs to predict significant ‘enhanced global warming’.
Anyone who has the ability and interest to look at the NOAA data from Vostok
Ice Cores for the last glaciation (and prior glaciations) will discover that,
repeatedly, a temperature increasing trend changed to a decreasing trend with
the carbon dioxide level higher than it had been when the temperature was
increasing. Graphs of NOAA and other credible data, all fully sourced so they
can be verified, can be seen at http://www.middlebury.net/op-ed/pangburn.html.
(The web site is controlled by Middlebury, not me.) Those who understand how
feedback works will know that this temperature trend reversal is not possible
with significant net positive feedback. Thus, as far as global climate is
concerned and contrary to the assumption in the GCMs, significant net positive
feedback does not exist. Other assessments from entirely different
perspectives also determine that there is no significant net positive
feedback. They can be seen at http://www.climate-
skeptic.com/2008/01/index.html and http://www.weatherquestions.com/Roy-
Spencer-on-global-warming.htm

"In addition phytoplankton emit Dimethyl Sulphide (DMS), which reacts with
oxygen in the atmosphere to produce sulphur dioxide. This acidic gas forms
tiny droplets which help to seed clouds over the ocean, and these reflect
sunlight thus cooling the planet. Measurements of methane sulphonic acid (MSA,
which is derived from DMS) in ice core bubbles indicate that there were more
phytoplankton in the polar oceans during the ice ages, as expected from the
theory above. Therefore as the climate gets warmer there will be less seeding
of clouds over the ocean - clearly a positive feedback."

Atmospheric water vapor is also clearly a positive feedback. There are also
negative feedbacks. Dr. Richard Lindzen has identified one, his iris effect.
Response of the climate system depends on the combined effect of all
feedbacks, known or not. When all are combined, the NET feedback can not be
significantly positive. This is mandated by the temperature trend reversals of
the last and previous glaciations.

Dan:  
Depends what you take as significant. The time span is important,as well as
the net feedback quantity.  
A very small change over a very long period ( like glacial periods) can
eventually have a profound effect, This is the basis of Chaos Theory.  
One of our major problems is that we do not have enough hard data to quantify
these matters to sufficient degree to allow a reasonable model to be
constructed.  
We have a lot of information, knowledge and some data, but mostly we have
guesstimates derived by various means ( some quite dubious), and that isn't
good enough for a system of this complexity.

There is only one complete and exact computer of global climate and that is
the planet itself. By definition it complies with all laws of nature including
physics and quantum mechanics. Einstein said “no number of tests can prove I’m
right but only one is needed to prove I’m wrong”. That one test that proves to
be wrong the theory that added atmospheric carbon dioxide causes global
warming was run on the planet computer and the results are archived in the
Vostok ice cores. They show that, repeatedly, a temperature increasing trend
changed to a decreasing trend with the carbon dioxide level higher than it had
been when the temperature was increasing. Those who understand how feedback
works will know that this temperature trend reversal is not possible with
significant net positive feedback. Thus, as far as global climate is concerned
and contrary to the assumption in the GCMs, significant net positive feedback
does not exist.

Re #41 & etc. Dan Pangburn

Dan, you certainly do talk a lot of nonsense, and you seem to have gone to
extraordinary lengths on your webpage to put together a deliciously incorrect
view of the science!

Let's look at just a couple of things:

(1) ["The planet plunged in to the Andean-Saharan ice age 440 million years
ago10 when the carbon dioxide level was over ten times higher than now."]

No.....there certainly does seem to have been significant glaciation dated to
around 445.6 mya - 443.7 mya, but the atmospheric CO2 levels for this period
are simply not known. You seem to have fallen for the trick of some dubious
character who has drawn straight lines across vast ranges (10’s to 100's of
millions of years) of geological time based on some unspecified temperature
estimates (your posts on this thread are displaying that odd habit of
denigrating pukka science by misrepresentation while at the same time
embracing stuff that is very obviously ludicrous rubbish!).

I would expect everyone can understand the problem that if there are one or
two paleo proxies (temp or CO2, for example) known for some periods in the
past, that one can only say that that's what the temperatures/CO2 levels were
AT THOSE PARTICULAR TIMES. One can't draw a line between the points and
consider that the temperature/CO2 levels over vast intervening periods is thus
established. Imagine an equally dumb geologist from the far future dating
atmospheric CO2 level estimates from 430,000 years ago and 1000 years ago.
"Goodness", he might say, extrapolating massively between limited data points
in gay Scotese style, "highish CO2 levels right through this period. And yet
there is evidence for multiple ice cap incursions right down to the South of
England and deep into North America. Clearly there can't be any relationship
between atmospheric CO2 and temperature"

Doh!

You need to go back and look at the relevant science, rather than trawling for
dodgy “information” on websites[***]! The science has been compiled, for
example, in a recent review by Royer:

D.L. Royer (2006) "CO2-forced climate thresholds during the Phanerozoic"
Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 70, 5665-5675.

Or see:

R.E. Carne, J.M. Eiler, J. Veizer et al (2007) "Coupling of surface
temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the Palaeozoic era"
Nature 449, 198-202

Or:

W. M. Kurschner et al (2008) “The impact of Miocene atmospheric carbon dioxide
fluctuations on climate and the evolution of the terrestrial ecosystem” Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105, 499-453.

And so on….

Sadly there isn't a proxy CO2 measure for the late Ordovician glacial period.
So we don't know if there is a mismatch between atmospheric CO2 levels and
evidence for a cold spell then. It's rather clear (see Royer review, for
example, and the masses of cited data therein, or the other articles cited
just above) that where paleoproxies for atmospheric greenhouse gas levels and
cold/warm spells are dated contemporaneously, that there is a rather good
match (high CO2 associated with warm periods/low atmospheric CO2 with cold
periods).

(ii) Surely by now everyone can understand the rather simple contributions to
ice age cycles and the fundamental differences between solar driven effects
(with CO2/water vapour/albedo feedbacks) and greenhouse gas driven effects of
the sort that we are now seeing. I find it hard to believe that you consider
that you’ve found something worth making such a fuss over, as if there’s
something about the lag between temperature and CO2 levels in the Vostock core
that is not obvious, rather well-understood and pretty consistent with what we
know about greenhouse gases and their effects.

Let’s look at what happens during the ice age cycles driven by the small,
painfully slow variations in the Earth’s orbital properties (Milankovitch
cycles). As the pattern of insolation changes through these cycles the Earth
warms (in a glacial to interglacial transition), ice sheets recede, albedo
effects amplify the warming, the warming oceans release CO2 into the
atmosphere resulting in further warming, atmospheric water vapour levels rise,
and so on. Obviously, since the primary inducer of the warming is increased
solar radiation, and the atmospheric CO2 rise is a result largely of the
release of CO2 from the oceans, the temperature rises in advance of the
atmospheric CO2 levels. That’s pretty obvious and uncontroversial (part of the
lag is apparently also due to interhemispherical effects).

Going the other way (your example of events 112,000 years ago), it’s not
surprising that decreased polar insolation resulted in cooling in advance of
the lowering of atmospheric CO2 levels. It takes rather a long time for
atmospheric CO2 to be absorbed from the atmosphere, and there’s nothing
surprising about the fact that as one “lowers the heater” that the Earth cools
while CO2 levels remain relatively high, as CO2 is very slowly reabsorbed by
the oceans and terrestrial environment..

And of course the CO2 level changes are small and the rates of change are tiny
compared to present day, where the warming we are seeing is the result of
enhanced greenhouse effects with a relatively constant solar insolation. So
whereas during the last glacial to interglacial period, for example,
atmospheric CO2 rose by around 80 ppm over 5000 years (1.6 ppm per 100 years
averaged over the transition), now atmospheric CO2 levels are rising at well
over 100 times faster (2-2.5 ppm per year).

Everyone that takes the smallest effort to inform themselves is aware of the
essential differences between ice age transitions (Milankovitch cycles drive
extremely slow variations in atmospheric CO2 with very slow feedbacks) and
present day warming (extremely rapid increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas
concentrations resulting in rapid temperature increases). During ice age
transitions the processes were sufficiently slow that the Earth’s temperature
likely was near-equilibrium with the forcings (varying insolation, greenhouse
gas levels and associated feedbacks). Now atmospheric greenhouse gas levels
are rising far more quickly than the Earth’s temperature is able to keep pace
with (the inertia from the massive ocean) and so we still have rather a lot of
warming “in the pipeline” from current levels of atmospheric CO2, not to
mention the amount of warming yet to be unmasked, as a result of man-made
aerosolic countering of enhanced greenhouse-induced warming:

e.g. V. Ramanathan and Y. Feng (2008) “On avoiding dangerous anthropogenic
interference with the climate system: Formidable challenges ahead.” Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA in press.

http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/09/16/0803838105.abstract

(iii) Your data on temperature/CO2 relationships are laughable. Just to choose
one jaw-dropping example, there is one single data point in the Vostock core
(1999 data set) that shows an anomalous temperature, and from this you
conclude that “the average global temperature 400 years ago was significantly
higher than now”! One data point from one location does not an “average global
temperature” give. The pukka science carefully collects a range of proxy data
from multiple sources using many different methodologies, taken from as many
places on Earth as possible to assess careful paleoproxy temperature data that
is truly globally (or at least hemispherically) averaged. You (having other
fish to fry one suspects than assessing the best possible understanding from
the available data) base your entire analysis on one data point, from one data
set from one location on Earth. Oh dear!

And so on. Happily the individuals and organizations that address these issues
maturely and seriously don't fall for that sort of nonsense....

[***] In fairness to Christopher Scotese, his site is quite good. He does need
to update his paleotemperature graph though!

Chris:  
Your assertion “…talk a lot of nonsense…” may reveal that you simply do not
understand how feedback works. The graphs in the Middlebury link are plots of
data from NOAA and other credible sources. They speak for themselves and are
as correct as the data sources.

Apparently you accept Scotese’s temperatures. The carbon dioxide level at that
time is from GEOCARB III as published in the American Journal of Science. The
graph at
http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/Image:Phanerozoic_Carbon_Dioxide_png
shows a lot of illogical scatter in Royer’s compilation but fair agreement
between 30Myr filtered Royer, Copse and GEOCARB III. I have found no rational
argument as to why the atmospheric carbon dioxide level should dramatically
change prior to the temperature dropping into that ice age. The assertion
remains that the temperature dropped while the carbon dioxide level was
several times higher than now.

The graph of CO2 and average global temperature during the Phanerozoic (all of
the time that there have been complex life forms, the last 550 million or so
years) at http://mysite.verizon.net/mhieb/WVFossils/Carboniferous_climate.html
is as good as any. A lot of imagination is needed to see any correlation there
between atmospheric carbon dioxide and average global temperature.

You say “the warming oceans release CO2 into the atmosphere resulting in
further warming”. That would be a ramp up in temperature. But then the ramp up
changed direction and became a ramp down. And this direction change in
temperature trend happened repeatedly during the last and previous
glaciations. That could not happen if there was significant net positive
feedback.

For those who understand how feedback works, this temperature trend direction
change proves that there is no significant net positive feedback. All that is
needed to determine if there is net positive feedback is a temperature trace
for a long enough time to average out cyclic variation from random noise and
other factors. The temperature trace does not even need to be correct in
absolute terms just reasonably accurate in relative terms time-wise. Without
significant net positive feedback added atmospheric carbon dioxide does not
produce significant increase in average global temperature. Even the flawed
GCMs give that result. Those who think they “…know about greenhouse gases and
their effects…” apparently do not recognize the significance of this
observation.

While determination of the magnitude and even the sign of net feedback in
climate may be difficult using climatology (Spencer at a link in 41 above and
also Monckton at http://www.aps.org/units/fps/newsletters/200807/monckton.cfm
have done it), it is trivial, as described above, for someone who understands
feedback, to deduce from the temperature record that net positive feedback
does not exist. Many climatologists apparently don't know how feedback works
so they don't realize this. Unaware of their ignorance, they impose
significant net positive feedback in their GCMs which causes them to predict
substantial warming from carbon dioxide increase. Without significant net
positive feedback, the GCMs do not predict significant Global Warming. From
Monckton’s paper “The IPCC overstates temperature feedbacks to such an extent
that the sum of the high-end values that it has now, for the first time,
quantified would cross the instability threshold in the Bode feedback equation
and induce a runaway greenhouse effect that has not occurred even in
geological times despite CO2 concentrations almost 20 times today’s, and
temperatures up to 7 ºC higher than today’s.”  
Do you realize how many times you said in 46 that the sun started it? These
were extracted from your text: “…insolation changes…”, “…primary inducer of
the warming is increased solar radiation…”, “…decreased [s]olar insolation
resulted in cooling…”, “…one “lowers the heater” that the Earth cools…” Solar
variation is certainly a major part of it. Of the list of other possible
contributors to climate change, some ignored, some subjectively parameterized;
solar wind, clouds, vertical convection, cosmic rays, Milankovitch cycles,
etc. and factors not yet discovered, only significant net positive feedback is
readily ruled out. Influencing any of the others doesn’t look promising.
Humanity needs to adapt to climate change. Warming is not a problem. If it
gets too hot or wet or dry where you are at, move. There are currently places
that lack permanent occupancy because they are too hot, too cold, too wet or
too dry. Half of humanity may starve in the coming glaciation, however,
because rice does not grow on ice.

The high rate of change of the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide today is
not relevant to climate change since the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide
has no significant influence on climate. Eventually, excess atmospheric carbon
dioxide will dissolve in the ocean which already holds over 50 times as much
as the atmosphere. Interestingly, I have read that the rate of increase of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is about half of what is calculated based on
the amount added by humanity.

In your lawyer-like advocacy and nitpicking of the scarcity of paleo data you
appear to have completely missed the point of temperature trend reversals
ruling out net positive feedback. I suggest that you break out of the box that
you are in, adopt engineer/scientist-like objectivity and learn about
feedback.

There are legitimate reasons to constrain the use of fossil fuels. As the
level of atmospheric carbon dioxide continues to increase, and it will, humans
may find enclosed places becoming ‘stuffy’ sooner than previously. The
consumer price rise of liquid fuels as a result of ‘peak oil’ will curtail
their use and stimulate alternate fuels such as algae produced biodiesel. I
have been antagonistic to coal for decades and am suspicious of claims that
mercury, soot and acid can be effectively removed from the exhaust. When
humanity gets past their unjustified paranoia regarding nuclear power and
start building breeder reactors they will have all of the energy needed for
millions of years. Enough to recharge their hybrids and even synthesize liquid
fuel to go beyond battery range.

Re #47

No Scotese's temperatures are horribly incorrect (that's obvious surely). It's
not clear where they came from (can you enlighten us?), and they clearly bear
little relation to reality or to the paleotemperature data that is compiled
extensively in the recent scientific literature (see citations at bottom of
post for example).

Try using Google Scholar or visit .edu sites (or your local University library
- there are a number of relevant papers at the bottom of this post). In
addressing scientific issues, one should address the science.

["The graph of CO2 and average global temperature during the Phanerozoic (all
of the time that there have been complex life forms, the last 550 million or
so years) at
http://mysite.verizon.net/mhieb/WVFossils/Carboniferous_climate.html is as
good as any."]

No it isn't. Sadly it's a laughable parody of the data that has been complied
in a large number of studies, and it's surprising that someone with an
apparent interest in this subject would consider it to be so in the light of
the abundant scientific data on this subject (see citations at bottom of this
post). Obviously if one puts together a completely false representation of the
scientific data on paleoCO2 and paleotemperature one shouldn't be surprised if
one is led to fallacious interpretations.

And suggesting that pointing out gross misrepresentation of the science based
on ludicrously inadequate graphs using unspecified data on dubious websites
with contrived misinterpretation, is "Lawyerlike advocacy and nit-picking", is
a delightful lu-lu!

As for feedbacks, I suspect you've managed to be misinformed through poor
analysis or the perusal of dodgy sources (Christopher Monckton? isn't this
supposed to be about science?). There's no question that raising atmospheric
CO2 levels results in a re-equilbration of the Earth's temperature such that
internal variations fluctuate around a higher equilibrium temperature
(assuming volcanic/solar contributions are flattish), and that this involves
feedbacks (e.g. a warmer atmosphere caused by enhanced atmospheric CO2 results
in a higher concentration of water vapour.....enhanced warming results in
enhanced ice melt and reduced albedo and so on)... The science indicates that
the Earth responds to raised CO2 with a raised equilibrium surface temperature
near 3 oC (+/- a bit).

I'm not sure why you have a problem with this and feedbacks in general.
Clearly during ice age cycles the dominant driver is cyclic variations in
insolation due to slow variations in the Earth's orbital properties. It only
requires that the insolation cycles dominate over the effects of CO2
(feedbacks included) to observe the relationships between temperature and CO2
levels in the Vostock core that you are so exercised over. If CO2 levels rise
from 180-280 ppm over thousands of years(due to very slow solar induced
warming) resulting in enhanced direct CO2 (greenhouse) warming with fast
positive water vapour feedbacks and slower albedo feedbacks, and then the
solar contribution diminishes, much of the atmospheric CO2 will still be there
(for hundreds of years) as the temperature cools in the early stages of the
next Milankovitch cooling cycle. And as the temperature cools due to decreased
insolation, so the water vapour levels drop, even as CO2 levels remain high.
That's not difficult to understand at all..

You make some other very odd comments. Yes, high levels of atmospheric CO2
will eventually be drawn out of the atmosphere. This is a very slow process
(your own Vostock data show this). And of course "the rate of increase of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is about half of what is calculated based on
the amount added by humanity." Half of the CO2 we've released into the
atmosphere has been absorbed by the oceans with a very measurable drop in pH
(increased acidity).....already the absorption of our emissions by the oceans
is decreasing due to the saturation of the upper oceanic waters. Each of these
is problematic.

All in all, you've chosen to use ludicrous data from some website to pursue
the unsupported notion that there isn't a relationship between atmospheric CO2
lelvels and the earth's global temperature. And yet the science clearly shows
otherwise (e.g. papers cited below). No one disputes the fact that CO2 is a
greenhouse gas, and greenhouse gases cause the Earth to warm above its black
body temperature (by around 30 oC worth of warming on Earth). Or do you
consider that CO2 stops being a greenhouse gas above some concentration or
other?

Anyway, here's some of the science that one would hope you might access in
place of dodgy websites:

The Andean-Saharan issue is simple. The ice age happened and the carbon
dioxide level was much higher than now when it started. The chart uses data
compiled by Christopher R. Scotese, Ph.D., University of Chicago, 1985,
currently an Associate Professor geologist at the University of Texas at
Arlington. Research interests include plate tectonics, paleogeography, and
paleoclimatology and R. A. Berner, Department of Geology and Geophysics, Yale
University. Contrary to your implication, they are university scientists.

My understanding of feedback in a complex system comes from having an advanced
degree in Mechanical Engineering and many years of engineering practice
including rocketry, nuclear power, and meteorological satellites. Many
engineers understand and successfully apply feedback in complex systems and
have for many decades. Although climatologists use a somewhat different
formulation, the end result is the same.

Your discussion of feedback verifies that you don’t understand feedback very
well. That explains why you don’t recognize that the temperature trend
reversals during the previous glaciation (not talking about 100,000 year ice
age cycles here) prove that significant net positive feedback does not exist
in climate.

If you use the same argument regarding the temperature trend reversals as you
use for changes from glacial to interglacial then all temperature trends would
be reversed by unpredictable solar changes which would make GCMs useless as
climate predictors.

I am puzzled as to why you call some of my comments “very odd” and then
proceed to agree with them.

The data that you disparagingly refer to as ludicrous is well referenced and
came from NOAA as you could have easily discovered.

I say that there is no significant net positive feedback and you claim that I
said “there isn't a relationship between atmospheric CO2 lelvels and the
earth's global temperature”. Some scientists express their interpretations and
you say “science says”. More scientists and engineers are on record declaring
that atmospheric carbon dioxide level has no significant influence on climate
than there are saying that it does (Not that it matters).

Oh dear...

You don't seem to get it:

(1) There is unfortuantely no paleoCO2 proxy that coincides in time with the
late Ordovician paleoevidence for glaciation. Therefore we don't know the
relationship between paleoCO2 and paleotemperature for that particular event.
There's no point in pretending otherwise.

(ii) Pretty much every case where we do have contemporaneous paleoCO2 and
paleotemperature temperature proxies, the relationship between atmospheric CO2
and temperature is rather clear. See the list of scientific papers in my post

# 48.

(iii) If one want's to assess scientific issues, one goes to the published
science, not to dodgy outdated, and unattributed pictures on websites.

(iv) Christopher Scotese seems a perfectly excellent chap. However his website
was last updated around 2002, and his site is principally to illustrate
tectonic effects on continental movement. Sadly his site happens to contain a
completely incorrect graph of paleotemperature data. It's more of a child-like
crude sketch. I've no idea where it comes from...(can you enlighten us?)

(v) I've shown you a long list of papers, including a recent review that
compiles all of the data up to around 2005/6. Unfortunately, rather than
taking the effort to explore the science on this subject, you prefer to argue
over a crude unattributed graph that is clearly incorrect....go figure!

(vi) You have an advanced degree on Mechanical Engineering and so on...and yet
you have spent an apparently significant eforrt in putting together a web page
full of the most blatant misrepresentations. While real scientists assess
multipile paleotemperature data sets obtained with many different methods from
as many places on the earth as possible to obtain truly global (or at least
hemispheric) paleotemperature estimates, you choose ONE data point, in ONE
data set, from ONE place on Earth and presume to aseet that 400 years ago the
globally averaged temperature was higher than now...

(vii) Even though that's a dismal piece of misrepresentation, and Scotese's
temperature data is clearly incorrect, and your arguments about feedbacks have
no basis in science......

..you are still asserting that you are right on these matters whereas all the
climate, meterological, ocean, paleoenvironmental scientisits and so on are
all incorrect....

I don't think so Dan.....why not make an effort to access the science on these
issues. I've given you a wealth of sources that bear exactly on the subjuect
of issue that containis the most up to date data.

Oh dear is right . . .

Graphs of source referenced NOAA data are presented and you see “blatant
misrepresentation”.

The proof that significant net positive feedback and therefore AGW does not
exist does not use Holocene data but you persist in worrying about a specific
data point.

You point out that other scientist’s have different interpretations of the
Andean-Saharan ice age and you have decided which ones you agree with. Perhaps
you do not realize that A/S is also not a necessary consideration to prove
that significant net positive feedback does not exist in climate. The Scotese-
Berner assessment of A/S defrays concern for planet-wide runaway temperature
rise but the logarithmic decline in infrared radiation intensity with distance
from the radiating surface with what is called the ‘saturation’ effect of
atmospheric carbon dioxide refutes the ‘tipping point’ nonsense without any
other consideration.

Apparently you still don’t understand how feedback works. Perhaps we are not
communicating. Let’s try a specific example. Look at the temperature trend
from 55,000 ybp to 50,000 ybp. (This is from NOAA Vostok data as graphed in
the second graph on the Middlebury website but the EPICA core shows about the
same only shifted slightly in time.) See that this uptrend changes to a down
trend at 50,000 ybp. This downtrend continues until about 45,000 ybp. This
direction change from an up trend to a down trend could not take place if
there were significant net positive feedback. Now look at the rest of the
graph and see that there are many similar examples.

Only the few who still believe that the rising atmospheric carbon dioxide
level will have a significant effect on average global temperature are
incorrect.

Learn about feedback and then read 45 again.

Don't be silly Dan,

It's you that is "worrying about a specific data point"

or actually two specific data points.

NUMBER ONE:

I am basing my understanding of the strong relationship between paleoCO2
measures and paleotemperature measures right back through the last 500 million
years, BASED ON HUNDREDS OF CONTEMPORANEOUS CO2 and TEMP MEASURES (see data in
my references cited in the posts above)

You are taking one specific part of the paleodat where there is evidence for
glaciation (i.e a coolish/cold Earth) and assuming that there is no
relationship with atmospheric CO2. However THERE IS NO CONTEMPORANEOUS PALEO-
CO2 MEASURE THAT OVERLAPS THIS PERIOD...and therefore your focus on a specific
data point is spurious.

NUMBER 2:

I am basing my understanding of the paleotemperature data of the last 2000
years which indicates that late 20th century and contemporary warming is well
above anything experienced during this time period. THIS DATA IS BAED ON
NUMEROUS DATA SETS USING NUMEROUS METHODS OBTAINED FROM MANY DIFERENT PLACES
ON EARTH.

You are making a blatant misrepresentation of the data by basing your
interpretation on ONE data point, from, ONE location, using ONE method.

For some reason you're trying to construct a whole edifice of
misrepresentation based on single data points.

And for some reason, despite your assertions of scientific credentials you
can't seem to grasp that primary effects (raised CO2 levels) supplemented with
feedbacks can be overpowered by other effects (reduced insolation during
waning Milankovitch cycles)...

..your blatant fallacious misinterpretations of paleodata don't actually give
us very much confidence in your misassertions aboutfeedbacks...
