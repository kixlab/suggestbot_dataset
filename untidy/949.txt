In chemistry, an **alcohol** is any organic compound in which the hydroxyl
functional group (–OH) is bound to a carbon.[2] The term alcohol originally
referred to the primary alcohol ethanol (ethyl alcohol), which is used as a
drug and is the main alcohol present in alcoholic beverages. An important
class of alcohols, of which methanol and ethanol are the simplest members,
includes all compounds for which the general formula is C nH2n+1OH. It is
these simple monoalcohols that are the subject of this article.

The suffix _-ol_ appears in the IUPAC chemical name of all substances where
the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority. When a
higher priority group is present in the compound, the prefix _hydroxy-_ is
used in its IUPAC name. The suffix _-ol_ in non-IUPAC names (such as
paracetamol or cholesterol) also typically indicates that the substance is an
alcohol. However, many substances that contain hydroxyl functional groups
(particularly sugars, such as glucose and sucrose) have names which include
neither the suffix _-ol_ , nor the prefix _hydroxy-_.

## History

Alcohol distillation likely originated in India. During 2000 BCE, people of
India used an alcoholic drink called _Sura_.[3] Alcohol distillation was known
to Islamic chemists as early as the eighth century.[4][5]

The Arab chemist, al-Kindi, unambiguously described the distillation of wine
in a treatise titled as "The Book of the chemistry of Perfume and
Distillations".[6][7][8]

The Persian physician, alchemist, polymath and philosopher Rhazes (854 CE –
925 CE)[9] is credited with the discovery of ethanol.[10][11]

## Nomenclature

### Etymology

The word "alcohol" is from the Arabic _kohl_ (Arabic: الكحل, romanized: _al-
kuḥl_ ), a powder used as an eyeliner.[12] Al- is the Arabic definite article,
equivalent to _the_ in English. _Alcohol_ was originally used for the very
fine powder produced by the sublimation of the natural mineral stibnite to
form antimony trisulfide Sb  
2S  
3\. It was considered to be the essence or "spirit" of this mineral. It was
used as an antiseptic, eyeliner, and cosmetic. The meaning of alcohol was
extended to distilled substances in general, and then narrowed to ethanol,
when "spirits" was a synonym for hard liquor.[13]

Bartholomew Traheron, in his 1543 translation of John of Vigo, introduces the
word as a term used by "barbarous" (Moorish) authors for "fine powder." Vigo
wrote: "the barbarous auctours use alcohol, or (as I fynde it sometymes
wryten) alcofoll, for moost fine poudre."[14]

The 1657 _Lexicon Chymicum_ , by William Johnson glosses the word as
"antimonium sive stibium."[15] By extension, the word came to refer to any
fluid obtained by distillation, including "alcohol of wine," the distilled
essence of wine. Libavius in _Alchymia_ (1594) refers to "vini alcohol vel
vinum alcalisatum". Johnson (1657) glosses _alcohol vini_ as "quando omnis
superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum
consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat." The word's
meaning became restricted to "spirit of wine" (the chemical known today as
ethanol) in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so-
called as "alcohols" in modern chemistry after 1850.[14]

The term _ethanol_ was invented 1892, combining the word ethane with the "-ol"
ending of "alcohol".[16]

### Systematic names

IUPAC nomenclature is used in scientific publications and where precise
identification of the substance is important, especially in cases where the
relative complexity of the molecule does not make such a systematic name
unwieldy. In naming simple alcohols, the name of the alkane chain loses the
terminal _e_ and adds the suffix _-ol_ , _e.g._ , as in "ethanol" from the
alkane chain name "ethane".[17] When necessary, the position of the hydroxyl
group is indicated by a number between the alkane name and the _-ol_ :
propan-1-ol for CH  
3CH  
2CH  
2OH, propan-2-ol for CH  
3CH(OH)CH  
3\. If a higher priority group is present (such as an aldehyde, ketone, or
carboxylic acid), then the prefix _hydroxy-_ is used,[17] e.g., as in
1-hydroxy-2-propanone (CH  
3C(O)CH  
2OH).[18]

In cases where the OH functional group is bonded to an sp2 carbon on an
aromatic ring the molecule is known as a phenol, and is named using the IUPAC
rules for naming phenols.[19]

### Common names

In other less formal contexts, an alcohol is often called with the name of the
corresponding alkyl group followed by the word "alcohol", e.g., methyl
alcohol, ethyl alcohol. Propyl alcohol may be _n_ -propyl alcohol or isopropyl
alcohol, depending on whether the hydroxyl group is bonded to the end or
middle carbon on the straight propane chain. As described under systematic
naming, if another group on the molecule takes priority, the alcohol moiety is
often indicated using the "hydroxy-" prefix.[20]

Alcohols are then classified into primary, secondary ( _sec-_ , _s-_ ), and
tertiary ( _tert-_ , _t-_ ), based upon the number of carbon atoms connected
to the carbon atom that bears the hydroxyl functional group. (The respective
numeric shorthands 1°, 2°, and 3° are also sometimes used in informal
settings.[21]) The primary alcohols have general formulas RCH2OH. The simplest
primary alcohol is methanol (CH3OH), for which R=H, and the next is ethanol,
for which R=CH3, the methyl group. Secondary alcohols are those of the form
RR'CHOH, the simplest of which is 2-propanol (R=R'=CH3). For the tertiary
alcohols the general form is RR'R"COH. The simplest example is tert-butanol
(2-methylpropan-2-ol), for which each of R, R', and R" is CH3. In these
shorthands, R, R', and R" represent substituents, alkyl or other attached,
generally organic groups.

In archaic nomenclature, alcohols can be named as derivatives of methanol
using "-carbinol" as the ending. For instance, (CH3)3COH can be named
trimethylcarbinol.

## Applications

Alcohol_by_Country.png)

Total recorded alcohol per capita consumption (15+), in litres of pure
ethanol[22]

Alcohols have a long history of myriad uses. For simple mono-alcohols, which
is the focus on this article, the following are most important industrial
alcohols:[23]

  * methanol, mainly for the production of formaldehyde and as a fuel additive
  * ethanol, mainly for alcoholic beverages, fuel additive, solvent
  * 1-propanol, 1-butanol, and isobutyl alcohol for use as a solvent and precursor to solvents
  * C6–C11 alcohols used for plasticizers, e.g. in polyvinylchloride
  * fatty alcohol (C12–C18), precursors to detergents

Methanol is the most common industrial alcohol, with about 12 million tons/y
produced in 1980. The combined capacity of the other alcohols is about the
same, distributed roughly equally.[23]

## Toxicity

Main articles: ethanol and methanol

With respect to acute toxicity, simple alcohols have low acute toxicities.
Doses of several milliliters are tolerated. For pentanols, hexanols, octanols
and longer alcohols, LD50 range from 2–5 g/kg (rats, oral). Methanol and
ethanol are less acutely toxic. All alcohols are mild skin irritants.[23]

The metabolism of methanol (and ethylene glycol) is affected by the presence
of ethanol, which has a higher affinity for liver alcohol dehydrogenase. In
this way methanol will be excreted intact in urine.[24][25][26]

## Physical properties

In general, the hydroxyl group makes alcohols polar. Those groups can form
hydrogen bonds to one another and to most other compounds. Owing to the
presence of the polar OH alcohols are more water-soluble than simple
hydrocarbons. Methanol, ethanol, and propanol are miscible in water. Butanol,
with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble.

Because of hydrogen bonding, alcohols tend to have higher boiling points than
comparable hydrocarbons and ethers. The boiling point of the alcohol ethanol
is 78.29 °C, compared to 69 °C for the hydrocarbon hexane, and 34.6 °C for
diethyl ether.

## Occurrence in nature

Simple alcohols are found widely in nature. Ethanol is most prominent because
it is the product of fermentation, a major energy-producing pathway. The other
simple alcohols are formed in only trace amounts. More complex alcohols are
pervasive, as manifested in sugars, some amino acids, and fatty acids.

## Production

### Ziegler and oxo processes

In the Ziegler process, linear alcohols are produced from ethylene and
triethylaluminium followed by oxidation and hydrolysis.[23] An idealized
synthesis of 1-octanol is shown:

    
    
    Al(C2H5)3 \+ 9 C2H4 → Al(C8H17)3
    Al(C8H17)3 \+ 3 O + 3 H2O → 3 HOC8H17 \+ Al(OH)3
    

The process generates a range of alcohols that are separated by distillation.

Many higher alcohols are produced by hydroformylation of alkenes followed by
hydrogenation. When applied to a terminal alkene, as is common, one typically
obtains a linear alcohol:[23]

    
    
    RCH=CH2 \+ H2 \+ CO → RCH2CH2CHO
    RCH2CH2CHO + 3 H2 → RCH2CH2CH2OH
    

Such processes give fatty alcohols, which are useful for detergents.

### Hydration reactions

Some low molecular weight alcohols of industrial importance are produced by
the addition of water to alkenes. Ethanol, isopropanol, 2-butanol, and tert-
butanol are produced by this general method. Two implementations are employed,
the direct and indirect methods. The direct method avoids the formation of
stable intermediates, typically using acid catalysts. In the indirect method,
the alkene is converted to the sulfate ester, which is subsequently
hydrolyzed. The direct hydration using ethylene (ethylene hydration)[27] or
other alkenes from cracking of fractions of distilled crude oil.

Hydration is also used industrially to produce the diol ethylene glycol from
ethylene oxide.

### Biological routes

Ethanol is obtained by fermentation using glucose produced from sugar from the
hydrolysis of starch, in the presence of yeast and temperature of less than 37
°C to produce ethanol. For instance, such a process might proceed by the
conversion of sucrose by the enzyme invertase into glucose and fructose, then
the conversion of glucose by the enzyme complex zymase into ethanol (and
carbon dioxide).

Several species of the benign bacteria in the intestine use fermentation as a
form of anaerobic metabolism. This metabolic reaction produces ethanol as a
waste product. Thus, human bodies contain some quantity of alcohol
endogenously produced by these bacteria. In rare cases, this can be sufficient
to cause "auto-brewery syndrome" in which intoxicating quantities of alcohol
are produced.[28][29][30]

Like ethanol, butanol can be produced by fermentation processes. Saccharomyces
yeast are known to produce these higher alcohols at temperatures above 75 °F
(24 °C). The bacterium _Clostridium acetobutylicum_ can feed on cellulose to
produce butanol on an industrial scale.[31]

#### Substitution

Primary alkyl halides react with aqueous NaOH or KOH mainly to primary
alcohols in nucleophilic aliphatic substitution. (Secondary and especially
tertiary alkyl halides will give the elimination (alkene) product instead).
Grignard reagents react with carbonyl groups to secondary and tertiary
alcohols. Related reactions are the Barbier reaction and the Nozaki-Hiyama
reaction.

#### Reduction

Aldehydes or ketones are reduced with sodium borohydride or lithium aluminium
hydride (after an acidic workup). Another reduction by aluminiumisopropylates
is the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction. Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation is
the asymmetric reduction of β-keto-esters.

#### Hydrolysis

Alkenes engage in an acid catalysed hydration reaction using concentrated
sulfuric acid as a catalyst that gives usually secondary or tertiary alcohols.
The hydroboration-oxidation and oxymercuration-reduction of alkenes are more
reliable in organic synthesis. Alkenes react with NBS and water in halohydrin
formation reaction. Amines can be converted to diazonium salts, which are then
hydrolyzed.

The formation of a secondary alcohol via reduction and hydration is shown:

    
    
    ![Preparation of a secondary alcohol](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Secondary_alcohol_formation-diagram.svg/350px-Secondary_alcohol_formation-diagram.svg.png)
    

## Reactions

### Deprotonation

With a pKa of around 16–19, they are, in general, slightly weaker acids than
water. With strong bases such as sodium hydride or sodium they form salts
called **alkoxides** , with the general formula RO− M+.

    
    
    2 R-OH + 2 NaH → 2 R-O−Na+ \+ 2 H2
    2 R-OH + 2 Na → 2 R-O−Na+ \+ H2
    

The acidity of alcohols is strongly affected by solvation. In the gas phase,
alcohols are more acidic than is water.[32]

### Nucleophilic substitution

The OH group is not a good leaving group in nucleophilic substitution
reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions. However, if the
oxygen is first protonated to give R−OH2+, the leaving group (water) is much
more stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance,
tertiary alcohols react with hydrochloric acid to produce tertiary alkyl
halides, where the hydroxyl group is replaced by a chlorine atom by
unimolecular nucleophilic substitution. If primary or secondary alcohols are
to be reacted with hydrochloric acid, an activator such as zinc chloride is
needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using
thionyl chloride.[1]

![Some simple conversions of alcohols to alkyl

chlorides](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Alcohol_reaction_examples.gif/700px-

Alcohol_reaction_examples.gif)

Alcohols may, likewise, be converted to alkyl bromides using hydrobromic acid
or phosphorus tribromide, for example:

    
    
    3 R-OH + PBr3 → 3 RBr + H3PO3
    

In the Barton-McCombie deoxygenation an alcohol is deoxygenated to an alkane
with tributyltin hydride or a trimethylborane-water complex in a radical
substitution reaction.

### Dehydration

Meanwhile, the oxygen atom has lone pairs of nonbonded electrons that render
it weakly basic in the presence of strong acids such as sulfuric acid. For
example, with methanol:

![Acidity & basicity of

methanol](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Methanol_acid_base.svg/500px-

Methanol_acid_base.svg.png)

Upon treatment with strong acids, alcohols undergo the E1 elimination reaction
to produce alkenes. The reaction, in general, obeys Zaitsev's Rule, which
states that the most stable (usually the most substituted) alkene is formed.
Tertiary alcohols eliminate easily at just above room temperature, but primary
alcohols require a higher temperature.

This is a diagram of acid catalysed dehydration of ethanol to produce
ethylene:

![DehydrationOfAlcoholWithH-.png](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/DehydrationOfAlcoholWithH-.png/550px-

DehydrationOfAlcoholWithH-.png)

A more controlled elimination reaction is the with carbon disulfide and
iodomethane.

### Esterification

Alcohol and carboxylic acids react in the so-called Fischer esterification.
The reaction usually requires a catalyst, such as concentrated sulfuric acid:

    
    
    R-OH + R'-CO2H → R'-CO2R + H2O
    

Other types of ester are prepared in a similar manner - for example, tosyl
(tosylate) esters are made by reaction of the alcohol with p-toluenesulfonyl
chloride in pyridine.

### Oxidation

Main article: Alcohol oxidation

Primary alcohols (R-CH2OH) can be oxidized either to aldehydes (R-CHO) or to
carboxylic acids (R-CO2H). The oxidation of secondary alcohols (R1R2CH-OH)
normally terminates at the ketone (R1R2C=O) stage. Tertiary alcohols
(R1R2R3C-OH) are resistant to oxidation.

The direct oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids normally proceeds
via the corresponding aldehyde, which is transformed via an _aldehyde hydrate_
(R-CH(OH) 2) by reaction with water before it can be further oxidized to the
carboxylic acid.

Alcohol_to_aldehyde_to_acid.png)

Mechanism of oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids via aldehydes
and aldehyde hydrates

Reagents useful for the transformation of primary alcohols to aldehydes are
normally also suitable for the oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones.
These include Collins reagent and Dess-Martin periodinane. The direct
oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids can be carried out using
potassium permanganate or the Jones reagent.
