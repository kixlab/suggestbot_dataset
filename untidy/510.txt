Sea level rise since the Last Glacial Maximum.

Global or eustatic sea level has fluctuated significantly over the Earth's
history. The main factors affecting sea level are the amount and volume of
available water and the shape and volume of the ocean basins. The primary
influences on water volume are the temperature of the seawater, which affects
density, and the amounts of water retained in other reservoirs like rivers,
aquifers, lakes, glaciers, polar ice caps and sea ice. Over geological
timescales, changes in the shape of the oceanic basins and in land/sea
distribution affect sea level. In addition to eustatic changes, local changes
in sea level are caused by tectonic uplift and subsidence.

Over geologic time sea level has fluctuated by more than 300 metres, possibly
more than 400 metres. The main reason for sea level fluctuations is the
Antarctic ice sheet and Antarctic post-glacial rebound during warm periods.

The current sea level is about 130 metres higher than the historical minimum.
Historically low levels were reached during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM),
about 20,000 years ago. The last time the sea level was higher than today was
during the Eemian, about 130,000 years ago.[2]

Over a shorter timescale, the low level reached during the LGM rebounded in
the early Holocene, between about 14,000 and 6,000 years ago, and sea levels
have been comparably stable over the past 6,000 years. Observational and
modeling studies of mass loss from glaciers and ice caps indicate a
contribution to a sea-level rise of 2 to 4 cm over the 20th century. Based on
orbital models, the cooling trend initiated about 6,000 years ago will
continue for another 23,000 years. It is possible, however, that a "next
glacial maximum" will be reached only in about 100,000 years, with a possible
warm period in 60,000 years.[3][4]

## Glaciers and ice caps[edit]

Each year about 8 mm (0.3 inches) of water from the entire surface of the
oceans falls onto the Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets as snowfall. If no
ice returned to the oceans, sea level would drop 8 mm (0.3 in) every year. To
a first approximation, the same amount of water appeared to return to the
ocean in icebergs and from ice melting at the edges. Scientists previously had
estimated which is greater, ice going in or coming out, called the mass
balance, important because it causes changes in global sea level. High-
precision gravimetry from satellites in low-noise flight has since determined
that in 2006, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets experienced a combined
mass loss of 475 ± 158 Gt/yr, equivalent to 1.3 ± 0.4 mm/yr sea level rise.
Notably, the acceleration in ice sheet loss from 1988–2006 was 21.9 ± 1 Gt/yr²
for Greenland and 14.5 ± 2 Gt/yr² for Antarctica, for a combined total of 36.3
± 2 Gt/yr². This acceleration is 3 times larger than for mountain glaciers and
ice caps (12 ± 6 Gt/yr²).[5]

Ice shelves float on the surface of the sea and, if they melt, to first order
they do not change sea level. Likewise, the melting of the northern polar ice
cap which is composed of floating pack ice would not significantly contribute
to rising sea levels. However, because floating ice pack is lower in salinity
than seawater, their melting would cause a very small increase in sea levels,
so small that it is generally neglected.[ _citation needed_ ]

                    
                                                * Scientists previously lacked knowledge of changes in terrestrial storage of water. Surveying of water retention by soil absorption and by artificial reservoirs ("impoundment") show that a total of about 10,800 cubic kilometres (2,591 cubic miles) of water (just under the size of Lake Huron) has been impounded on land to date. Such impoundment masked about 30 mm (1.2 in) of sea level rise in that time.[6]
                            * Conversely estimates of excess global groundwater extraction during 1900–2008 totals ∼4,500 km3, equivalent to a sea-level rise of 12.6 mm (0.50 in) (>6% of the total). Furthermore, the rate of groundwater depletion has increased markedly since about 1950, with maximum rates occurring during the most recent period (2000–2008), when it averaged ∼145 km3/yr (equivalent to 0.40 mm/yr of sea-level rise, or 13% of the reported rate of 3.1 mm/yr during this recent period).[7]
                            * If small glaciers and polar ice caps on the margins of Greenland and the Antarctic Peninsula melt, the projected rise in sea level will be around 0.5 m (1 ft 7.7 in). Melting of the Greenland ice sheet would produce 7.2 m (23.6 ft) of sea-level rise, and melting of the Antarctic ice sheet would produce 61.1 m (200.5 ft) of sea level rise.[8] The collapse of the grounded interior reservoir of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would raise sea level by 5 m (16.4 ft) - 6 m (19.7 ft).[9]
                            * The snowline altitude is the altitude of the lowest elevation interval in which minimum annual snow cover exceeds 50%. This ranges from about 5,500 metres (18,045 feet) above sea-level at the equator down to sea level at about 70° N&S latitude, depending on regional temperature amelioration effects. Permafrost then appears at sea level and extends deeper below sea level polewards.
                            * As most of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets lie above the snowline and/or base of the permafrost zone, they cannot melt in a timeframe much less than several millennia[ _citation needed_ ]; therefore it is likely that they will not, through melting, contribute significantly to sea level rise in the coming century.[ _dubious - discuss_] They can, however, do so through acceleration in flow and enhanced iceberg calving.
                            * Climate changes during the 20th century are estimated from modelling studies to have led to contributions of between −0.2 and 0.0 mm/yr from Antarctica (the results of increasing precipitation) and 0.0 to 0.1 mm/yr from Greenland (from changes in both precipitation and runoff).[ _citation needed_ ]
                            * Estimates suggest that Greenland and Antarctica have contributed 0.0 to 0.5 mm/yr over the 20th century as a result of long-term adjustment to the end of the last ice age.
                    

The current rise in sea level observed from tide gauges, of about 1.8 mm/yr,
is within the estimate range from the combination of factors above,[10] but
active research continues in this field. The terrestrial storage term, thought
to be highly uncertain, is no longer positive, and shown to be quite large.

## Geological influences[edit]

At times during Earth's long history, the configuration of the continents and
sea floor has changed due to plate tectonics. This affects global sea level by
altering the depths of various ocean basins and also by altering glacier
distribution with resulting changes in glacial-interglacial cycles. Changes in
glacial-interglacial cycles are at least partially affected by changes in
glacier distributions across the a Earth.

The depth of the ocean basins is a function of the age of oceanic lithosphere
(the tectonic plates beneath the floors of the world's oceans). As older
plates age, they become denser and sink, allowing newer plates to rise and
take their place. Therefore, a configuration with many small oceanic plates
that rapidly recycle the oceanic lithosphere would produce shallower ocean
basins and (all other things being equal) higher sea levels. A configuration
with fewer plates and more cold, dense oceanic lithosphere, on the other hand,
would result in deeper ocean basins and lower sea levels.

When there was much continental crust near the poles, the rock record shows
unusually low sea levels during ice ages, because there was much polar land
mass on which snow and ice could accumulate. During times when the land masses
clustered around the equator, ice ages had much less effect on sea level.

Over most of geologic time, the long-term mean sea level has been higher than
today (see graph above). Only at the Permian-Triassic boundary ~250 million
years ago was the long-term mean sea level lower than today. Long term changes
in the mean sea level are the result of changes in the oceanic crust, with a
downward trend expected to continue in the very long term.[11]

During the glacial-interglacial cycles over the past few million years, the
mean sea level has varied by somewhat more than a hundred metres. This is
primarily due to the growth and decay of ice sheets (mostly in the northern
hemisphere) with water evaporated from the sea.

The Mediterranean Basin's gradual growth as the Neotethys basin, begun in the
Jurassic, did not suddenly affect ocean levels. While the Mediterranean was
forming during the past 100 million years, the average ocean level was
generally 200 metres above current levels. However, the largest known example
of marine flooding was when the Atlantic breached the Strait of Gibraltar at
the end of the Messinian Salinity Crisis about 5.2 million years ago. This
restored Mediterranean sea levels at the sudden end of the period when that
basin had dried up, apparently due to geologic forces in the area of the
Strait.

### Changes through geologic time [edit]

Sea level has changed over geologic time. As the graph shows, sea level today
is very near the lowest level ever attained (the lowest level occurred at the
Permian-Triassic boundary about 250 million years ago).

During the most recent ice age (at its maximum about 20,000 years ago) the
world's sea level was about 130 m lower than today, due to the large amount of
sea water that had evaporated and been deposited as snow and ice, mostly in
the Laurentide ice sheet. Most of this had melted by about 10,000 years ago.

Hundreds of similar glacial cycles have occurred throughout the Earth's
history. Geologists who study the positions of coastal sediment deposits
through time have noted dozens of similar basinward shifts of shorelines
associated with a later recovery. This results in sedimentary cycles which in
some cases can be correlated around the world with great confidence. This
relatively new branch of geological science linking eustatic sea level to
sedimentary deposits is called sequence stratigraphy.

The most up-to-date chronology of sea level change through the Phanerozoic
shows the following long-term trends:[13]

                    
                                                * Gradually rising sea level through the Cambrian
                            * Relatively stable sea level in the Ordovician, with a large drop associated with the end-Ordovician glaciation
                            * Relative stability at the lower level during the Silurian
                            * A gradual fall through the Devonian, continuing through the Mississippian to long-term low at the Mississippian/Pennsylvanian boundary
                            * A gradual rise until the start of the Permian, followed by a gentle decrease lasting until the Mesozoic.
                    

#### Sea level rise since the last glacial maximum[edit]

Further information: Early Holocene sea level rise

During deglaciation between about 19-8 ka, sea level rose at extremely high
rates as the result of the rapid melting of the British-Irish Sea,
Fennoscandian, Laurentide, Barents-Kara, Patagonian, Innuitian ice sheets and
parts of the Antarctic ice sheet. At the onset of deglaciation about 19,000
calendar years ago, a brief, at most 500-year long, glacio-eustatic event may
have contributed as much as 10 m to sea level with an average rate of about 20
mm/yr. During the rest of the early Holocene, the rate of sea level rise
varied from a low of about 6.0–9.9 mm/yr to as high as 30–60 mm/yr during
brief periods of accelerated sea level rise.[14][15]

Solid geological evidence, based largely upon analysis of deep cores of coral
reefs, exists only for 3 major periods of accelerated sea level rise, called
_meltwater pulses_ , during the last deglaciation. They are Meltwater pulse 1A
between circa 14,600 and 14,300 calendar years ago; Meltwater pulse 1B between
circa 11,400 and 11,100 calendar years ago; and Meltwater pulse 1C between
8,200 and 7,600 calendar years ago. Meltwater pulse 1A was a 13.5 m rise over
about 290 years centered at 14,200 calendar years ago and Meltwater pulse 1B
was a 7.5 m rise over about 160 years centered at 11,000 years calendar years
ago. In sharp contrast, the period between 14,300 and 11,100 calendar years
ago, which includes the Younger Dryas interval, was an interval of reduced sea
level rise at about 6.0–9.9 mm/yr. Meltwater pulse 1C was centered at 8,000
calendar years and produced a rise of 6.5 m in less than 140
years.[15][16][17] Such rapid rates of sea level rising during meltwater
events clearly implicate major ice-loss events related to ice sheet collapse.
The primary source may have been meltwater from the Antarctic ice sheet. Other
studies suggest a Northern Hemisphere source for the meltwater in the
Laurentide ice sheet.[17]

Recently, it has become widely accepted that late Holocene, 3,000 calendar
years ago to present, sea level was nearly stable prior to an acceleration of
rate of rise that is variously dated between 1850 and 1900 AD. Late Holocene
rates of sea level rise have been estimated using evidence from archaeological
sites and late Holocene tidal marsh sediments, combined with tide gauge and
satellite records and geophysical modeling. For example, this research
included studies of Roman wells in Caesarea and of Roman _piscinae_ in Italy.
These methods in combination suggest a mean eustatic component of 0.07 mm/yr
for the last 2000 years.[14]

Since 1880, the ocean began to rise briskly, climbing a total of 210 mm (8.3
in) through 2009 causing extensive erosion worldwide and costing
billions.[18][19]

Sea level rose by 6 cm during the 19th century and 19 cm in the 20th
century.[20] Evidence for this includes geological observations, the longest
instrumental records and the observed rate of 20th century sea level rise. For
example, geological observations indicate that during the last 2,000 years,
sea level change was small, with an average rate of only 0.0–0.2 mm per year.
This compares to an average rate of 1.7 ± 0.5 mm per year for the 20th
century.[21] Baart et al. (2012) show that it is important to account for the
effect of the 18.6-year lunar nodal cycle before acceleration in sea level
rise should be concluded.[22] Based on tide gauge data, the rate of global
average sea level rise during the 20th century lies in the range 0.8 to 3.3
mm/yr, with an average rate of 1.8 mm/yr.[23]
