# Medical marijuana

Posted January 15, 2018, 10:30 am , Updated June 05, 2019, 12:39 pm

![Peter Grinspoon, MD](https://hhp-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/02/Peter-

Grinspoon-Author-photo-for-Nancy-2-150x150.jpg)

Peter Grinspoon, MD  
Contributing Editor

![](https://hhp-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/02/iStock-116036237.jpg)

There are few subjects that can stir up stronger emotions among doctors,
scientists, researchers, policy makers, and the public than medical marijuana.
Is it safe? Should it be legal? Decriminalized? Has its effectiveness been
proven? What conditions is it useful for? Is it addictive? How do we keep it
out of the hands of teenagers? Is it really the “wonder drug” that people
claim it is? Is medical marijuana just a ploy to legalize marijuana in
general?

These are just a few of the excellent questions around this subject, questions
that I am going to studiously avoid so we can focus on two specific areas: why
do patients find it useful, and how can they discuss it with their doctor?

Marijuana is currently legal, on the state level, in 29 states, and in
Washington, DC. It is still illegal from the federal government's perspective.
The Obama administration did not make prosecuting medical marijuana even a
minor priority. President Donald Trump promised not to interfere with people
who use medical marijuana, though his administration is currently threatening
to reverse this policy. About 85% of Americans support legalizing medical
marijuana, and it is estimated that at least several million Americans
currently use it.

### Marijuana without the high

Least controversial is the extract from the hemp plant known as CBD (which
stands for cannabidiol) because this component of marijuana has little, if
any, intoxicating properties. Marijuana itself has more than 100 active
components. THC (which stands for tetrahydrocannabinol) is the chemical that
causes the “high” that goes along with marijuana consumption. CBD-dominant
strains have little or no THC, so patients report very little if any
alteration in consciousness.

Patients do, however, report many benefits of CBD, from relieving insomnia,
anxiety, spasticity, and pain to treating potentially life-threatening
conditions such as epilepsy. One particular form of childhood epilepsy called
Dravet syndrome is almost impossible to control, but responds dramatically to
a CBD-dominant strain of marijuana called Charlotte’s Web. The videos of this
are dramatic.

### Uses of medical marijuana

The most common use for medical marijuana in the United States is for pain
control. While marijuana isn’t strong enough for severe pain (for example,
post-surgical pain or a broken bone), it is quite effective for the chronic
pain that plagues millions of Americans, especially as they age. Part of its
allure is that it is clearly safer than opiates (it is impossible to overdose
on and far less addictive) and it can take the place of NSAIDs such as Advil
or Aleve, if people can’t take them due to problems with their kidneys or
ulcers or GERD.

In particular, marijuana appears to ease the pain of multiple sclerosis, and
nerve pain in general. This is an area where few other options exist, and
those that do, such as Neurontin, Lyrica, or opiates are highly sedating.
Patients claim that marijuana allows them to resume their previous activities
without feeling completely out of it and disengaged.

Along these lines, marijuana is said to be a fantastic muscle relaxant, and
people swear by its ability to lessen tremors in Parkinson’s disease. I have
also heard of its use quite successfully for fibromyalgia, endometriosis,
interstitial cystitis, and most other conditions where the final common
pathway is chronic pain.

Marijuana is also used to manage nausea and weight loss, and can be used to
treat glaucoma. A highly promising area of research is its use for PTSD in
veterans who are returning from combat zones. Many veterans and their
therapists report drastic improvement and clamor for more studies, and for a
loosening of governmental restrictions on its study. Medical marijuana is also
reported to help patients suffering from pain and wasting syndrome associated
with HIV, as well as irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn’s disease.

This is not intended to be an inclusive list, but rather to give a brief
survey of the types of conditions for which medical marijuana can provide
relief. As with all remedies, claims of effectiveness should be critically
evaluated and treated with caution.

### Talking with your doctor

Many patients find themselves in the situation of wanting to learn more about
medical marijuana, but feel embarrassed to bring this up with their doctor.
This is in part because the medical community has been, as a whole, overly
dismissive of this issue. Doctors are now playing catch-up, and trying to keep
ahead of their patients’ knowledge on this issue. Other patients are already
using medical marijuana, but don’t know how to tell their doctors about this
for fear of being chided or criticized.

My advice for patients is to be entirely open and honest with your physicians
and to have high expectations of them. Tell them that you consider this to be
part of your care and that you expect them to be educated about it, and to be
able to at least point you in the direction of the information you need.

My advice for doctors is that whether you are pro, neutral, or against medical
marijuana, patients are embracing it, and although we don’t have rigorous
studies and “gold standard” proof of the benefits and risks of medical
marijuana, we need to learn about it, be open-minded, and above all, be non-
judgmental. Otherwise, our patients will seek out other, less reliable sources
of information; they will continue to use it, they just won’t tell us, and
there will be that much less trust and strength in our doctor-patient
relationship. I often hear complaints from other doctors that there isn’t
adequate evidence to recommend medical marijuana, but there is even less
scientific evidence for sticking our heads in the sand.

Very interesting post, may be worth noting that there is no real need for the
THC element within the medical products, studies have shown that THC and CBD
combined at a 1:1 ratio is beneficial towards pain, however it has also been
discovered that THC can modify our brains functions, making it hard for some
people to continue with specific jobs.

Cbd Has been discovered to be effective for pain without the use of THC, this
is one of many reasons why it hit the world market with a storm, it allowed a
person to relieve themselfs (at a financial cost) from pain but without the
psychedelic side effects of the THC.

There is a big study happening in the UK at the moment, its still relatively
new but its full supported by a big company the CBD Medical and Health
Research is a very good read also, based on real human subjects.

The study linked above shows that THC is not needed for the effects that
people look for when using CBD, it is THC that is truly illegal in most places
around the world, and it is THC that is used to get a high, remove this
element and the drug is far less likely to be abused, CBD is also known for
helping with drug addictions and hold zero addictive properties.

Love this article and the best part is the author giving his peers advice to
keep an open mind and to educate themselves so they can talk with their
patients and assist them. Brian, I encourage you to keep an open mind. Your
response portrays a person bias towards cannabis. I encourage you to open your
mind and so your research. Check out The Sacred Plant Docuseries. Also would
you mind supplying links to back your comments on THC having no benefits as
well as any resource or scientific study that shows CBD can supply the same
benefits as THC. As a user and advocate of the Sacred Plant, I can share the
health benefits from my own personal use. My husband just got diagnosed with
Colon cancer when this blog was posted. We are eternally grateful to have
access to Cannabis and the knowledge in making his medicine. Thank God for
Rick Simpson and his oil discovery. I also look to history as our best and
wisest teacher. Do you khow long Cannabis has provided medical relief benefits
to millions of humans suffering. Finally, as a believer in God knowing He
created hemp and cannabis and made both for our benefit, I look forward to the
much needed studies that man prevented. Man made it bad and now that millions
are dying of disease man is rethinking his actions. Hemp with its CBDs is
amazing but so is Cannabis with its THC. THC does alter our thinking and for
the better. Did you know cannabis consumption causes neurogenesis in adults?
Did you know people have cured cancer ingesting Cannabis oil? Do you know all
the ailments cannabis treats? Do you have any friends who have benefited from
cannabis? Is the CBD oil explosion a health trend or fad? How many companies
will make billions selling fake CBD oil because of this fad or trend? Some
questions to ponder since the media controls the marketplace.

Doug Rice, President, Epilepsy Assn of Utah

The points regarding no need for THC are not entirely accurate. Our daughter
had great results using CBD oil to reduce epileptic seizures. But we saw total
control by adding small doses of THC.  
There are methods available to minimize the issue of impairment with cannabis.
THCa, the raw component in the plant, does not get a patient high. THC needs
to be decarboxylated (usually by applying heat over 180F) before it becomes
psychoactive. CBD also attenuates the effect of THC, so some of the
psychoactivity is subdued by having the combination of CBD and THC.

A new powerful report published by the American National Academies of Sciences
has examined the amount of research that has been published for years on the
use of cannabis for medical or recreational purposes, establishing for the
first time with a certain claritywhat are the positive and negative effects on
proven health.

i really enjoyed this article. I am 17 and have been using medical for about 2
years (not smoking, just oil and making smoothies with the sun leaves) and
refuse to take prescription medication from the hospital, it has helped a LOT
with my anxiety and depression, i cant even explain how much. it has also
helped with my joint pain and helps me sleep. Two years ago my grandmother was
diagnosed with a glioblastoma the size of a baseball, she started using the
oil and started juicing to help shrink the tumor. She started that and
completely changed her diet, last year around August the doctor couldn't find
the tumor anymore and it was great, she could finally talk and text and write
and remember things. Although this year as soon as she stopped, the cancer
came right back and she is in the hospital again now. Before this I had a pet
rat and didn't realize she could get stomach cancer from feeding her corn, i
put her on a different diet and constantly made cannabis salve and oil for
her. I ran out of it for a week at some point though and the cancer came back
within a day and had killed her 🙁  
This amazing plant has over 20,000 uses and i would Love to study it one day
more than i already do on my own. i hope people educate themselves on this
topic more and actually understand what it can do, because before it became
illegal we had used it for thousands of years. it really is an amazing plant.

Hi Dr. Grinspoon,

I am really confused about this study. I read lots of article which it says
Marijuana have bad effect on brain in long term and some article says
opposite. Doesn't it effect on lungs like when you smoke cigarette as well?
does it make you addicted?  
Could you introduce a reliable website I can read about Marijuana more?  
Thank you!

Hi Peter. My husband has been taking Xarelto AND Pletal (as prescribed by a
doctor despite pharmacists filling the prescriptions with a bit of shock and
stating they should not be taken together) since he had a DVT in his thigh.
This happened after knee surgery in Jan 2013, flying 13 hours in March 2013
totally unaware or warned by our doc that this was dangerous after surgery.
The DVT in the back of his thigh threw a large clot and put him in ICU on life
support in the Philippines, with a Pulmonary Embolism. He was inches from
death for approx 6 days and then 10 days induced coma total in ICU, 1 month in
hospital recovering (thankfully) learning to walk again etc. Since then he has
been on 10mg Xarelto (night dose) and 100mg Pletal (morning dose) and we have
been too terrified to reduce the dose in any way even though the docs in
Philippines said continue life long Xeralto and then wean off Pletal after 3
months, because the doc in Spain when we came back here said, leave it as it
is. Its now nearly 5 years later and he's still on both drugs. Approx 7 months
ago he and I started taking 3 micro doses of THC FECO per day, mainly as a
cancer preventative. Since then my husband and I have both lost weight. Ive
lost over 40lbs and still losing as I was obese and am still overweight but
its just naturally slowly coming off. (so unexpected, but good side effect) My
husband 6'2″ was never overweight, in fact he has always been fit and
muscular, and he has lost approx 20lbs which on his frame makes him look like
he's been locked up somewhere and starved, but it appears to be muscle mass,
its definitely muscle mass and despite working out and being a very fit active
man (68 yrs and fitter than most 30 somethings) his muscle loss is not
changing, he has managed to put on just 2lbs (also taking ISO Protein but no
idea if thats helping or not). We are wondering if it is the cannabis' blood
thinning capabilities, in addition to the thinning meds he is on that is
causing muscle loss and if as a result we could finally wean off some of the
chemical thinners if only by a percentage, or maybe remove one completely and
keep the other while maintaining the FCO which we plan to take in tiny
maintenance doses for the rest of our lives. We are in Spain and the docs here
seem to refuse to "decide" re the blood thinners, they almost cover their eyes
when we ask the question "philippine docs said to wean off Pletal.. you have
done new tests.. do we wean of Pletal? They will not respond! While its legal
here to use medical cannabis, the lack of knowledge by doctors here including
a Dutch doctor, make it difficult to consult on the interaction and the
possibility of what we desire, which is to cut down on his Xarelto and Pletal,
even if its just incremental, i.e. trimming 20% off each pill. We plan on
seeing our doc tomorrow for the first time since starting on the FECO for
blood tests to find out if his blood is now possibly "too thin" which in a way
would be good as it would be a sign we could reduce one or both of the
chemical blood thinners while maintaining the cannabis dose and then get him
tested monthly as he weans off under doc supervision. This is our hope, but we
are on our own as far as knowledge of the two sides i.e. cannabis/western
medicine, and we are aware that we will have to make a decision on our own
after the blood test results. If we find out his blood is "thin" then I
imagine the cod might suggest a dose reduction but he has been loath to change
anything in the past. It will be we who decide IF to wean, which drug to wean
off, or a bit of both, or all of one .. this is terrifying, but thats how it
is.  
So finally to my question  
Whats the question? I'm not sure??  
If his blood work comes back that all is ok re blood texture clotting etc,
then weaning off is bad? Why the muscle loss? Is there any data ANYWHERE that
suggests either Xarelto or Pletal affect muscle mass over the long term? (5
years) It would seem possible that over thin blood would affect muscles but
what do I know? He has also experienced some dizziness (light headed) this
last year which again, timing wise, ties into the addition of FECO to his diet
but Im not blaming the FECO, Im hoping the FECO is acting as a blood thinner
and that we can reduce the Chem meds which according to studies Ive read with
tears streaming down my face, have multiple side effects.  
Our desire, aim, hope, is to reduce the chemical meds, if not completely, then
proportionately wiht monthly testing to evaluate the blood "texture'  
Yes that question was both more than one and barely a question at the same
time. Since the incident in 2013 Ive suffered from PTSD and my sincerest wish
is to if not have closure on this, to after 5 years, adjust his medication and
see some sort of forward progress in that area. The idea of him taking this
the rest of his life when it may be unnecessary is horrific.  
We do not have access to a medical doctor who is also familiar with cannabis,
so Peter I ask of you with your background and your education and family
history with your grandfather, do you feel we are on the right track? Any
advice?  
My husband seems healthy but his muscle loss over the last 7 months is
dramatically visible and it frightens me (him too quietly but he doesnt say
much) and he is tired a lot but at the same time very active. This is an ex
rugby player, full of energy who moves and is busy all day. He should not be
losing muscle mass. No one can answer our questions or even nudge us in the
right direction.  
A nudge from you would be very much appreciated.  
Without info from professionals or the highly educated, we have almost decided
to take the self decision to trim a tiny bit off each of his two daily pills,
say 10% and then see where that goes, but how to know? When have we crossed a
line? He needs that muscle mass to take him through the rest of his life, his
muscle mass at the time of the incident in 2013 is what saved his life without
doubt.. he was strong and that & his fitness was in my opinion the reason he
lived when 7 bloody specialists told me daily to prepare for his imminent
death. Should the same thing happen today I know I would lose him. Maybe it
wont happen again, there was a knee surgery then a long international flight
and a synergy of events that lead to the incident in 2013, maybe we are
treating for something that just wont happen again but the two drugs he is
taking are in his system and maybe don't need to be. Any thought please xx

Hi Neva, Thank you for your comment. You situation is really complicated! I'm
not sure if there is any specific study which has been done that can answer
your questions. I would definitely consult with a Hematologist, ideally one
who is comfortable with cannabis therapeutics, so they can see this issue from
all sides. This might be hard to find but hopefully you can connect with one.

According to the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine,
"There is no evidence to support or refute a statistical association between
chronic effects of cannabis use and the risk of acute myocardial infarction."
I recommend that you read any literature that purports to show any such claims
very carefully because, as you alluded to in your question, this issue has
become very politicized. For example, some studies may imply cannabis causes
some or other ill consequence but, if you actually read the study carefully,
the cannabis and the ill consequence are just randomly associated, and have no
causal relationship to each other whatsoever, and may even be caused by the
same root causes. The science on both sides of this issue needs to improve,
and the federal government needs to lift restrictions on studying it's medical
utility.

Agree re Paranoia we need better education I spent years consuming high
strains of THC it definitely takes its toll on lots of people, however even a
strain that's high in THC seems be all good when mixed with a healthy dose of
CBD.

Hi Daniele, Just to offer my experience. I started taking Full Extract
Cannabis Oil 9 months ago (this has THC but the psychoactive effects can be
avoided by weaning on very slowly, very very very slowly with tiny tiny micro
doses) I hate the psychoactive effects.  
I am 58 and have been obese for about 10 years. I didn't take the Cannabis oil
for weight loss as I was completely unaware of that aspect, I am taking it as
an overall health aid and preventative and for balance in my endocannabinoid
system. 3 tiny doses per day every day, for the last 9 months  
I have lost over 40lbs during that time. Slowly gently but relentlessly
downwards. I was not even aware of the weight loss as I wasn't weighing
myself, Id given up after every diet on earth, good bad and fad. One day my
pants literally fell down, lucky I was at home 🙂 I realised Id lost weight, so
I weighed myself and at that time about 5 months in, Id lost 15lbs. I still
today cant believe it because i had genuinely given up, 58 years old and very
fat with sore knees and nothing I did (diligently might I add) changed a
thing, in fact everything I tried resulted in an increased weight after the
fact.  
Cannabis has made me lose a huge amount of weight and I am still consistently
gently heading downwards.  
Please note, I researched strains and studied for months and months before
taking the oil, I grew my own plants and made my own Full Extract Oil with a
clean solvent (ethanol) using the Rick Simpson method which is safest for home
makers, except for his solvents which are not clean, so I used his method with
rice cooker but I used my own choice of a clean solvent which is ethanol food
grade. If you are contemplating taking this oil you need to self educate, you
need to understand that the oil has THC in it and you need to wean on super
slowly to use it without the horrible psychoactive feelings that the THC bring
if you have not weaned on slowly, and you need to be patient once you start.
But it works, it did for me and I wasn't even trying. Might I suggest that you
start with a tincture as I did until I was no longer scared of it, tincture is
not as strong and is a good prelude to starting on the oil. You need to grow
your own so you know what you are taking.. buying from a recreational user
will not solve anything as they use all sorts of bad chemical nutrients and
you wont know the strain nor will the guy selling it to you. You need to
control what you are taking from beginning to end. I suggest an Indica, not
Sativa as the Sativas can have an anxiety effect, well it did with me while
the Indica strains are more relaxing, but the dose needs to start and remain
tiny, you are not trying to treat cancer, you are not increasing your dose,
you are just feeding your endocannabinoid receptors with a steady micro dose 3
times a day and your body will do the rest. Jorge Cervantes wrote a Medical
Cannabis book that will assist in you growing your own indoors or out,
everything from beginning to end. About 4 plants should do it, find a safe
place to grow them indoors under light or outdoors if you have a secluded
spot. Cervantes also gives recipes for tincture and other edibles, but
eventually you should progress to the oil using the rice cooker method EXACTLY
as Rick Simpson says but with a clean solvent. I have not yet stopped taking
BP medication but I've reduced my dose under doc guidance and Id guess about
15 more pounds and Ill be off them. My doc is unaware of my cannabis taken
orally but very impressed with my weight loss which he thinks is down to diet
and exercise. My knees don't ache any more.. so many things are coming back
that in my obesity Id forgotten id even lost out on. bending, tying shoes,
more energy, the list goes on. I accidentally lost weight by taking Full
Extract Cannabis Oil with THC and Im absolutely thrilled, while at the same
time waiting for something to go "ah gotcha", and the weight loss disappear,
but it hasn't and it wont because the cannabis has had an effect on my system
and restored a balance in some way I don't understand but appreciate beyond
measure. x  
You need to research and study and put in the effort to learn about this topic
and if you do you will be rewarded with an element of control and knowledge
about why, what to do & what not to do when it comes to consuming cannabis. PS
Smoking does not achieve anything, we are talking tincture or full extract oil
taken orally xx

How can the top Universities and colleges in the United States teach about the
therapeutic, medicinal benefits of cannabis if it’s classified as schedule 1?
The US government is adamant that there are none. If you, Harvard, are saying
that there are benefits, how is it legal to keep the classification the same?  
What is going on here?

"Harvard" has many different faculty members who likely hold many different
views on medical marijuana; this blog doesn't attempt or purport to speak for
all of them. That said, you are correct that there is a dichotomy between the
the government's classification of marijuana as having "no medical benefit"
and this article which cites about a dozen areas where marijuana has been
demonstrated to be beneficial. Unfortunately, our government's policy is
vastly out of step with the reality that millions of patients are
experiencing, and with modern scientific evidence. It needs to change. (The
history of our nation's "War on Marijuana" is fascinating to read about; it is
mostly based on racism as well as politics against the anti-Vietnam left…long
story!).

I am 46 and have suffered from migraines for nearly 25 years. They have become
less frequent ( a few per month instead of a few per week), but harder to
control with rescue medications such as relpax. For 2 months in a row now I
have had to take a steroid to get rid of the headache which had lasted for
more than 5 days. I have tried several preventative medications over the years
(lyrica, topomax, Elavil, botox, Effexor, occipital nerve block injections
etc), with fleeting success. I also suffer from chronic neck tension and pain
resulting from disc bulges caused by a previous accident which exacerbates the
headaches.

I live in Florida and have been told that I automatically qualify for a
medical marijuana card as I am a breast cancer survivor (3 years in
remission). However, I am worried about the stigma and potential
political/social complications of a marijuana prescription. I work full-time,
have 2 small children, and am pursuing my MBA. I need to be fully functioning.
Period. I am MOST concerned about any contraindications that it might have on
Tamoxifen that I have been prescribed to take for 7 more years. Not sure that
I can handle the anxiety of wondering, what if…

Any suggestions that you have or research that you can share would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks so much.

Glad that you found relief from your symptoms. Certainly, you are not alone,
which is why doctors and patients need to become better educated on this
topic, and more research needs to be done!

There are many different ways to consume medical marijuana: drops under the
tongue, edibles, tinctures, vaporizing it, topical treatments; it is not
recommended (at least by doctors…) that people smoke it (though,
interestingly, it hasn't been linked to lung cancer in the studies I've seen).

Actually, several studies have compared the lungs of a marijuana smoker to
those of a tobacco user, and the marijuana smokers have had a much higher lung
capacity. Some studies have also showed that repetitive marijuana use can
eventually slow the effects of tobacco. It still has not proven "medically
beneficial", and more studies need to occur before any judgement can be made.
THC in marijuana has been proven to bind to the brain cells that relate to,
and control excitability and relaxation.

OK lets begin by removing a couple of things, the medical/recreational and
more importantly get rid of the marijuana prohibition term, use the plants
correct name and then perhaps patients might not be so confused, its name is
Cannabis.

All Cannabis should be grown organically, never have the males removed and the
object is to gain as many of the 140 cannabinoids as possible to bring about
whole health.

How the oils and tinctures are made are very important and given the USA is
getting it completely wrong and are now years behind what we in the Cannabis
compassion suppliers are finding and now know.

The research is being done, it is simply not being done by big pharma or
governments.

There is absolutely no health or safety risk using Cannabis from conception to
the grave. Anyone and everyone should be able to grow the plant and use it as
they please as you should any other herb or vegetable, it should not be on a
drugs list and it should not be under the control of drug companies or the
medical profession.

Time to end the war on a plant and heal the planet.

My father is Dr. Lester Grinspoon, the "grandfather" of medical marijuana
(a.k.a. cannabis), who has been fighting to legalize this ever since his book
'Marihuana Reconsidered' [sic] came out in 1971, so I'm not unsympathetic to
your position. 🙂

If THC is removed, is there pain relief? In other words -- is there pain
relief and PTSD help etc. etc when the THC chemical that makes people high
removed from medical marihuana ?

There are many compounds in marijuana so THC isn't everything but, that said,
I believe that it is a fairly important component in pain control. CBD,
another cannabinoid, does have pain controlling effects as well, without the
psychoactive effects.

"We can only hope that within the next decade the effects of the “war on
drugs” will start to fade and give way to a more comprehensive and fact-based
understanding of all bioactive substances. So whether you reach for the
medicine bottle or the lighter, you’ll understand just how each dose will
affect you, the benefits and risks of consumption, and the potential for
abuse—and, however you choose to use these substances, you’ll have greater
assistance from our health care system and a more open-minded society to

Hi Peter,

It is a very emotive subject. As I see as Governments etc can make money from
medical marijuana then they will take it on board. It is a nonsense that the
large pharma countries are legally killing people and it is only recently that
many of us are waking up to natural medicine. Take the large alcohol
manufacturers, lover the world over by Governments and their paymasters as it
generates so much revenue for them. This is despite the devastation that this
drug causes to some many families the world over.

Hi Peter!  
Tell me please, is there any statistics on how the number of traffic accidents
has changed after some states of the USA have allowed the use of marijuana? It
would be interesting to know statistics on cars and motorcycles. We stay in

People shouldn't drive when they have used ANY medicine or substance with
psychoactive effects including cannabis. This study from NIH (National
Institute of Health) shows impairment but not as dangerous as alcohol (which
is a good summary of marijuana in general…)

There are studies on this exact topic! This is a recent article looking at two
studies. I find more weight in the study conducted by AJPH, in part because it
is more extensive. Of course driving impaired is not to be condoned and this
is a topic worth researching.

Information on drugs interaction are rare. Do you know the intersections with
new oral anticoagulants such as Apixaban? One of my patient with ALS got a
recurrent pulmonary embolism on treatment with apixaban and oil cannabis.

This needs to be studied and is exactly why the government needs to take
marijuana off of "schedule one" so that it can be studied. Given how new the
oral anticoagulants are, I don't think it's been studied yet. The case you
cite could just be treatment failure and have nothing to do with the cannabis…

But it wasn't clear to me how it would have anticoagulant properties as an
oil, I neglected to add above. (Two anticoagulants would cancel each other
out, so to speak?)

It will be more helpful when the bulk of our research on this issue isn't
coming just from other countries, or private labs here in the US.

Cannabis oil extraction is advancing quite dramatically as well. The
cannabinoids and terpenes can be extracted in a number of ways including
ethanol/hydrocarbon soak, distillation, even a press (similar to a t-shirt
press) using heat and pressure to literally squeeze the oils out of the cured
flowers. The healing properties of these oils can even be recombined to
specifically treat different types of ailments. What is needed, is more
information to identify which compound from the plant that is aiding their
specific ailment. Even if someone has not had a beneficial experience with one
of the strains they have chosen to use, there is a myriad of other strains
with different ratios/percentages of terpenes/cannabinoids. Genetic profiles
of strains are even being mapped to aid researchers in identifying which may
best be helpful to patients in the future.

You're very welcome. There is a small but very dedicated community out to
gather hard data and empirical evidence on the matter to go along with the
patient's accounts. Of course, it is expanding every day because of articles
like this and doctors like you, but I digress. There are legitimate benefits
to cannabis which can improve the quality in many aspects of life and it is
just unfortunate that progress for people's health and well-being has to be
sacrificed amongst the geopolitical scene to line already wealthy wallets
and/or egos of already powerful people. The archaic views putting marijuana in
the Schedule 1 rating along with heroin, methamphetamines, etc. need to be
changed first and foremost because it truly is ludicrous to insinuate that
cannabis has no medical benefits.

To Alfonso and others interested,  
What about Rick Simpson Oil ( R.S.O. ) ?  
I reference the life experience of Canadian entertainer Alan Park  
( Royal Canadian Air Farce sketch comedy ensemble, popular national Canadian
comedy television show ).  
He used RSO in a suppository form and purportedly reduced his  
psa blood test from around 700 to close to zero, over maybe a five  
month period !  
He was diagnosed at stage four prostate cancer after going to the  
Doctor for an unrelated complaint, and subsequent diagnostic tests  
revealed his totally unsuspected, and late stage, prostate cancer.  
He apparently could not be offered any conventional treatment  
per the assessment of his Physician due to the advanced stage  
of his prostate cancer condition.  
The Doctor gave him about three months to live. He has celebrated  
three years of survival since that initial cancer diagnosis.  
Rick Simpson is a Canadian citizen that apparently has been under  
legal duress associated with his total marijuana plant conversion  
to oil concentrate of some sort. Alan Park uses the RSO in suppository  
form.  
Alan Park has an online pod cast called, GREEN CRUSH, which  
is related to marijuana issues, medical marijuana, and his  
personal experiences.  
If his health story journey is accurate, and positively in support of prostate
cancer  
treatment in a genuinely efficacious and measurably evidenced  
based way, we should get our interest directed in this area  
of inquiry, most ricky ticky !  
It certainly sounds compelling to me, at least on the face of his  
narrative of his very unconventional personal experience and  
testimony.

SAM Action

Doctors are the leading cause of Opioid addiction in America. They continue to
prescribe Oxycontin like it was candy and then after the prescription runs
out, their patients turn to the only available alternative; Afghanistan grown
US Military protected Heroin. The greatest threat to American youth is the
ignorance and arrogance of the AMA and a Federal Government that refuses to
consider Marijuana as an adjuvant for pain mitigation.

Shame on us for tolerating a corrupt alcohol-based establishment and
perpetuating the 1937 Nazi-era marijuana prohibition laws.

I agree fortunately I never took opiates until I was legally prescribed them
in 2004 after a MRI and my diagnosis for back pain and in my town we don't
have heroin and yes I was on oxycontin years ago and when I had to detox off
of them due to unfortunate circumstances I thought I was dying I never want to
experience that again

I’ve been using DC medical marijuana for four years now, to treat my
fibromyalgia, other health issues, and even my addiction recovery. Marijuana
is non-toxic and safe to use every day, and I’m having great success with it.
So are millions of others of people. Pills kill, cannabis heals. I’ve been
smoking cannabis for four decades, I don’t need no scientist or Dr. to tell me
the magic that it contains. They need to convince and educate themselves. They
need to remember the Hippocratic oath to first do no harm, and death pills are
killing people every 15 minutes in America. Stop with the pills already !!!!!!

Thank you, Sir Your Blog is very nice and valuable for everyone who doesn't
know about Marijuana and it benefits which are related to health. Here you
describe Marijuana legalization, use regarding health and Pain control but
they should take it after getting a recommendation from MMJ doctor, Which is
very necessary.  
Online Medical Card also Providing Services for having Marijuana legally after
Recommend by the doctor.
