The Cretaceous Period is the most recent period of the Mesozoic Era, spanning
77 million years, from 142 million to 65 million years ago. In 1822, Omalius
d'Halloy termed the chalky rocks (Latin: "creta") found on the English and
French sides of the English Channel "Cretaceous." The name is now applied to
all materials deposited above Jurassic Period rocks but below Tertiary Period
rocks. During the Cretaceous more land was submerged than at any time since
the Ordovician Period. Tectonic plates moved apart, causing major mountain
building, and continents began to resemble those existing today.

The Cretaceous System is subdivided into the following stages from youngest to
oldest: Upper Cretaceous includes Maastrichtian, Campanian, Santonian,
Coniacian, Turonian, and Cenomanian; Lower Cretaceous includes Albian, Aptian,
Barremian, Hauterivian, Valanginian, and Berriasian. These names, based on
type localities where rocks at a given stratigraphic level were first studied,
are widely used to refer to rock units or chronological times.

**Rock Locations**  
Cretaceous rocks make up nearly 29% of the total area of Phanerozoic deposits
on the Earth 's landmasses. Because of the great extent of their outcrop area
and presence in drill cores, Cretaceous rocks are the most intensively studied
part of the Phanerozoic rock column.

At one time Cretaceous seas covered 50% of the present North American
continent. Thick Cretaceous sedimentary deposits form a narrow belt of
outcrops from British Columbia to Central America. They extend throughout the
Rocky Mountains and western Plains states, around the north edge of the
Mississippi embayment, and along the southern and eastern sides of the
Appalachian Mountains. Volcanoes in the western United States spread layers of
volcanic ash, now turned into bentonite, in the center of the continent.
Cretaceous rocks crop out on several Caribbean islands. This group extends
along the Andes Mountain belt from Colombia to Cape Horn, and onto Antarctica.
Cretaceous outcrops cover parts of central and southeastern South America. A
vast volcanic province in the ParanÃ¡ River basin of Uruguay and Brazil is
mirrored across the Atlantic Ocean in the Etendeka province of western Africa,
regions that were joined before South America and Africa separated.

In Europe, Cretaceous chalk also crops out around the Paris basin. Other
deposits are in Denmark, north and central Germany, central and southern
France, the Pyrenees Mountains, the Alps, Italy, Slovenia, coastal Croatia,
Bosnia and Hercegovina, and Yugoslavia. Russia and the southwestern Asian
republics have Cretaceous rocks. There are Cretaceous rocks in west Africa and
Mozambique. India's Cretaceous deposits include the Deccan traps, a large,
thick sequence of volcanic rocks east of Bombay. Cretaceous rocks crop out in
Thailand, Borneo, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

**Events**  
In eastern North America the continental border gradually sank, shifting the
shoreline inland. Shallow seas spread over the interiors of North America,
western Europe, eastern Europe, western Russia, and the northern Arctic. They
occupied central Australia and eastern Africa, eventually covering one-third
of the present-day landmasses. Tectonic plates moved apart after the breakup
of Pangaea in the middle Mesozoic. Previously, the drift of Africa relative to
Europe had created the Tethys Sea, an ancestral Mediterranean Sea, with many
island arcs, basins, and microcontinental fragments. It reached its maximum
width in early Cretaceous time. Movements of Africa, Europe, and the small
Adriatic tectonic plate caused subduction that consumed Tethys, while seafloor
spreading led to widening of the North Atlantic Ocean.

Europe remained connected to North America until 81 million years ago;
Greenland separated from Europe 70 million years ago. As the Adriatic plate
carrying Italy closed Tethys and collided with Austria and Switzerland, the
Alps rose. The Alpine region also marked a subduction zone. The Mediterranean
began to open to the south. Mountain building also took place for the Dinaric
and Hellenic Alps during collisions of the Carpathian-Serbo-Macedonian and
Apulian arcs, in Saudi Arabia and Oman, and in the Himalayas.

Seafloor spreading in the Atlantic led to westward movement of the North
American plate. Compression around the Pacific Ocean margin started the
Cordilleran and Laramide orogenies and began the creation of the present-day
Rockies, Sierra Nevada, California Coast Ranges, and Andes, mountain belts
that extend the length of North and South America. Enormous amounts of granite
formed within the crust as subduction carried continental sediments deep
within the crust around the Pacific margin and between Africa and Europe and
melted. This led to volcanism in many subduction zones. Mountain building also
affected Japan and the Philippines.

**Life**  
Marine invertebrates included many modern-looking pelecypods and gastropods.
Widespread ammonite fossils have helped define Cretaceous stratigraphy. The
shells, or tests, of abundant foraminifera created the chalk deposits that
gave the period its name. Extensive coral reefs grew in the equatorial belt.
Dinosaurs ruled the land, with sauropods, tyrannosaurs, duck-billed and horned
dinosaurs prominent. Pterosaurs and toothed birds flew in the skies, and
mosasaurs appeared in the seas. Primitive mammals included insectivorous
marsupials. Deciduous trees and other angiosperms created modern-looking
forests by the middle of the Cretaceous Period.

**The End of the Cretaceous**  
A great extinction marked the end of the Cretaceous Period. The dinosaurs,
ammonites, and many marine creatures abruptly disappeared. High concentrations
of iridium and textural features of the boundary clay layer separating
Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks support the idea of a meteorite impact producing
a worldwide layer of debris at essentially the same moment at the very end of
the Cretaceous Period. The huge Chicxulub Crater off the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula of
Mexico is the likely point of impact. Some researchers favor a volcanic
catastrophe or other series of events and a more gradual extinction of species
and genera, but the impact theory has gained wide acceptance.
