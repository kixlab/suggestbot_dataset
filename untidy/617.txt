NOAAâ€™s Science Advisory Board (SAB) was established by a Decision Memorandum
dated September 25, 1997. It is the only Federal Advisory Committee with
responsibility to advise the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and
Atmosphere on long- and short-range strategies for research, education and the
application of science to resource management and environmental assessment and
prediction.

SAB activities and advice provide necessary input to ensure that National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) science programs are of the
highest quality and provide optimal support to resource management, and
environmental assessment and prediction. The advisory board assists NOAA in
maintaining a complete and accurate understanding of scientific issues
critical to the agency's missions.

Composed of eminent scientists, engineers, resource managers and educators,
the diverse membership of the Board assures expertise reflecting the full
breadth of NOAA's responsibilities, as well as the ethnic and gender diversity
of the United States. Members are appointed by the Under Secretary of Commerce
for Oceans and Atmosphere and NOAA Administrator.
