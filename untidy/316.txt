# The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime

## John Donohue, Steven Levitt

**NBER Working Paper No. 8004**  
**Issued in November 2000**  
**NBER Program(s):Children, Law and Economics, Public Economics**

We offer evidence that legalized abortion has contributed significantly to
recent crime reductions. Crime began to fall roughly 18 years after abortion
legalization. The 5 states that allowed abortion in 1970 experienced declines
earlier than the rest of the nation, which legalized in 1973 with Roe v. Wade.
States with high abortion rates in the 1970s and 1980s experienced greater
crime reductions in the 1990s. In high abortion states, only arrests of those
born after abortion legalization fall relative to low abortion states.
Legalized abortion appears to account for as much as 50 percent of the recent
drop in crime.
