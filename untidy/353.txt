The United States of America imported US$2.614 trillion worth of goods from
around the globe in 2018. That dollar amount reflects an 8.4% gain since 2014
and an 8.5% uptick from 2017 to 2018.

From a continental perspective, 45.4% of America’s total imports by value in
2018 were purchased from providers in Asia. Fellow North American trade
partners supplied 25.8% of import sales to the U.S. while 21.9% worth
originated from Europe. At 4.9%, suppliers from Latin America excluding Mexico
but including the Caribbean accounted for a smaller percentage of American
import purchase, with an even tinier 1.4% coming from Africa and 0.6% from
Oceania led by Australia.

Given America’s population of 329.3 million people, its total $2.614 trillion
in 2018 imports translates to roughly $7,900 in yearly product demand from
each U.S. resident.

# United States Top 10 Imports

## Top 10

The following product groups represent the highest dollar value in America's
import purchases during 2018. Also shown is the percentage share each product
category represents in terms of overall imports into the US.

                
                                      1. Machinery including computers: US$386.4 billion (14.8% of total imports)
                      2. Electrical machinery, equipment: $367.1 billion (14%)
                      3. Vehicles: $306.7 billion (11.7%)
                      4. Mineral fuels including oil: $241.4 billion (9.2%)
                      5. Pharmaceuticals: $116.3 billion (4.5%)
                      6. Optical, technical, medical apparatus: $93.4 billion (3.6%)
                      7. Furniture, bedding, lighting, signs, prefab buildings: $72.1 billion (2.8%)
                      8. Plastics, plastic articles: $61.9 billion (2.4%)
                      9. Gems, precious metals: $60.8 billion (2.3%)
                      10. Organic chemicals: $54.6 billion (2.1%)
                

America's imports of pharmaceuticals had the fastest-growing increase in value
among the top 10 import categories, up 20.5% from 2017 to 2018.

In second place for expanding import purchases was machinery including
computers via an 18.6% uptick.

US imports of mineral fuels-related goods delivered the third-fastest
improvement thanks to its 18.3% gain, propelled by America’s higher purchases
of crude and refined petroleum oils.

Note that the results listed above are at the categorized two-digit Harmonized
Tariff System (HTS) code level. For a more detailed view of imported goods at
the four-digit HTS code level, see the section _Searchable List of America’s
