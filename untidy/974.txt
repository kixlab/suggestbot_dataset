# Marijuana Smoking Doesn't Kill

Illegal Herb Not Harmless, but Data Show No Link to Death

By Daniel J. DeNoon

From the WebMD Archives

Sept. 18, 2003 -- Marijuana smoking isn't harmless, but at least it won't kill
you.

It's been feared that marijuana smoke, like tobacco smoke, causes cancer and
heart disease. The evidence argues otherwise, writes Stephen Sidney, MD,
associate director for research for Kaiser Permanente, Oakland, Calif., in the
Sept 20 issue of _The British Medical Journal_.

"Although the use of [marijuana] is not harmless, the current knowledge base
does not support the assertion that it has any notable adverse public health
impact in relation to mortality," Sidney concludes.

## No Marijuana Deaths in 2 Large Studies

Sidney points to two large studies. The first is from (where else?)
California. A large HMO looked at 65,177 men and women age 15-49. Over 10
years, marijuana users died no sooner than nonusers.

The second study looked at 45,450 Swedish army conscripts. They were 18-20
years old when asked about marijuana use. Fifteen years later, the marijuana
users were just as likely to remain alive as nonusers.

And since marijuana smoking can't kill outright -- there's no such thing as a
fatal marijuana overdose -- short-term use isn't deadly. Long-term use can't
be good for you. But Sidney notes that most marijuana smokers don't become
long-term users.

One worry about marijuana smoke is that it is inhaled, and held, deep in the
lungs. But the typical user smokes only one marijuana cigarette -- or less --
a day. Tobacco users often smoke 20 or more cigarettes daily. Moreover,
tobacco contains nicotine, a highly addictive substance. Marijuana, Sidney
concludes, is less likely to harm than tobacco.

A 2001 study suggested that marijuana smoking increases the risk of heart
attack in the hour immediately after smoking. But this seems to be the case in
no more than one-fifth of 1% of heart attacks -- a very rare risk indeed.

## More Marijuana Deaths in the Future?

Marijuana users shouldn't cancel their life insurance policies just yet.
Sidney warns that longer-term data may indeed show that marijuana smoking
eventually raises the risk of premature death.

And if marijuana is legalized, long-term use may become more common. If this
is the case, there certainly will be more long-term effects of marijuana use.

635-636.
