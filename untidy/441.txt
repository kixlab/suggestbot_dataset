#### **Who are the natives of Antarctica?**

![Adelie penguin](../../gallery/penguins/two-adelies1.jpg) __  
Native Antarcticans

* * *

**Antarctica does not and has never had an indigenous population** (there are
no native human Antarcticans).

The continent was once a part of a larger land mass called Gondwana that
settled over the south pole and split from Australasia and South America long
before humans evolved. There haven't been any land bridges to Antarctica for
around 35 million years, it has been an isolated island for all this time.

Humans are thought to have evolved in East Africa very recently in geological
terms (no more than 5 million years at most). We then left the ancestral
homeland and moved across all of the continents of the world.

Antarctica was already too isolated by distance, climate and the storminess of
its seas for primitive peoples to discover. It wasn't until 1820 when human
technology and navigation was sophisticated enough to allow anyone to sail far
enough south to even see Antarctica for the first time. There are a number of
poorly substantiated claims of setting foot upon the Antarctic mainland from
1820, though 1899 is the first date accepted by some historians as
undisputable. When the first people did set foot on Antarctica there wasn't
anyone already there.

**Antarctica is therefore one of the few places in the world that can truly be
described as having been discovered** , rather than there being people already
living there who had known about it for hundreds or thousands of years before
its "discovery".

#### **Who lives in Antarctica today? How many people live there?**

![Antarctica and the Southern Ocean](../../Bases/McMurdo/PA260131-sm.jpg) __  
McMurdo Base  
- the closest Antarctica gets to having a town 

* * *

**The people who travel to or live in Antarctica fall into two main groups,
those who live and work on scientific research stations or bases, and
tourists.**

No-one lives in Antarctica indefinitely in the way that they do in the rest of
the world. It has no commercial industries, no towns or cities, no permanent
residents.

The only "settlements" with longer term residents (who stay for some months or
a year, maybe two) are scientific bases. These vary in size, but typically
have 50 people there in the summer and 15-20 in the winter (Antarctica is
never really talked about as having spring or autumn/fall), summer lasts from
October/November to March/April, the rest of the year is considered to be
winter.

**There are around 66 scientific bases in Antarctica, of which about 37 are
occupied year round, the remainder are open during the summer and closed down
for winter. There are about 4,000 people through the summer months and about
1,000 overwinter each year.**

Most residents of scientific stations do a "summer only" this is anywhere from
3-6 months, with a smaller number staying over the Antarctic winter (when any
chance of transport in or out is virtually impossible). A typical tour is one
summer or one winter and the two summers either side, around 15 months in
total (this time is continuous with no visits home or elsewhere in the
meantime). It used to be quite common for some to stay for two winters and
three summers, though this is rare now.

Some people have had an "enforced" winter, this is when ice conditions mean
the ship that should have come to get them couldn't get through and had to go
home without them until the following year. The result is a wait of another 6
months or more until a ship can get through again. This can mean three summers
and three winters in a row or at least an extra Antarctic winter season that
was not anticipated. Such events however were thankfully rare and did little
for the mental state of the people involved, making fitting back into the
world back home again more problematic.

The US base at McMurdo Sound has up to 1,000 personnel at the peak time, this
is the nearest there is to a town. With such a rapid turn-over of people,
Antarctic bases are more like oil-rigs or military bases than towns.

#### **Tourists**

![](/Travel/522_Cuverville_Island_John_031-sm.jpg) __The figures for the
2016-17 season show that there were 44,202 visitors. A little down on the
figure of 47,225 in the peak season so far in 2007-08, though rising again
after falling to 26,509 in 2011-12. The drop was due to the fact that large
ships are no longer allowed to visit Antarctica due to fuel spillage dangers.

**In terms of numbers, tourists greatly outnumber national programme
personnel, though the personnel on scientific bases clock up more man-days.**
While tourists may only only spend a relatively small time ashore on landings
(for the most part staying on their cruise ships), it is by its nature
relatively "high-impact" time at the most picturesque and easily accessible
areas, compare this to a scientist or support worker who spend most of their
time working on a permanent or semi-permanent base.

#### **So can I go and live in Antarctica then?**

**![Antarctica and the Southern Ocean](camp1-sm.jpg) __Not in the way that is
usually meant by this.** You can 't move to Antarctica, find somewhere to live
and then find a job, meet someone, get married, buy a house, have kids, send
them to school, start your own business, become a member of the local golf
club and become mayor. **

You can get a job in Antarctica as a scientist or in scientific support, but
it has to be in advance before you go there. **If you really want to and you
have the required skills and you keep at it in case you don 't get accepted
first time (many people have to try more than once) then you can go and spend
some time in Antarctica having an experience of your life. I recommend it, I
did it for two winters and three summers and have been telling people about it
ever since.**

Access to Antarctica is restricted by the Antarctic Treaty. If you want to
organize your own trip or expedition there, you will have to request
permission from the government of your own country.** You will have to show
that you will be completely self sufficient and have a very good reason for
wanting to go which will have little or no environmental impact, you will have
to show exactly how you will do this. If you can 't do these things, you will
be denied permission and will be breaking the law (of your own country) if you
just go anyway, you will also be breaking the law if you stay longer than you
said you would or otherwise do anything against the Antarctic Treaty.

#### **"Sort of" Towns**

![](villa2_big.jpg) __There are two places in Antarctica that are sometimes
regarded as civilian "towns". The first is the Chilean **Villa Las Estrellas**
base (just over 100 residents in the summer, around 80 in the winter) on King
George Island, part of the South Shetlands group, off the western tip of the
Antarctic Peninsula. The second is the Argentinian **Esperanza** base (55
winter residents) in Hope Bay at the very tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. They
both have facilities such as a school, medical facilities, gym etc. though are
more accurately regarded as associations of the military and scientific
operations.

Another view is that they are both attempts by the respective country's
governments to make claims of settlement of Antarctica as an insurance for the
future should the terms of the Antarctic Treaty come up for significant
renegotiation.

Women in the later stages of pregnancy were sent to such places in the late
1970's and 1980's to give birth to "native Antarcticans" to support such
claims.

**In recent years, the Chilean Villa Las Estrellas has become the site of
tourist activity for "fly/sail" trips to Antarctica.** Only a few years ago,
the only way for tourists to reach Antarctica was by ship, now it is possible
to fly to Antarctica across the Drake Passage so saving a couple of days
sailing in each direction and potentially a lot of sea-sick time to join a
cruise ship for the rest of the journey at King George Island. Though to my
mind the traditional approach by ship which is then avoided is one of the most
magical aspects of going to Antarctica. There are snowmobile and ski trips
available from the "town" and of course the local wildlife as an attraction,
these are served by a small 20 place hostel.
