![](../../images/spacer.gif)  
![](../../images/spacer.gif)  
| **1. How long does evolution take?** |  
![](../../images/spacer.gif)  
| Even though evolution is taking place all around us, for many species the
process operates so slowly that it is not observable except over thousands or
hundreds of thousands of years -- much too long to witness in a human
lifetime. There are cases in quickly reproducing life forms like bacteria and
fruit flies, however, where evolution can be seen happening in a matter of
weeks for the bacteria and many months for the flies. In these cases the
relatively large number of generations in a given period of time is key, since
evolutionary change occurs incrementally from one generation to the next. All
else being equal, the more generations you have, the more quickly evolution
happens.

| **2. Can you observe evolution happening?** |  
![](../../images/spacer.gif)  
| Because for many species, humans included, evolution happens over the course
of many thousands of years, it is rare to observe the process in a human
lifetime. Usually only laboratory scientists studying quickly reproducing life
forms, like single-celled creatures and some invertebrates, have the
opportunity to see evolutionary change happen before their eyes. All of us can
and do experience the indirect effects of evolution nearly every day, however.
One of the more important evolutionary concerns facing humans today is the
emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes. A battle against bacteria that we
have been winning with medicine for the last 50 years or so is now an even
race, according to some scientists -- because of the rapid rate of bacterial
evolution. Similarly, the use of pesticides in agriculture has driven the
evolution of resistant insects that require more or harsher chemicals to be
killed. Scientists studying Galapagos finches have seen evolutionary changes
in beak size and shape in just a few years. Major evolutionary transformations
take much, much longer.

| **3. How old is Earth?** |  
![](../../images/spacer.gif)  
| Earth is approximately 4.55 billion years old. Radiometric dating, a method
that measures the level of radioactive decay in rocks to determine how old
they are has consistently aged moon rocks and meteorites at 4.4 to 4.6 billion
years old. Ages of these types of rocks provide the most accurate estimates of
the age of Earth and the rest of the solar system because they have not been
subjected to the same forces that recycle Earth's crust. As new land forms
along cracks between the planet's continental plates, old rocks are destroyed.
Thus, the oldest rocks on Earth may not exist anymore. The oldest dated
minerals, at 4.0 to 4.2 billion years old, are tiny zircon crystals found in
sedimentary rocks in western Australia.

| **4. How long has life existed on Earth?** |  
![](../../images/spacer.gif)  
| The oldest known fossils are approximately 3.5 billion years old, but some
scientists have discovered chemical evidence suggesting that life may have
begun even earlier, nearly 4 billion years ago.

| **5. How long ago did dinosaurs exist?** |  
![](../../images/spacer.gif)  
| Dinosaurs existed between 230 million years ago and 65 million years ago,
but none of the known dinosaur species existed for this entire time period.
Throughout the group's existence, individual dinosaur species were evolving
and going extinct. Some species diverged and gave rise to other species, while
others disappeared. A mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous
period,  
65 million years ago, ended the reign of dinosaurs on Earth. Recently, many
scientists have come to the conclusion that, while dinosaurs may have
disappeared, one dinosaur lineage had evolved into birds long before the
extinction event that wiped out the other dinosaurs -- and so, in a sense,
dinosaurs are still around today.

| **6. How long ago did humans become human?** |  
![](../../images/spacer.gif)  
| The oldest known hominid, or humanlike species, has been dated at 4.4
million years old. Another species, which is yet to be confirmed as a hominid,
has been dated at 6 million years old. Scientists estimate that the hominid
lineage diverged from the ape lineage 5 to 8 million years ago. _Homo sapiens_
, the species to which we belong, has existed for about 100,000 years.
