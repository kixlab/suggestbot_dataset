>> The end of fossil fuels

>>

>> # When will fossil fuels run out?

>>

>> Fossil fuels are hundreds of millions of years old, but in the last 200
years consumption has increased rapidly, leaving fossil fuel reserves depleted
and climate change seriously impacted. Reserves are becoming harder to locate,
and resources won't last forever - here's when fossil fuels could run out.

>>

>> ## What are fossil fuels?

>>

>> Fossil fuels are biological materials containing hydrocarbon, which can be
burned and used as a source of energy. They're found in the Earth's crust, so
we have to drill into the earth to extract them.

>>

>> Fossil fuels developed billions of years ago, when dead organic matter
became buried at the bottom of the sea and altered as a result of **anaerobic
digestion**. Oil deposits in the North Sea are around 150 million years old,
while much of Britain 's coal began to form over 300 million years ago.

>>

>> While we probably used fossil fuels as far back as the Iron Age, it wasn't
until the Industrial Revolution that wide-scale extraction started. It
completely transformed the way humanity lived and worked, allowing us to power
our homes, businesses and machines with coal, oil and gas.

>>

>> ## Why are fossil fuels bad?

>>

>> We only have a finite supply of fossil fuels. The amount we use now simply
isn't sustainable, and the problem is getting worse as the global population
increases. The limited resources in the ground aren't even the biggest problem
- there are plenty of downsides to plundering the earth for coal, gas and oil:

>>  
>>                 >>                       *  **Carbon emissions.** Global
carbon emissions from fossil fuels

>>  
>>

>> accounts for 90% of all emissions from human activity. And while UK carbon
emissions are dropping, global fossil fuel emissions are increasing and global
temperatures are rising.

>>  
>>                 >>                       *  **Air pollution.** The burning
of fossil fuels releases carbon

>>  
>>

>> dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which pollutes the
air we breathe. Air pollution in cities has been linked to an increase in
respiratory diseases, like asthma, particularly in young children and the
elderly, along with shortened life expectancy.

>>  
>>                 >>                       *  **Ocean pollution.** Carbon
dioxide dissolves into the sea,

>>  
>>

>> causing acidification which affects the life cycles of marine organisms.
Our oceans absorb heat created from fossil fuel emissions, causing
temperatures to rise and coral reefs to bleach and die.

>>  
>>                 >>                       *  **Habitat destruction.** Vast
amounts of land are decimated to

>>  
>>

>> provide space for drilling wells, pipelines, and processing facilities used
in oil and gas drilling operations. Habitat disruption and noise from drilling
are some of the biggest threats to wildlife populations across the globe.

>>  
>>                 >>                       *  **Transporting fossil fuels.**
Aside from the carbon emissions

>>  
>>

>> caused by burning fossil fuels, there's a huge environmental cost to
transporting them. Diesel fumes from transportation add to CO2 emissions, oil
spills threaten marine life, and flammable natural gas leaks have led to
hundreds of human casualties in recent years.

>>

>> Fossil fuels, as the name suggests, are very old. North Sea oil deposits
are around 150 million years old, whilst much of Britain's coal began to form
over 300 million years ago. Although humans probably used fossil fuels in
ancient times, as far back as the Iron Age, it was the Industrial Revolution
that led to their wide-scale extraction.

>>

>> And in the very short period of time since then - just over 200 years -
we've consumed an incredible amount of them, leaving fossil fuels all but gone
and the climate seriously impacted.

>>

>> Fossil fuels are an incredibly dense form of energy, and they took millions
of years to become so. And when they're gone, they're gone pretty much
forever.

>>

>> ## How long will fossil fuels last?

>>

>> Global fossil fuel consumption is on the rise, and new reserves are
becoming harder to find. Those that are discovered are significantly smaller
than the ones that have been found in the past. Oil reserves are a good
example: 16 of the 20 largest oil fields in the world have reached peak level
production - they're simply too small to keep up with global demand.

>>

>> In order to keep average global temperature increases below 1.5°C, we need
to leave up to 80% of our fossil fuel reserves in the ground - but globally,
our reliance on fossil fuels is increasing. Here's how long current fossil
fuel reserves could last:

>>

>> ![Graph showing future energy reserves for coal, gas and

oil](https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/cdn-images/images/7/7/1/3/13177-1-eng-

GB/end-of-fossil-fuels-graph.jpg)

>>

>> *Graph showing future energy reserves for coal, gas and oil.

>>

>> ### Oil

>>

>> Globally, we currently consume the equivalent of over 11 billion tonnes of
oil from fossil fuels every year. Crude oil reserves are vanishing at a rate
of more than 4 billion tonnes a year - so if we carry on as we are, our
**known oil deposits could run out in just over 53 years**.

>>

>> ### Gas

>>

>> If we increase gas production to fill the energy gap left by oil, our known
gas reserves only give us just **52 years left**.

>>

>> ### Coal

>>

>> Although it's often claimed that we have enough coal to last hundreds of
years, this doesn't take into account the need for increased production if we
run out of oil and gas.

>>

>> If we step up production to make up for depleted oil and gas reserves, our
known **coal deposits could be gone in 150 years**.

>>

>> ## Are there any advantages to fossil fuels?

>>

>> While there are some benefits to fossil fuel production, the adverse
effects on the environment and overall public health far outweigh them. But
governments and businesses around the world have placed short term gain from
investing in fossil fuels above the longer term benefits of renewable energy.

>>

>> ## What about fracking?

>>

>> Fracking involves the extraction of shale gas by drilling into the Earth
and pumping boreholes full of a high pressure water mixture. Shale gas is a
type of fossil fuel, which means supplies will eventually run out.

>>

>> It's unclear how much shale is available at fracking sites in the UK but,
because current activity is still in the exploratory phase, virtually no
planning permission is needed to begin drilling. Works have been halted in the
UK due to earthquakes and seismic activity, but the government still provides
backing to fracking companies, despite widespread public opposition.

>>

>> You can find out more about fracking and the environmental risks posed by
fracking activity here.

>>

>> ## The green alternative

>>

>> Unlike fossil fuels, green energy made from wind and solar power is
sustainable, because its generated by resources that **won 't run out**. Plus,
it provides a way to fight climate change by reducing and even offsetting
carbon emissions.

>>

>> For example, the energy payback for solar power technology is just two
years. That means it only takes two years for a solar park to make the same
amount of energy used in its manufacture and installation. And after that, it
can provide decades of clean energy that's better for the planet.

>>

>> If we have any hope of fighting climate change and protecting the future of
our planet, we need to ditch fossil fuels and start investing in renewable
sources of energy. Find out how you can switch to green energy quickly and
easily, and start building a greener Britain.
