Installing massive fields of wind turbines or solar panels in the Sahara
desert could turn parts of the arid landscape green, according to a new study.

Scientists have predicted that shifts in the local environment triggered by
these structures could bring rain to the desert and improve conditions in some
of the world’s most inhospitable regions.

It is generally agreed that universal renewable energy will be essential to
curb carbon emissions from fossil fuels and avoid catastrophic climate change.

However, when deployed on the kind of massive scales required to power the
world, these developments could have unintended consequences.

Scientists predict that when sufficiently large arrays of wind turbines and
solar panels are installed, their presence could change the reflectivity of
the land and movement of air currents.

Wind farms mix warmer air from above with cooler currents lower down, and
solar panels prevent sunlight from being reflected back into the atmosphere.

These effects have the potential to change local climate, and as climate
change is the very thing renewable energy is meant to avoid, there is a need
to understand the implications of this phenomenon.

Floods destroyed eight bridges and ruined crops such as wheat, maize and peas
in the Karimabad valley in northern Pakistan, a mountainous region with many
glaciers. In many parts of the world, glaciers have been in retreat, creating
dangerously large lakes that can cause devastating flooding when the banks
break. Climate change can also increase rainfall in some areas, while bringing
drought to others.

“We want to investigate if we build such large wind and solar farms in the
Sahara that can provide enough clean energy to meet all human energy demand,
what their impact on regional climate would be,” Dr Yan Li from the University
of Illinois told _The Independent_.

Dr Li and his team used a simulation to predict the impact of massive
renewable energy projects in the Sahara and the neighbouring Sahel.

In principle, this area would be ideally placed to house such a project, as it
is sparsely populated and well placed to supply the growing energy demands of
Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

The researchers found that, when installed on a large enough scale, both wind
and solar infrastructure would trigger feedback loops that bring more rainfall
and promote the growth of vegetation in the desert.

In a region that is already feeling the effects of global warming as the
Sahara desert creeps further into the fertile lands bordering it, the
scientists say the net effect would be surprisingly positive.

“Precipitation increases predicted by our model would lead to substantial
improvements of rainfed agriculture in the region, and vegetation increases
would lead to the growth in production of livestock,” said Dr Safa
Motesharrei, a University of Maryland systems scientist and a lead author of
the _Science_ paper discussing these findings.

“The Sahara, the Sahel and the Middle East include some of the driest regions
in the world, while experiencing high growth of population and poverty.

“Our study has major implications for addressing the intertwined
sustainability challenges of the energy-water-food nexus in this region.”

Large-scale renewable energy projects are already underway across parts of
North Africa and the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia’s announcement of a
$200 billion investment in solar power.

The researchers concluded that if deployed effectively, renewable energy
sources could be used not only to clean up the region’s electricity supply but
to push back against the spread of deserts caused by global warming.

“I believe the increasing adoption of renewable energy can save the humanity
from climate change,” said Dr Li.

### About _The Independent_ commenting

Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme,
Independent Minds. It allows our most engaged readers to debate the big
issues, share their own experiences, discuss real-world solutions, and more.
Our journalists will try to respond by joining the threads when they can to
create a true meeting of independent minds. The most insightful comments on
all subjects will be published daily in dedicated articles. You can also
choose to be emailed when someone replies to your comment.

The existing Open Comments threads will continue to exist for those who do not
subscribe to Independent Minds. Due to the sheer scale of this comment
community, we are not able to give each post the same level of attention, but
we have preserved this area in the interests of open debate. Please continue
to respect all commenters and create constructive debates.
