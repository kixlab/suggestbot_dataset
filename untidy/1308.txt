Fact **

Unlike every other developed country on earth (those withvery high human
development on the Human Development index) the United States of America does
not have Universal HealthCare.

**

## Is the United States of America Really the Only Major Developed

Industrialized Country in the World Without Universal HealthCare?

The United States of America is the only " **very highly developed country** "
that doesn't have universal healthcare out of over 50 nations.[1][2][3]

More specifically, when we look at the top 33 major industrialized and
developed countries in the world according to the Human Development Index
(which measures "development" based on like GDP, GNP, per capita income, and
standard of living), we can confirm:

    
        * All the top 33 very highly developed countries except for the U.S. have a form of universal healthcare that is generally working to "cover substantially all of their population,"
    * The same is generally true for the top 34 - 51 countries with very high development (with the note that some of the 34 - 51 are in a transition stage, like Qatar, and some have notable problems with healthcare delivery like Russia; meaning some of these countries don't effectively "cover substantially all of their population" even though they have universal coverage or are moving toward it on-paper).
    

With that in mind, **the list of highly developed countries (who also have
some form of universal healthcare) includes** : 1 Norway 2 Australia 2
Switzerland 4 Germany 5 Denmark 5 Singapore 7 Netherlands 8 Ireland 9 Iceland
10 Canada 11 ~~United States~~ 12 Hong Kong 13 New Zealand 14 Sweden 15
Liechtenstein 16 United Kingdom 17 Japan 18 South Korea 19 Israel 20
Luxembourg 21 France 22 Belgium 23 Finland 24 Austria 25 Slovenia 26 Italy 27
Spain 28 Czech Republic 29 Greece 30 Brunei 30 Estonia 32 Andorra 33 Cyprus 33
Malta 33 Qatar 36 Poland 37 Lithuania 38 Chile 39 Saudi Arabia 40 Slovakia 41
Portugal 42 United Arab Emirates 43 Hungary 44 Latvia 45 Argentina 45 Croatia
47 Bahrain 48 Montenegro 49 Russia 50 Romania 51 Kuwait …

Not only that, but one can keep going down the list of countries by Human
Development Index, and look at all 196 countries, and it won't be until
somewhere mid-way through the high development list that we find a country
with as many uninsured as the United States of America.

**NOTE** : The specifics pertaining to the list above are from the time I
referenced it back in 2017. With that in mind, it is important to understand
that the countries who make the list and their order of ranking change over
time. So in theory a country without universal healthcare could make the top
50 list in future years, in a given year there could be more or less than 50
nations in the "very highly developed country" category, and in a given year
there could be more or less developed nations in general who make the list at
all. That said, countries who make the top of the list tend to also have
universal healthcare. For example, Kazakhstan made the the "very highly
developed country" category in 2017 after I wrote the above, and they also
have a universal healthcare system. Please see the 2018 list for the most
recent figures.

**TIP** : To be very clear, the above doesn't mean that every one of the
aforementioned systems delivers the quality of care the U.S. does, and that
doesn't mean everyone of these systems is "working perfectly," it simply means
every other very highly developed country on earth except the United States of
America has some form of universal coverage (on-paper at least).

**TIP** : Sometimes people phrase this as "the only major country," "the only
developed country," or "the only major industrialized country." To avoid being
vague, one can say, "of the top 50 countries with very high human development
according to the Human Development Index[4], the United States is the only
country without a Universal HealthCare system [with the note that a few
countries are in the process of implementing their universal systems]." The
reason we want to say it like this is because the list also includes countries
with "high development," "medium development," and "low development" (and
semantically we could call any stage of development "developed;" so "major" or
another qualifier makes sense to use). In other words, the factoid we often
hear that "the U.S. is the only major/developed/industrialized country without
universal healthcare" is very much correct, but its accuracy depends on being
specific (after-all, speaking loosely, some "developed and industrialized"
countries ["developed" not "very highly developed" countries] don't have
universal healthcare, like Mexico for example; although, to be fair, Mexico is
making headway).

## What is Universal HealthCare?

Universal healthcare is any healthcare system which provides at least basic
coverage to substantially all its citizens (some developed countries use
models that cover "almost all" citizens; like Slovakia).

It doesn't mean that coverage is free, it doesn't mean all out-of-pocket costs
are covered, it is about providing at least basic health services and ensuring
against financial catastrophe due to healthcare costs.

**TIP** : Learn more about Universal health coverage (UHC) from the World
Health Organization.

**FACTS** : According to the World Health Organization in 2016, every year 100
million people are pushed into poverty and 150 million people suffer financial
catastrophe because of out-of-pocket expenditure on health services.[5] Before
the Affordable Care Act medical debt was estimated to be the number one cause
of bankruptcy. Under the Affordable Care Act filings for bankruptcy dropped
about 50 percent, from 1,536,799 in 2010 to 770,846 in 2016.[6]

WHO: Universal Health Coverage - What does it mean?.

**TIP** : To be clear not all other countries have "single payer," they all
have some form of universal coverage. Single payer is not exactly the same as
universal.

**TIP** : Don't confuse universal healthcare with single payer or a fully
socialized system. Some countries with universal healthcare use a public fund
(single payer), some use a hybrid system of public and private insurance, some
use public healthcare, some use a mix of public and private providers, some
simply subsidize the private system.

Healthcare Around the World.

## Why Isn't the United States HealthCare System Considered Universal?

The American healthcare system isn't universal because it excludes tens of
millions of people based on cost.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA or ObamaCare) made steps toward universal
coverage, but the states that blocked Medicaid expansion (which expanded basic
coverage to those with lower incomes) ensured that the ACA was not able to
cover "substantially all" Americans.

Now, with the ACA being repealed, the United States is moving away even
further away from universal healthcare.

What the U.S. Can Learn About Health Care from Other Countries.

**FACT** : In 2017 the CBO and JCT estimated that enacting the Better Care
Reconciliation Act of 2017 (the repeal and replace plan for the ACA) would
**reduce federal deficits by $321 billion over the coming decade and increase
the number of people who are uninsured by 22 million in 2026 relative to
current law (for a total of 49 million uninsured)**. 49 million uninsured out
of 320 million citizens isn 't just not universal coverage, it is more
uninsured than many undeveloped countries.

> "As I see it, the task of government in its relation to business is to
assist the development of an economic declaration of rights, an economic
constitutional order. This is the common task of statesman and business man.
It is the minimum requirement of a more permanently safe order of things." -
FDR talking about "Second Rights".

FDR Second Bill of Rights Speech Footage.

**MYTH** : The idea that universal healthcare can’t work in the U.S. due to
size alone is a myth. The U.S. has 50 states, each with populations equivalent
to nations with universal coverage. It is also a myth that universal
healthcare isn't working in other countries, some systems work better than
others, but in general countries with universal healthcare have some of the
best healthcare in the world (and many spend less per capita than the
U.S.).[7]

**FACT** : Healthcare was declared a universal human right after America
helped the Allies win WWII. The U.K. immediately adopted a universal
healthcare system (NIH), and most major countries followed suit (including
most of the Axis; Germany, Turkey, and Japan, all have universal healthcare).
Today in America we still argue over whether or not healthcare is a human
right. The side that says it is not won the 2016 election and has sought to
dismantle the current healthcare system (which will result in even more
uninsured).

## What is a Developed Country?

A developed country (AKA an industrialized country with a developed economy)
is a sovereign state that has a highly developed economy and advanced
technological infrastructure relative to other less industrialized nations.

Although the criteria for denoting a country as developed is a little vague,
we can generally point to 39 countries who meet this standard here in 2017
based on factors like gross domestic product (GDP), gross national product
(GNP), the per capita income, level of industrialization, amount of widespread
infrastructure and general standard of living (see a definition of "Developed
Economy").

Of those who meet this standard, the United States is the only country that
doesn't have a universal healthcare system.

Below is a list of the top 51 highly developed countries (a wikipedia list
pulled from the UNDP Human Development Report 2016), literally every country
except the United States on the very high human development list has a
universal healthcare system.[8]

**NOTE** : Some of these countries use a hybrid model where basic care is free
and better care comes at a cost. With that said, you can google any country on
the list with the term "healthcare" and see proof they have some form of
universal healthcare system (I did this for every country on the list already,
I can confirm they do). The only other notes is that some countries, like
Qatar for example, are transitioning into a universal system.[9]

**FACT** : According to the World Health Organization UN Member States (many
of which are not on the "very high development" list) have agreed to try to
achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030, as part of the Sustainable
Development Goals.

* * *

Conclusion

* * *

Of the top 51 countries with very high human development according to the
Human Development Index[11], the United States is the only country without a
Universal HealthCare system [with the note that a few countries are in the
process of implementing their universal systems].

**Supports this as a Fact.**

The strong American ethic of individualism is contrary to universal healthcare
coverage. The Calvinist notion persists that God-fearing, hard workers will
take care of their own needs. If not, it is due to earned punishment by God.
Another factor is the widespread myth that people who don't work and are lazy,
especially minorities, should not be indulged and enabled. The Ayn Rand books
package these ideas as survivaĺ of the fittest. The weak are on their own, and
that's just life. Finally, the history of health insurance as a work benefit
fuels the myth that only the lazy and on-the-dole Americans don't have such
insurance. Many, if not most, Americans ignore the possibility of catastrophic
illness to themselves or family members. Funny how people suddenly
impoverished for the rest of their lives due to astronomical medical costs not
covered by their  
insurance, reconsider and regret their stance agaist universal coverage. Many
Americans are willing to gamble that they won't need health insurance until
they are 35 or 40 years old. "I'm alright, Jack. I'll take my chances." I hope
I live to see universal health care.

It's a shame that the American people have bought hook line and sinker the
sham that the United States of America is the greatest country on earth and we
don't have UH let alone affordable education! Americans spend their whole life
worried about paying for health care, education and retirement! Crazy!!

Well we are great in many ways, but not in terms of healthcare delivery per
capita compared to other "major" nations nor in terms of affordable college
without crushing debt for all citizens. However, in terms of the liberty to
complain about it, we are high on the list 😉

Interestingly, none of the countries listed besides the US have tens of
millions of unhealthy, low-iq, welfare-dependent black and hispanic people who
love to abuse emergency rooms and clinics. That's the problem.

That seems like prejudice view not rooted in reality both in its insinuations
about people living in the US and in its insinuations about other countries on
the list. As, if we factor out the bigotry in the comment, we are left with
just many unhealthy and poor people who lack education… and to that I say…
Yeah! Kind of the point. These countries have universal healthcare and
education and welfare programs so one would assume they (in some cases but not
all cases) have less people suffering from poverty, and/or a lack of access to
education and/or healthcare.

One day we may live up to the standards set forth by Estonia, but its a
marathon and not a sprint in a democracy where we let bigots and non bigots
alike cast their vote.

1 Norway 2 Australia 2 Switzerland 4 Germany 5 Denmark 5 Singapore 7
Netherlands 8 Ireland 9 Iceland 10 Canada 10 United States 12 Hong Kong 13 New

Slovakia 41 Portugal 42 United Arab Emirates 43 Hungary 44 Latvia 45 Argentina
45 Croatia 47 Bahrain 48 Montenegro 49 Russia 50 Romania 51 Kuwait.

This is the list of countries doing better than us by the metric of universal
access to healthcare. Let that sink in. What sort of right-wing nativist
nationalist would want to not even make the top 50?! Its a mind boggling
ideological stance to me.

You can't vote on whether or not something is fact. It is or it isn't. Opinion
has nothing to do with it. But this is America in the 21st century. "Facts"
are subjective and we can make up our own to support our ignorance.

You can vote on whether you believe it to be a fact or not. It is either a
fact or it isn't, but it is also important to hear people's arguments for and
against to move our collective understanding forward.

I lived in France for 17 years with universal healthcare and appreciate it so
much more now that I don't have it anymore. I won't go into the details of how
their healthcare system functions but I will say that most Americans have a
lot of misconceptions about social healthcare; that it is free and subsidized
by the government…Americans are afraid of big government interference. I do
not know how the health care system works in other countries but I can say
that in France they have universal healthcare in which a portion the
healthcare is reimbursed by the government and much of the rest is reimbursed
by a private insurance you take with your employer or you purchase
independently. There are so many other factors involved, such as the fact that
doctor's fees are fixed and determined by the government; 23 euros (which is
equivalent to about $23) for a visit with a general practitioner. Just penny's
compared to a doctor's visit in the U.S. and at least you know how much you
are going to pay, no surprises.  
What I have noticed the most since my return to the U.S is the enormous stress
I feel in regards to finances and bills, something I never experienced in
France. I think Americans are under great stress levels to make money because
they have to plan for retirement, pay for their children's college education
(also free in France if attending a public school) and pay for health
insurance.

**Doesn't beleive this myth.**

We fail to take into account the fact that the U.S. is the worlds marketplace
for pharmecauticals as well as everything else. The price fixing required to
support universal health care in other countries is only possible in many
cases because foreign pharmaceutical companies are able to make up shortfalls
by selling to the U.S. at inflated prices. If we go to Universal health care a
number of "highly developed"countries will find it very difficult indeed to
support their universal health care because WE are no longer paying for it
once we implement the same obviously necessary price fixing required to make
pharmeceuticals and other health care related consumables affordable in the
zero sum downward spiral that socialized medicine always turns into IF any
subject contiguous ethnicity demands a high quality of care. Simply put, you
can only rarely have good fast and cheap all at the same time. You typically
have to sacrifice one or more for the others. Socialized medicine pretends to
"have it all" by robbing peter to pay paul to the temporary political
advantage of some few leaders, but it always eventually outs itself like the
VA or Canada's confession of a broken healthcare system (something their
citizens knew many years ago, and something I've personally witnessed). My
contention is that the U.S. may be the only highly developed country without
universal health care, but it's only because we can afford better generally
speaking. I would even contend that the poor were being better served by
medicare, medicaid before Obamacare as they had a much lower premium with an
equal level of care.

Thomas DeMichele on January 18, 2019

Think you make solid arguments. There are counter points however.

    1. A universal system doesn't have to indiscriminately cover all drugs, it has to at least provide essential care. It can include a supplemental insurance option like Medicare Advantage Drugs (Part D).

    2. The rest of the world piggybacking off of healthcare spending in the US doesn't sound like the ideal system to me. Seems like a reason to make a change if anything.

    3. You can make arguments that, in many respects and for many people in many areas, the VA and Canadian health system work just fine… especially compared to the experience others have in the US.

    4. Some things the ACA (ObamaCare) did was expand Medicaid and make some changes to Medicare. The mandate for Medicaid expansion was blocked, and it was part of the reason costs got thrown out of whack under the ACA. I think many are well served by these programs… but even here there is room for improvements. In Indiana they have some basic premium requirements for Medicaid, one example of how a public program can include a payment option. A popular program that serves the poor, but requires payment, and doesn't include tax credits like the ACA (but does have cost controls).

Simply put, I appreciate the argument, but neither side gets to call it a day
when it comes to healthcare. It is an ongoing debate. Now if only we could get
Congress to have the debate instead of slinging mud and spouting out talking
points while the current system struggles, gouges, and prices in the
uncertainty.

**Supports this as a Fact.**

Pharmaceutical companies in US are very corrupt. We have our share of
corruption in this country. I work for a Corporation that supposedly provides
us with health care coverage, yet it still costs just me 200.00 per month to
cover the basics. My deductible is very high; in the thousands, and it's going
to get worse. Americans will all finally pray for universal health coverage
the day that Corporations decide to not provide for Health Coverage at all,
the same way they chose to not provide pensions anymore. That day is coming.
My parents were not educated, they were blue collar workers. My mom retired
from a dept store 30 years ago with a pension. My dad retired from a grocery
store with a pension. That doesn't happen anymore. No pensions, no medical
benefits when you retire (when we will need them the most). The U.S. govt has
allowed the Pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and doctors control the high
cost of health care. It's a shame and it's plain old corruption hiding behind
government and the medical industry. It's extortion and corruption hiding
behind a so called legitimate industry. And our politicians are no less
corrupt than other country's politicians.

Not only that but US policy makers of both parties are also misleading the
entire nation as to the true causes of this impasse. The real cause is
arguably a trade agreement we signed in the 1990s, the General Agreement on
Trade in Services.

Why don't you fact check me on that one? You can find lots of resources about
it on my web site, and elsewhere, although precious litte when you consider
how important this question is to the country and the world.

My web site is policyspace dot xyz .

Please let me know the outcome of your investigations at my email address.
It's hard to believe we have been so gullible. But I think we have been.

The leaderships of both major US parties are playing us, our whole country,
for fools. These trick agreements lock in so we're in very grave danger.

If we do a number of quite likely things, our status silently changes.

We could also lose millions of jobs.

its complicated how the GATS works, but its not rocket science.

We found out the hard way in the US Gambling case, between Antigua-Barbuda and
the US over the supply of online gambing services, a case that kind of has the
smell of a test case to establish a legal precedent to be used later. There is
even an anonymous letter that led to its filing. Why does that matter? Its all
about hidden traps, and can they be lethal. To democracy.

The same thing seems to be happening with India and the UK.

We're being set up for a big heist of our democratic policy space.

The oligarchies of all these countries can't just come out and say "we're
getting rid of democracy because we're afraid it might happen for a change"
Instead they help each other get rid of it, by pretending to be adversaries,
in the WTO and similar trade bodies. You'll see. (<<<Speculation but supported
so far by Brexit and some other cases pending in the WTO)

The GATS also threatens Social Security and Medicare. Please read the
beginning of the Annex on Financial Services to see how that might happen. It
also is the reason behind the repeal of the good parts of the ACA, (which
appears to likely have been overshadowed from the start by a freeze on
financial services regulation after 1998, a so called standstill clause in the
Understanding on Commitments in Financial Services. There we also pledged to
dismantle or reduce in scope any non conforming monopolies.)

Basically, the 'GATS' agreement as its called trades 'services' a very very
broad term that encompasses 80% of a modern economy. "Everything you cannot
drop on your foot" the UN has a short course in its scope and how disputes
work, here. http://unctad.org/en/docs/edmmisc232add31_en.pdf

It regulates governments for corporations, framing (increasingly endangered)
public services as trade barriers, pushing countries to give up public
services like healthcare, higher education, water, etc. so that multinational
corporations can make money off of them.

The GATS may have also been behind the 2008 financial crash What do you think?
Is a single line at the top of the very last page in the US SoC supplement 3
filed Feb 26, 1998 in Geneva (SC/90/S3) where the US cited the GATS as the
reason we repealed the Glass-Steagall Act - "proof" that an obscure trade
agreement 'caused' the largest financial disaster since the Great Depression?
Or not?

Seems a lot of effort has been devoted to have people blame other things-
anything but that. And now they want to deregulate more.
