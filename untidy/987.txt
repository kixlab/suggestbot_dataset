## Abstract

### BACKGROUND

Cannabis is the most prevalent illicit drug identified in impaired drivers.
The effects of cannabis on driving continue to be debated, making prosecution
and legislation difficult. Historically, delays in sample collection,
evaluating the inactive Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) metabolite
11-nor-9-carboxy-THC, and polydrug use have complicated epidemiologic
evaluations of driver impairment after cannabis use.

### CONTENT

We review and evaluate the current literature on cannabis' effects on driving,
highlighting the epidemiologic and experimental data. Epidemiologic data show
that the risk of involvement in a motor vehicle accident (MVA) increases
approximately 2-fold after cannabis smoking. The adjusted risk of driver
culpability also increases substantially, particularly with increased blood
THC concentrations. Studies that have used urine as the biological matrix have
not shown an association between cannabis and crash risk. Experimental data
show that drivers attempt to compensate by driving more slowly after smoking
cannabis, but control deteriorates with increasing task complexity. Cannabis
smoking increases lane weaving and impaired cognitive function. Critical-
tracking tests, reaction times, divided-attention tasks, and lane-position
variability all show cannabis-induced impairment. Despite purported tolerance
in frequent smokers, complex tasks still show impairment. Combining cannabis
with alcohol enhances impairment, especially lane weaving.

### SUMMARY

Differences in study designs frequently account for inconsistencies in results
between studies. Participant-selection bias and confounding factors attenuate
ostensible cannabis effects, but the association with MVA often retains
significance. Evidence suggests recent smoking and/or blood THC concentrations
2-5 ng/mL are associated with substantial driving impairment, particularly in
occasional smokers. Future cannabis-and-driving research should emphasize
challenging tasks, such as divided attention, and include occasional and
chronic daily cannabis smokers.

Nearly two thirds of US trauma center admissions are due to motor vehicle
accidents (MVAs),3 with almost 60% of such patients testing positive for drugs
or alcohol (1). In 2010, 11.4% of Americans 12 years or older drove under the
influence of alcohol, and 10.6 million drove under the influence of illicit
drugs (2). Despite real or perceived impairment, individuals report a
willingness to drive if there is a good reason (3, 4) or if they believe they
are tolerant (5). Alcohol and cannabis are the drugs most frequently detected
(6).

Cannabis is the most widely consumed illicit substance worldwide (2). In 2009,
125-203 million individuals 15-64 years of age ingested cannabis in the
previous year (7). In the US in 2010, 6.9% of individuals ≥12 years old had
smoked cannabis in the previous month (2). The 2007 National Roadside Survey
reported cannabis as the most common illicit drug quantified in drivers' blood
or oral fluid (OF), with 8.6% of nighttime drivers testing positive for
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (6, 8). Thus, driving under the influence of
cannabis (DUIC) is a growing public health concern.

The acute psychological effects of cannabinoids include euphoria, dysphoria,
sedation, and altered perception (9). The intensity of euphoria/dysphoria
varies with dose, administration route, and vehicle; expectations of effects;
and the cannabis smoker's environment and personality. Cannabis is associated
with subjective physical discomfort and effort, as well as with lethargy (10).
Acute cannabis intoxication produces dose-related impairment in cognitive and
psychomotor functioning, and it can produce risk-taking behavior that can
impair driving skills (11, 12). Dose refers to THC content in cannabis
preparations in milligrams or micrograms per kilogram. Factors influencing
dose include user experience, smoking topography, and cannabis THC
concentration, all of which vary worldwide.

Cannabis effects include alterations in reaction time (RT), perception, short-
term memory, attention, motor skills, tracking, and skilled activities (13,
14).

## Objective and Search Methods

This review presents relevant published data and evaluates current knowledge
of cannabis' effects on driving. The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web
of Science, and Embase were searched through February 20, 2012, for the key
words "cannabis"; "marijuana"; "automobile driving"; "accidents, traffic"; and
"motor vehicles." Additional articles were selected from references in
identified sources.

## DUIC: Epidemiologic Data

Early DUIC epidemiologic studies did not provide strong evidence of cannabis
causality, because individuals with only nonpsychoactive 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC
(THCCOOH) in the blood were included in cannabis-exposed groups (15). THCCOOH
has a long window of detection in blood, well after the acute effects
dissipate (16). In less-than-daily cannabis smokers, THCCOOH was detected up
to 7 days after the smoking of 1 joint containing approximately 38 mg THC
(cutoff, 0.5 ng/mL) (17). THC blood concentrations decrease rapidly after
smoking (16, 18). Blood collection occurs about 90 min after arrest (19) and 3
to 4 h after an accident (20)--long enough that many samples have become
cannabinoid negative, although the blood may have been positive at the time of
the event. There also were few cannabis-only cases; multiple drugs with
potential to contribute to impairment were usually found.

Cannabis smokers share demographic characteristics similar to those of other
groups with a high crash risk, including youth (ages 18-25 years), male sex,
risk taking, and high drunk-driving incidence (8, 20-23). Cannabis tolerance
may develop in frequent smokers, with less impairment than for occasional
smokers with similar THC concentrations (24). Statistically controlling for
these potentially confounding variables sometimes makes results equivocal (25,
26).

Ten epidemiologic studies from 6 countries have investigated the relationship
of MVA to cannabis intake (Tables 1 and ​and2).2). Various case control
designs used self-reporting or objective biological measurements. Adjusting
for confounders reduced the apparent effect sizes relative to crude values and
sometimes caused a loss of statistical significance (21, 27-29). Six studies
evaluated relationships between cannabis exposure and MVA by self-report
(Table 1; see Table 1 in the Data Supplement that accompanies the online
version of this review at http://www.clinchem.org/content/vol59/issue3).
Examining cannabis consumption rather than DUIC has generally produced
nonsignificant or lower odds ratios (ORs) than targeting DUIC. More frequent
cannabis exposure (addiction patients; more than once a week, >4 days/week)
was associated with a significantly increased MVA risk (risk ratio, 1.49; OR,
2.76 and 2.5, respectively) (27, 30, 31). A crude 11.4 OR for MVA injury
within 3 h of cannabis smoking dropped to a nonsignificant OR of 0.8 after
adjusting for confounders (28), whereas DUIC after smoking during the previous
hour almost doubled crash risk [ORs, 1.84 (21) and 2.61 (27)], a finding that
withstood adjustment for demographic characteristics (21, 27) and self-
reported driving under the influence of alcohol (21). Driving within 1 h after
smoking produced higher MVA ORs than driving within 2 h (32). Of 3 case
control studies that included objective cannabis measurement (Table 2), two
studies used urine samples and found no significantly increased ORs (33, 34),
findings that are consistent with cannabis' extended urine-detection window.
In the third study, 204 driver fatalities (blood THC ≥0.6 ng/mL) were compared
with randomly selected control drivers (OF THC ≥5 ng/mL) (29). The crude OR
for fatality was 13.9 for cannabis-positive drivers, and that result retained
significance (OR, 8.6) after adjusting for demographics, time period, and
season. Too few cannabis-only cases had accrued by then to establish a
significant adjusted OR for THC alone. Two recent metaanalyses, each of which
evaluated data from 9 epidemiologic studies (2 in common), documented a
significantly increased MVA risk [OR, 2.66 (35) and 1.92 (36)], even after
controlling for confounding variables.

Studies that presented culpability risk associated with cannabis use are
summarized in Table 3 (see Table 2 in the online Data Supplement for
additional details). Increased blood THC concentrations were associated with a
higher culpability OR. In 2004, Drummer et al. (15) demonstrated a
statistically significant increase in the adjusted OR for crash responsibility
(2.7) for drivers with any measurable blood THC relative to drug-free drivers.
When the blood THC concentration was ≥5 ng/mL, the OR increased to 6.6, a
culpability comparable to that of a 0.15% blood alcohol concentration (BAC).
Among alcohol-negative drivers who were positive for cannabinoids, the 1.39
unadjusted OR was significant for having at least 1 driver-related factor,
which is defined as a potentially unsafe behavior or action contributing to
the collision, in 10 years of Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data
(22). After demographics and driving record were controlled, the OR remained
significant (1.29). FARS drug test results are based on blood or urine;
including urine data may contribute to low ORs, owing to the extended
cannabinoid-detection windows. In France, drivers who had detectable blood THC
concentrations and were involved in fatal crashes had a 3.17 OR for crash
responsibility (1.7 OR after adjustment for demographics, BAC, THC
concentration, and crash time) (37). The driver-responsibility OR increased
with increasing blood THC concentration. Crude (adjusted) ORs were 2.18
(1.57), 2.54 (1.54), 3.78 (2.13), and 4.72 (2.12) for <1, 1-2, 3-4, and ≥5
ng/mL, respectively. Although relatively few studies have evaluated the
relationship of driver responsibility and cannabis intoxication, an increased
blood THC concentration was strongly associated with driver MVA culpability.

The debate on cannabis' effects on driving continues despite these findings,
creating challenges for implementing effective drugged-driving policies (15,
37, 38). To date, 17 states and the District of Columbia have enacted medical
marijuana laws (39). Colorado, which legalized medical marijuana in 2000, has
seen increased numbers of DUIC cases and is considering a 5- ng/mL blood THC
per se law. This proposal generated strong debate, despite the evidence
showing increased culpability (40). In Drummer's 58 cannabis-only culpable MVA
cases (15), the median blood THC concentration was 12 ng/mL, with 84% of the
cases having THC concentrations ≥5 ng/mL. Increasing blood THC concentrations
predict increasing driving impairment. The median blood THC concentration for
456 Norwegian suspected drugged drivers (1997-1999) with blood samples
positive for cannabis only was 2.2 ng/mL (range 0.3-45.3 ng/mL) (24). The
physician who performed the clinical test for impairment (CTI) judged 54% of
the individuals as impaired. Grouping drivers by concentration range and
adjusting for sex, needle marks, and self-reported regular cannabis
consumption produced impairment ORs of 2.4, 2.5, and 3.2 for blood THC
concentrations of 3.0-4.8, 4.9-10.1, and >10.2 ng/mL, respectively. Although
some investigators have described a strong linear relationship between serum
and OF THC concentrations, linear relationships between performance impairment
and serum and OF concentrations are weak (41), and the results for
interindividual variation show that it is inaccurate to predict plasma
concentrations from OF concentrations (42).

In Australia, it is illegal to drive with any detectable blood THC (43).
Police randomly test blood or OF for THC. In the first year of testing, median
THC OF and blood concentrations were 81 ng/mL (range, 5-6484 ng/mL) and 6
ng/mL (range, 3-19 ng/mL), respectively (44). One year later, the median OF
THC concentration was 66.5 ng/mL (median for blood, 6 ng/mL) (43). Mean OF and
blood concentrations were 274.3 and 7.6 ng/mL. In 2005, Switzerland imposed a
punishable blood THC limit of 2.2 ng/mL (45). Of 1704 drivers confirmed to be
THC positive (≥1.0 ng/mL), 1292 (76%) had THC concentrations >2.2 ng/mL. Mean,
median, and maximum blood concentrations were 5.8, 3.8, and 62 ng/mL,
respectively. In cannabis-only cases (57.7%), mean (8.1 ng/mL vs 5.9 ng/mL)
and median (5.8 ng/mL vs 4.1 ng/mL) concentrations were significantly higher
for single vs polydrug users, respectively. A 10-year study of driving under
the influence of drugs in Sweden (8794 THC-positive cases) revealed mean and
median blood THC concentrations of 2.1 ng/mL and 1.0 ng/mL, respectively (19).
Drivers claiming regular cannabis consumption (177 of 456) were significantly
less often (32% vs 55%) to be judged as impaired by CTI than occasional
smokers, with no difference in the median blood THC concentration (24). A
multiple regression model controlling for THC concentration revealed a 1.8
impairment OR for occasional vs regular cannabis smokers.

A 2007 international expert evaluation of epidemiologic and experimental
evidence concluded that risk-based legal limits were unsupportable (38). The
consensus proposal was a serum lower limit of 7-10 ng/mL, which was based on
metaanalyses of experimental data, with a safety margin added for individual
variability and laboratory error. In contrast, Jones et al. (19) advocated
that zero tolerance based on THC limits of quantification is more pragmatic,
because any nonzero science-based per se laws would allow many individuals to
evade prosecution. The debate is complicated by the temporal dissociation of
THC concentrations from acute driving impairment. Karschner et al. (46)
recently reported THC concentrations (≥0.25 ng/mL) in whole blood and plasma
samples obtained from chronic daily cannabis smokers monitored continuously
for abstinence for >7 days. Recently Bosker et al. (47) documented psychomotor
impairment in chronic daily cannabis smokers relative to matched occasional
drug users with respect to validated driving-impairment indicators [critical
tracking (CT) and divided attention] through 21-23 days of abstinence.
Residual cognitive impairment (48) and withdrawal effects, such as sleep
disruption (49), were reported after chronic cannabis smoking. These effects
may impair driving performance.

## DUIC: Experimental Data

Experimental studies of driving performance under the influence of cannabis
are the most rigorous way to evaluate impairment causality. Tables 4 and
​and55 summarize the results of laboratory studies on cannabis-induced
neurocognitive function and driving (simulator and on-road). Study details--
including THC dose, the participants' history of cannabis use, performance
measures, and results--are presented in Tables 3 and 4 in the online Data
Supplement. Past experimental studies often were inconclusive because outcome
measures lacked sensitivity and had not been tailored to specific THC effects
(50, 51). Cannabis drivers appeared to be aware of impairment and attempted to
compensate by driving more slowly and taking fewer risks (4, 10, 52-55).
Perceived driving effort increased under the influence of THC (4). Others
reported that it was not possible to fully compensate because of a control
cost (53). THC's impairing effects increase with task complexity, so a
realistic driving task involves subtasks requiring simultaneous attention.
Study participants performed worse ( _a_ ) on divided-attention tasks (DATs)
(≥2 subtasks performed simultaneously) (52, 53, 56); ( _b_ ) during unexpected
circumstances and choices; or ( _c_ ) during long, monotonous drives.
Cannabis-associated impairment may manifest as a failure to demonstrate
expected practice effects, a result suggesting drivers lose some benefit
afforded by prior experiences (55). An increased RT is among the most common
cannabis-associated impairments (10, 12, 50, 53, 57, 58). Road tracking
(maintaining the correct road position) is one of the most sensitive, dose-
dependent measures (59). THC intake increases lane position variability
(weave) or SD of lateral position (SDLP) (10, 53, 59, 60), as well as steering
wheel variability (10, 53). A recent study demonstrated significant THC-
induced cognitive performance decrements (immediate recall, attention, working
memory, executive function) (61) in occasional smokers over a wide range of
prior cannabis exposure (2-1000 lifetime episodes). One 3.95% THC cigarette
produced a degree of body sway and brake latency similar to that observed for
a 0.05% breath alcohol content (57).

Five controlled cannabis-administration studies examined smoked cannabis'
effects on neurocognitive function (Table 4; see Table 3 in the online Data
Supplement). THC doses of 13 mg and 17 mg did not produce time or distance
perception effects in chronic daily cannabis smokers at approximately 1.25 h
after smoking (62). Individuals who smoked cannabis one or more times per
month underestimated 60- and 120-s intervals 1.25 h after smoking two 3.6% THC
cigarettes (4 puffs/cigarette) administered 2 h apart (56). THC intake (13 and
17 mg) produced minor but significant dose-dependent impairment in a card-
sorting task at approximately 0.75 h after smoking (62) and in a digit-symbol
substitution test (56). At 1 hour after smoking, neither 13 mg nor 17 mg THC
significantly affected decision-making speed in a gambling task (62), although
the percentage of participants who chose least-likely outcomes was
significantly higher after the higher dose than after ingesting placebo. RT in
a Tower of London test (decision-making) after 400 and 500 _μ_ g/kg THC
(approximately 28 mg and 35 mg, respectively) was not significantly affected
in occasional (≤1 day/week) or frequent ( >4 days/week) smokers (5, 63). The
number of correct decisions in the Tower of London tests decreased
significantly at 0.75-5.75 h after recreational smokers (≥5 times in the
previous year) consumed 500 _μ_ g/kg THC (41), but frequent smokers ( >4
days/week) were not significantly affected after 1 h (5). Complex tasks
requiring multiple neurocognitive and/or neuromotor skills were particularly
sensitive to THC's impairing effects and displayed less tolerance. In a
virtual maze, ingestion of 17 mg THC significantly increased wall collisions
(5.5) relative to the placebo (2.9), and 13 mg THC also increased wall
collisions (3.2) (62). Significant CT performance decrements were observed in
occasional smokers 0.25-5.25 h after they smoked 250 _μ_ g/kg (approximately
17.5 mg) THC (41) and at 0.17-7.08 h after they smoked 500 _μ_ g/kg (5, 41).
In these experiments, THC did not significantly affect CT in frequent smokers
( >4 days/week) (5, 63), but DATs (5, 56, 63) and RTs (stop-signal task) (5,
41) reflected impairment in both frequent and occasional smokers.

The results of simulator and on-road studies are briefly summarized in Table 5
and are fully characterized in Table 4 in the online Data Supplement. Driving-
simulator studies offer greater face validity than laboratory studies for
measuring effects of THC on driving effects and are less risky for
participants. Simulators also allow measurement of specific performance
decrements in ways unachievable in actual road-driving experiments. Nine
simulator experiments were examined. RT, road tracking, speed, and speed SD
were the most commonly measured outcomes. THC ingestion dose-dependently
increased RT in 4 of 6 studies (10, 53, 55, 57, 64, 65). Low THC doses (13 and
17 mg) produced significant and dose-dependent increases in RT in a DAT (10),
suggesting a particular sensitivity of a DAT to THC effects. Only 1 simulator
experiment included headway maintenance (53). Smoked THC (19 and 38 mg)
significantly and dose-dependently increased the headway mean and SD relative
to placebo. The most sensitive road-tracking measure was SDLP, results of
which revealed THC-associated impairment in 2 of 4 studies. Relatively low-
dose (13 and 17 mg) smoked THC increased SDLP relative to placebo in
occasional smokers (1-4 times per month) (10), and 19 mg and 38 mg also
produced significant increases (4 cm and 7 cm, respectively) (53). No
significant increases in SDLP were reported after 13 mg in occasional smokers
(1-4 times per month) (3) or after 22.9 mg in smokers who smoked 1-10 times
per month (55). Other monitored road-tracking outcomes were the number of
cones knocked over (57), the percentage of time in a lane (60), and "straddled
line" variables (66). Significant THC-induced impairment was demonstrated
60-330 min (60) and 80 min (66) after 14-52 mg THC was smoked. At an earlier
time point (30 min after smoking), results did not attain significance, but
there were trends toward impairment in "straddling the solid line" (i.e.,
dividing different-direction lanes, _P_ = 0.09) and "straddling the barrier
line" (broken line dividing same-direction lanes, _P_ = 0.08) (66).

The results of Standardized Field Sobriety Tests 55 and 105 min after smoking
corresponded to those of 80-min simulator results in >65% of cases for 14- and
52-mg THC doses. Standardized Field Sobriety Tests classified several
participants as "impaired" when driving performance suggested otherwise, but
line straddling is a relatively insensitive impairment measure. Four of 5
studies detected compensatory decreases in mean speed after THC doses ≥13 mg
(3, 10, 53, 55). When cannabis history was described, all participants were
occasional smokers. No significant THC effect was observed (1.77% or 3.95% THC
cigarettes) for participants who smoked at least weekly but not daily (57).
Speed variability increased after THC smoking relative to placebo in 3 of 6
studies (10, 53, 64), suggesting that the drivers had less vehicular control.
DATs were used in only 2 simulator studies. After smoking 22.9 mg THC,
participants failed to demonstrate the practice effects that were observed
with placebo on a paced auditory serial-addition test during an otherwise
uneventful drive (55). During combined car-following and sign-detection tasks,
smoking of 38 mg THC increased the headway mean and SD (53). In occasional
smokers, 45.7 mg THC also decreased visual search and processing speed (60).

A series of on-road studies (4, 59, 67) conducted in the Netherlands evaluated
the effects of smoked THC on actual driving performance (Table 5). In a 22-km
road-tracking, closed-course test, 100, 200, and 300 _μ_ g/kg of smoked THC
(approximately 7, 14, and 21 mg, respectively) increased SDLP relative to
placebo with no significant differences in the speed mean or SD (4). The
degree of SDLP impairment was the same at 40 min and 100 min after the start
of smoking. In a highway experiment with an escalating dose (100, 200, and 300
_μ_ g/kg THC), 16 participants started driving 45 min after commencing smoking
(59). The drive included a 16-km car-following task (approximately 15 min), a
64-km road-tracking task (approximately 50 min), and a second 16-km car-
following task. THC smoking increased SDLP dose dependently: The lowest dose
produced a slight and nonsignificant SDLP increase, the medium dose a
significant but modest increase, and the highest dose a significant and
substantial increase. The mean headway in the car-following test increased 8,
6, and 2 m for the 100-, 200-, and 300- _μ_ g/kg doses, respectively. The
authors suggested the inverse headway-dose relationship was a practice effect
due to decreasing driver caution with increasing experience with the task,
rather than pharmacodynamic tolerance. THC smoking (100 and 200 _μ_ g/kg)
impaired driving performance on 40-km car-following and road-tracking tasks
(67). Drives were conducted 30 and 75 min after smoking. The headway SD and
SDLP increased significantly relative to placebo after each active dose
(headway SD, by 2.9 and 3.8 m for 100 and 200 _μ_ g/kg, respectively; SDLP, by
2.7 and 3.5 cm). The participants' SDLP values were higher in the second drive
than in the first. The final on-road study administered placebo or 100 _μ_
g/kg smoked THC at 25 min before a 45-min drive through a city (4).
Performance was evaluated with the Driving Proficiency Test. Smoking THC had
no significant effect on total score, vehicle checks, handling, action in
traffic, traffic observation, or turning.

## Combined Alcohol and Cannabis Intake

Cannabis and alcohol share some cognitive and psychomotor effects (10, 41,
68). Both are central nervous system depressants, and alcohol activates the
cannabinoid CB1 receptor pathway (69); however, different effects on driving
behavior were noted at the THC doses evaluated. Alcohol consumption led to
faster driving (3), whereas the cannabis doses typically studied reduced
driving speed. Alcohol inflates self-confidence, causing underestimation of
impairment (10). In contrast, cannabis-influenced drivers occasionally appear
more cautious in experimental settings.

Alcohol and cannabis are commonly identified together in MVA victims. DUIC is
more common among people who also drive drunk (70). Among 322 MVA victims, 30%
of the THC-positive individuals had been drinking alcohol also (1). A larger
French case control study found that >40% of 681 THC-positive drivers involved
in fatal crashes had BACs above the 0.05% legal limit (37). Over a 90-day
period, 30.6% of 108 drivers admitted to the University of Maryland Medical
Center Shock Trauma Center tested positive for alcohol (93.5% with BAC values
≥0.07%); one third of the drivers also tested positive for cannabis
(urinalysis, 50 ng/mL cutoff; analyte not specified) (23). Alcohol was
detected with THC in nearly 20% of Swiss cases in which the THC concentration
in blood exceeded the 2.2- ng/mL legal limit (45).

Among 727 French drivers involved in fatal accidents with blood THC
concentrations ≥1 ng/mL, 40% of the drivers also had an illegal BAC, ≥0.05%
(20). Drunk driving (with or without cannabis) produced a higher single-
vehicle accident incidence (62%) than did DUIC (34%). Drivers whose blood
contained only cannabis were 2.3 times more likely to be culpable than those
without cannabis or alcohol. This responsibility index (the percentage
responsible divided by the percentage not responsible) increased to 9.4 for
those with only alcohol in their blood, and to 14.1 with both alcohol and
cannabis. THC-positive drivers with BAC values ≥0.05% had a culpability OR
2.9, relative to those with a BAC ≥0.05% alone (15), implying that THC
enhanced alcohol's impairing effects. In a case-controlled logistic regression
analysis, patients in Ontario, Canada, who sought treatment for combined
alcohol and cannabis abuse had a significantly higher likelihood of a prior
conviction for driving while intoxicated (DWI) (OR, 3.65) relative to randomly
chosen driver controls matched by age and sex (71). Cannabis-only patients
were not significantly different from controls for DWI convictions, whereas
alcohol-only patients had a prior DWI conviction OR of 5.19. DWI convictions
were not necessarily concurrent with consumption of drug(s) for which the
individuals were subsequently treated. A significant risk ratio of 5.8 for a
driving-related injury within an hour after cannabis exposure (case-crossover
self-report study) nearly doubled, to a 10.9 risk ratio for alcohol and
cannabis combined (32).

Four studies included laboratory data on alcohol and cannabis interactions
(Table 4; see Table 5 in the online Data Supplement). In a time-estimation
task, two 3.6% THC cigarettes (4 puffs each, 2 h apart) yielded underestimated
time targets (56). Alcohol consumption [0.6 g/kg (male) and 0.5 g/kg (female)]
produced overestimations. In combination, these effects canceled each other.
Two of 3 studies showed a cannabis-alcohol interaction on DATs, suggesting
this test was a sensitive measure. In occasional smokers (once to 4 times per
month), some THC (13 mg) or alcohol (target BAC, 0.05%) impairment effects
occurred 15-75 min after smoking (3). Although each substance increased false-
alarm responses, the greatest effect occurred in combination. Performance
impairment and subjective effects were generally strongest after consuming
both drugs. Frequent smokers (≥4 days/week) showed increased control losses
after 400 _μ_ g/kg THC and 0.05% and 0.07% BACs (63). Combinations produced
the greatest effects, although whether alcohol and THC produced additive or
synergistic effects was unclear. The percentage of drivers judged as impaired
increased with increasing blood THC concentration and BAC (72). When neither
alcohol (blood cutoff, 0.001%) nor THC (blood limit of detection, 0.2 ng/ mL)
was detected, 14% of CTI observations showed impairment. Alcohol alone at BACs
of 0.001%-0.05% (low) and  >0.05% (high) was associated with 77% and 95%
impairment, respectively. THC concentrations between 0.30 and 1.6 ng/mL were
associated with 45%, 91%, and 97% impairment for 0, low, and high BACs,
respectively. THC concentrations ≥1.6 ng/mL were associated with corresponding
impairments of 53%, 93%, and 100%. These CTI data indicate progressive and
increasing impairment with increasing alcohol and THC combinations.

One simulator study showed a cannabis-alcohol interaction (Table 5). In
occasional smokers (once to 4 times per month), a 0.05% target BAC and 13 mg
smoked THC increased the SDLP relative to either drug alone or placebo, which
did not differ (3). Alcohol alone increased drive speed relative to that for
THC; THC alone decreased speed. The combination produced a borderline-
significant speed increase relative to THC alone. No significant effect was
observed for the speed SD. Alcohol and THC consumption increased the total
number of collisions (5 of 12) relative to either drug alone (2 of 12 and 3 of
12 for alcohol and THC, respectively).

The most straightforward cannabis-alcohol effect appeared in a study that
administered 0, 100 _μ_ g/kg (approximately 7 mg), or 200 _μ_ g/kg
(approximately 14 mg) THC and alcohol (target BACs, 0% or 0.04%) (Table 5)
(59, 67). Alcohol plus the high THC dose increased the RT by 36%; this dosing
condition was the only one that affected RT. Alcohol or the low THC dose alone
slightly increased SDLP; the higher THC dose caused moderate impairment.
Neither drug alone significantly increased the time out of lane. Combining
either THC dose with alcohol severely increased SDLP and dose-dependently
increased the time out of lane. Combining the 100- and 200- _μ_ g/kg doses
with 0.04% BAC created a degree of impairment equivalent to that of 0.09% and
0.14% BAC, respectively. Visual search for traffic at intersections was
significantly decreased by 3% relative to placebo for a 0.04% BAC and after
consumption of 100 _μ_ g/kg THC, an effect not observed with either drug alone
(4).

Although several studies have reported additive or synergistic cannabis-
alcohol effects, some studies reported no interactions. The inconsistencies
were likely due to differences in procedures, outcome measures, and cannabis
history for the study populations. After combining moderate drug doses in
occasional smokers, no interaction effect was observed on free word recall,
digit-symbol substitution, logical reasoning (56), standing steadiness, or
equilibrium (56, 65). Frequent smokers did not show a cannabis-alcohol
interaction in a Tower of London task, a stop-signal task, or CT after smoking
400 _μ_ g/kg (approximately 28 mg) THC and ingesting 0.05% or 0.07% BAC (63).
A 3.3% (approximately 30 mg) THC cigarette decreased equilibrium scores, and
0.5 g/kg alcohol increased brake latency, with neither effect significantly
altered with the combination (65). The authors speculated that the lack of
interaction was an impairment-awareness artifact, coupled with the expectation
of an "emergency." A recent 9-session simulator experiment that investigated
0, 19, and 38 mg THC and 0, 0.4, and 0.6 g/kg alcohol in all possible
combinations demonstrated substantial impairment caused by THC alone (both
active doses) (53). Both alcohol doses increased SDLP; the lower alcohol dose
also increased the speed mean and SD. No interaction effects were observed,
most likely because the alcohol doses were low. The mean achieved BACs were
0%, 0.02%, and 0.05% for placebo, low alcohol, and high alcohol conditions,
respectively.

## Preventing DUIC

One of the greatest challenges is dealing with public attitudes toward DUIC.
One fourth (26.3%) of 320 drivers who smoked cannabis in the previous year
indicated a >90% likelihood of future DUIC, even after having been shown data
on increased crash risk (73). Only 7.5% reported they would be unlikely to
drive (0%-10% likelihood). The majority indicated a >50% probability of future
DUIC, even given the higher MVA risk. Regular smokers who had previously DUIC
emphasized that publicity campaigns would not deter them from future DUIC
(74). Past experience had convinced them that they could compensate for
cannabis-associated performance decrements. Most believed cannabis caused
minimal driving impairment; a few considered it to have no or even a positive
effect on driving. A high likelihood of apprehension and punishment was a
better deterrent. Given a hypothetical scenario with no chance of punishment,
three quarters indicated a >50% chance for DUIC, and half indicated a >90%
likelihood (73). In contrast, given a hypothetical scenario of a high degree
of certainty of punishment, participants were significantly less willing to
DUIC (OR, 0.2; _P_ < 0.001). In a small study on DUIC attitudes, however, no
one who reported having been stopped by police while DUIC indicated that they
were deterred by this experience (none were charged) (74). Study findings
suggested that random roadside testing (with arrest of those found cannabis
positive) would be a better deterrent than advertising campaigns promoting the
hazards of DUIC.

## Conclusions/Discussion

Many epidemiology studies have involved selection bias. Some evaluated only
specific populations, such as deceased drivers or those being treated for
substance abuse or addiction. Case control studies are highly useful, but they
may be biased by the selection of controls. Case and control populations may
come from different time periods or include different cannabis-detection
cutoffs or matrices (e.g., blood analysis for killed drivers vs OF for living
drivers). The accuracy of self-reported information varies, depending on the
data-collection methods. Self-reported prevalence estimates are often
underestimated, owing to the sensitivity of illicit drug-related information
(27, 28). Even when objective measures of cannabis exposure were used,
detection cutoffs were varied and not always reported. Urine testing has an
extended cannabis-detection window and cannot establish a valid temporal
association with crash risk.

Several studies have shown increased crash and culpability risks, even after
adjusting for such confounders as age, sex, risky behaviors, and polypharmacy.
Increased blood THC concentrations and driving within an hour after smoking
were strongly associated with higher crash and culpability risks. Human
laboratory-controlled drug-administration studies showed THC-induced driving-
performance decrements within the first hour that lasted ≥2 h after smoking,
results that are largely consistent with epidemiologic data. Laboratory-based
impairment experiments identified DATs and executive-function tasks as the
most sensitive to cannabis' effects. Investigations of actual driving
performance have demonstrated dose-dependent THC impairment in road tracking,
although only low to moderate THC doses were administered because of safety
concerns. Simulator technology has improved since it was first used for
impairment experiments, having progressed from rudimentary controls and a
projected cyclorama (64) to full passenger cars, interactive screens with more
complete fields of view, advanced driver monitoring via built-in cameras,
realistic 3-dimensional audio output to enhance the simulated drive, and
motion platforms that simulate physical driving sensations (10, 53, 55). Such
advanced driving simulators are an ideal platform for future research because
they combine realistic driving scenarios with highly controlled and measurable
environments and provide a degree of safety not possible with on-road
experiments. Driving simulators are particularly necessary when challenging
drivers with difficult tasks (such as DATs and real-time decision-making
processes) and when evaluating higher THC doses. Simulator studies from the
last decade have demonstrated significant THC impairment of RT and the SDLP.
THC smoking (22.9 and 38 mg) inhibited expected practice effects on DATs and
produced deleterious performance effects, respectively (53, 55). Depending on
the THC dose, driving speed may be reduced (3, 10, 53), particularly while
multitasking (55), and headway may be increased (53). These results suggest
impairment awareness and compensation but do not preclude control decrements.

Inconsistencies in findings are likely due to differences in study design; the
population and setting (simulator vs road); the sophistication of the
equipment; the sensitivity and specificity of the tasks (including drive
length); THC dosage; and time after smoking. Differences in driver
compensation while under observation may contribute to the variability in
results. Future work should focus on extended segments of monotonous driving
(which draw drivers into a state of complacency or sleepiness) followed by
sudden changes requiring reaction, realistic situations presenting decision
dilemmas, and DATs. These constructs appear the most sensitive to THC's
impairing influence.

Combining alcohol with THC exacerbated the observed effects, especially with
respect to RT and SDLP. Low (100 _μ_ g/kg) and moderate (200 _μ_ g/kg) THC
doses, combined with a 0.04% BAC produced road-tracking impairment to a degree
similar to BACs of 0.09% and 0.14% (59). Because consuming alcohol and
cannabis together is common, fully evaluating their combined impact on driving
performance is essential. The use of clinically relevant THC and alcohol doses
in future studies is necessary to generate findings that can better inform
public policy. In previous research, the administration of low THC and alcohol
doses often accounted for a lack of observed effects, at least in part.
Cannabis smokers typically self-titrate doses, and alcohol drinkers consume
enough alcohol to attain BACs ≥0.05%. Most self-administered cannabis and
alcohol doses are higher than the doses administered in many research studies.

Tolerance to acute impairment is an important consideration for future
research and policy debates. DAT and tracking tasks have demonstrated
impairment in chronic cannabis smokers, but other parameters have not (5, 63).
The debate regarding per se and zero-tolerance drugged-driving laws is a
prominent issue. Increased blood THC concentrations are strongly associated
with increased crash risk, but there is no direct correlation between driving
impairment and THC concentration.

DUIC is an important public health and safety concern that requires the
development of an evidence-based policy and legislation targeted at drugs and
driving. Impaired driving endangers individuals inside and outside the
vehicle. Consuming cannabis before driving, with or without alcohol, is a
common occurrence that produces substantial morbidity and mortality on the
roadway. Research is needed to further define cannabis' effects on driving
performance and to provide the scientific basis for laws to improve road
safety.
