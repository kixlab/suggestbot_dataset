The **right to keep and bear arms in the United States** is a fundamental
right[1][2][3] protected by the Second Amendment to the United States
Constitution, part of the Bill of Rights, and by the constitutions of most
U.S. states.[4] The Second Amendment declares:

> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.[5][6]

In the United States, which has an English common law tradition, the concept
of a right to keep and bear arms was recognized prior to the creation of a
written national constitution.[7] When colonists in the Thirteen Colonies
rebelled against British control during the American Revolution they cited the
1689 English Bill of Rights as an example.

## English precedent[edit]

See also: Assize of Arms of 1181

The American understanding of the right to keep and bear arms was influenced
by the 1689 English Bill of Rights, an Act of Parliament, which also dealt
with personal defence by Protestant English subjects.

The Bill of Rights did not create a new right to have arms but rather
rescinded and deplored acts of the deposed King James II, a Roman Catholic,
who had forced the disarming of Protestants, while arming and deploying armed
Catholics contrary to Law (among other alleged violations of individual
rights). The Bill of Rights provided that Protestants could bear arms for
their defence as permitted by law. It also established that the power to
regulate the right to bear arms belonged to Parliament, not the monarch.[8]

Sir William Blackstone wrote in the eighteenth century about the right to have
arms being auxiliary to the "natural right of resistance and self-
preservation", but conceded that the right was subject to their suitability
and allowance by law.

> The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall at present
mention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition
and degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the same
statute and is indeed a public allowance, under due restrictions, of the
natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of
society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of
oppression.[9]

## Civilian usage meaning[edit]

In _United States v. Cruikshank_ (1876), the U.S. Supreme Court recognized
that the right to arms preexisted the Constitution and in that case and in
_Presser v. Illinois_ (1886) recognized that the Second Amendment protected
the right from being infringed by Congress. In _United States v. Miller_
(1939), the Court again recognized that the right to arms is individually held
and, citing the Tennessee case of _Aymette v State_ , indicated that it
protected the right to keep and bear arms that are "part of the ordinary
military equipment" or the use of which could "contribute to the common
defense." In its first opportunity to rule specifically on whose right the
Second Amendment protects, _District of Columbia v. Heller_ (2008), the Court
ruled that the amendment protects an individual right "to keep and carry arms
in case of confrontation," not contingent on service in a militia, while
indicating, in dicta, that restrictions on the possession of firearms by
felons and the mentally ill, on the carrying of arms in sensitive locations,
and with respect to the conditions on the sale of firearms could pass
constitutional muster. In the 2010 case of McDonald v. Chicago, the Court
applied incorporation doctrine to extend the Second Amendment's protections
nationwide.

The people's right to have their own arms for their defense is described in
the philosophical and political writings of Aristotle, Cicero, John Locke,
Machiavelli, the English Whigs and others.[10][ _need quotation to verify_ ]
Though possessing arms appears to be distinct from "bearing" them, the
possession of arms is recognized as necessary for and a logical precursor to
the bearing of arms.[11] Don Kates, a civil liberties lawyer, cites historic
English usage describing the "right to keep and bear _their private
arms_."[12] Likewise, Sayoko Blodgett-Ford notes a non-military usage of the
phrase in a pamphlet widely circulated by the dissenting minority dating from
the time of the Pennsylvania ratifying convention for the U.S. Constitution:

> [T]he people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and
their own state, or the United States, or the purpose of killing game; and no
law shall be passed for disarming the people or any of them, unless for crimes
committed ...[13]

In commentary written by Judge Garwood in _United States v. Emerson_ , the
United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded in 2001
that:[14]

> ... there are numerous instances of the phrase 'bear arms' being used to
describe a civilian's carrying of arms. Early constitutional provisions or
declarations of rights in at least some ten different states speak of the
right of the 'people' [or 'citizen' or 'citizens'] "to bear arms in defense of
themselves [or 'himself'] and the state,' or equivalent words, thus
indisputably reflecting that under common usage 'bear arms' was in no sense
restricted to bearing arms in military service. See _Bliss v. Commonwealth_ ,
13 Am. Dec. 251, 12 Ky. 90 (Ky. 1822).[15]

Similarly, in a released Senate report on the Right to Keep and Bear Arms,
Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee
on the Constitution, states:

> They argue that the Second Amendment's words "right of the people" mean "a
right of the state" – apparently overlooking the impact of those same words
when used in the First and Fourth Amendments. The "right of the people" to
assemble or to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures is not
contested as an individual guarantee. Still they ignore consistency and claim
that the right to "bear arms" relates only to military uses. This not only
violates a consistent constitutional reading of "right of the people" but also
ignores that the second amendment protects a right to "keep" arms. "When our
ancestors forged a land "conceived in liberty", they did so with musket and
rifle. When they reacted to attempts to dissolve their free institutions, and
established their identity as a free nation, they did so as a nation of armed
freemen. When they sought to record forever a guarantee of their rights, they
devoted one full amendment out of ten to nothing but the protection of their
right to keep and bear arms against governmental interference. Under my
chairmanship the Subcommittee on the Constitution will concern itself with a
proper recognition of, and respect for, this right most valued by free
men.[16]

Likewise, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in _District of Columbia v. Heller_
(2008), No. 07-290, that "[t]he Second Amendment protects an individual right
to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that
arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the
home."[17]

## Military service and civilian usage meanings[edit]

Some historians have argued that prior to and through the 18th century, the
expression "bear arms" appeared exclusively in military contexts, as opposed
to the use of firearms by civilians.[18][19][20][21]

> In late-eighteenth-century parlance, _bearing arms_ was a term of art with
an obvious military and legal connotation. ... As a review of the Library of
Congress's data base of congressional proceedings in the revolutionary and
early national periods reveals, the thirty uses of 'bear arms' and 'bearing
arms' in bills, statutes, and debates of the Continental, Confederation, and
United States' Congresses between 1774 and 1821 invariably occur in a context
exclusively focused on the army or the militia.[22]

However, this conclusion is disputed and may be due to selection bias, which
arises from the use of a limited selection of government documents that
overwhelmingly refer to matters of military service.[23] Commenting on this
previous research, other historians note:

> Searching more comprehensive collections of English language works published
before 1820 shows that there are a number of uses that ... have nothing to do
with military service ... [and] The common law was in agreement. Edward
Christian's edition of Blackstone's Commentaries that appeared in 1790s
described the rights of Englishmen (which every American colonist had been
promised) in these terms 'everyone is at liberty to keep or carry a gun, if he
does not use it for the [unlawful] destruction of game.' This right was
separate from militia duties.[23]

The Oxford English Dictionary defines the term _to bear arms_ as: _"to serve
as a soldier, do military service, fight,"_ dating to about 1330.

Garry Wills, author and history professor at Northwestern University, has
written of the origin of the term _bear arms_ :

> By legal and other channels, the Latin " _arma ferre_ " entered deeply into
the European language of war. Bearing arms is such a synonym for waging war
that Shakespeare can call a just war " _'justborne arms_ " and a civil war "
_self-borne arms_." Even outside the special phrase " _bear arms_ ," much of
the noun's use echoes Latin phrases: to be under arms ( _sub armis_ ), the
call to arms ( _ad arma_ ), to follow arms ( _armasequi_ ), to take arms (
_armacapere_ ), to lay down arms ( _arma pœnere_ ). "Arms" is a profession
that one brother chooses the way another choose law or the church. An issue
undergoes the arbitrament of arms."..."One does not bear arms against a rabbit
...".[24]

Garry Wills also cites Greek and Latin etymology:

> ..."Bear Arms" refers to military service, which is why the plural is used
(based on Greek 'hopla pherein' and Latin 'arma ferre') – one does not bear
arm, or bear an arm. The word means, etymologically, 'equipment' (from the
root ar-* in verbs like 'ararisko', to fit out). It refers to the 'equipage'
of war. Thus 'bear arms' can be used of naval as well as artillery warfare,
since the "profession of arms" refers to all military callings.[25]

Historically, the right to keep and bear arms, whether considered an
individual or a collective or a militia right, did not originate fully formed
in the Bill of Rights in 1791; rather, the Second Amendment was the
codification of the six-centuries-old responsibility to keep and bear arms for
king and country that was inherited from the English Colonists that settled
North America, tracing its origin back to the Assize of Arms of 1181 that
occurred during the reign of Henry II. Through being codified in the United
States Constitution, the common law right was continued and guaranteed for the
People, and statutory law enacted subsequently by Congress cannot extinguish
the pre-existing common law right to keep and bear arms.[26]

The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution refers to a pre-
existing right to keep and bear arms:

> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.[27]

The right is often presented in the United States as being an unenumerated,
pre-existing right, such as provided for by the Ninth Amendment to the United
States Constitution,[26] interpreted by some as providing for unenumerated
rights, and therefore implicitly a right to keep and bear arms:

> The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

Some have seen the Second Amendment as derivative of a common law right to
keep and bear arms; Thomas B. McAffee & Michael J. Quinlan, writing in the
North Carolina Law Review said _"... Madison did not invent the right to keep
and bear arms when he drafted the Second Amendment – the right was pre-
existing at both common law and in the early state constitutions."_ [28]

Akhil Reed Amar similarly notes the basis of Common Law for the first ten
amendments of the U.S. Constitution, "following John Randolph Tucker's famous
oral argument in the 1887 Chicago anarchist case, Spies v. Illinois":

> Though originally the first ten Amendments were adopted as limitations on
Federal power, yet insofar as they secure and recognize fundamental rights –
common law rights – of the man, they make them privileges and immunities of
the man as citizen of the United States ...[29]

Uviller and Merkel hold that the right to bear arms was not reserved for the
state, but rather was an individual and personal right for arms only to the
extent needed to maintain a well regulated militia to support the state. They
also hold that a militia recognizable to the framers of the Constitution has
ceased to exist in the United States resulting from deliberate Congressional
legislation and also societal neglect; nonetheless, "Technically, all males
aged seventeen to forty-five are members of the unorganized militia, but that
status has no practical legal significance."[30][31]

A few academic writers published their opinions in several works:

> From the text as well as a fair understanding of the contemporary ethic
regarding arms and liberty, it seems to us overwhelmingly evident that the
principal purpose of the Amendment was to secure a personal, individual
entitlement to the possession and use of arms. We cannot, however, (as the
individual rights contingent generally does) disregard entirely the first part
of the text proclaiming a well regulated militia necessary to the security of
a free state.[32]

>

> ... we understand the Second Amendment as though it read: "Inasmuch as and
so long as a well regulated Militia shall be necessary to the security of a
free state and so long as privately held arms shall be essential to the
maintenance thereof, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not
be infringed." "..to us, the language of the Amendment cannot support a right
to personal weaponry independent of the social value of a regulated
organization of armed citizens.[33] [34][35]

## Early commentary in federal courts[edit]

See also: Firearm case law in the United States

In the century following the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the intended
meaning and application of the Second Amendment drew less interest than it
does in modern times.[36] The vast majority of regulation was done by states,
and the first case law on weapons regulation dealt with state interpretations
of the Second Amendment. A notable exception to this general rule was _Houston
v. Moore_ , 18 U.S. 1 (1820), where the Supreme Court mentioned the Second
Amendment in an aside.[37]

### _Dred Scott v. Sandford_ [edit]

In the Nineteenth century considerable attention in public discourse and the
courts was directed to the issue of arming of slaves (prior to the Civil War),
and later to the right of slaves to belong to militia and the arming of these
individuals. Most famously this is seen in the court arguments of the 1857
court case _Dred Scott v. Sandford_ , whether the slave Dred Scott could be a
citizen with rights, including the right to bear arms. This debate about the
rights of slaves and former slaves often included the usage of the term 'bear
arms' with the meaning of individuals having or not having the right to
possess firearms.

In the _Dred Scott_ decision, the opinion of the court stated that if African
Americans were considered U.S. citizens, "It would give to persons of the
negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one State of the Union, the
right ... to keep and carry arms wherever they went."[38][39]

## Early commentary in state courts[edit]

The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution is a federal provision.
In 2010, this "fundamental" and "individual" right was "fully incorporated"
with the 14th Amendment per the SCOTUS ruling made in _McDonald v. City of
Chicago_ , which upheld the prior opinion made in _District of Columbia v.
Heller_. Each of the fifty states also has its own state constitution. Forty-
four states have chosen to explicitly embody a right to bear arms into their
state constitutions.[40] Each of the state constitutions, state laws, and
state courts addresses the state-based right to bear arms distinctly within
its respective jurisdictions.[41] The degree and the nature of the protection,
prohibition, and regulation at the state level varies from state to state. The
District of Columbia, not being a state, falls within the federal
jurisdiction.

Approximately thirty-one states have explicitly chosen to include the right to
arms for "individual right", "defense of self", "defense of home" or similarly
worded reasons. Approximately thirteen states, as with the U.S. Constitution,
did not choose to explicitly include "individual", "self" or "home" wording
associated with a right to bear arms for their specific states.

Approximately twenty-eight states have explicitly chosen to include the right
to bear arms for "security of a free state", "defense of state", "common
defense" or similarly worded reasons, as with the U.S. Constitution.
Approximately sixteen states did not choose to include explicitly "free
state", "defense of state" or "common defense" wording for their specific
state. Whether the inclusion of these kinds of wording in state constitutions
has relevance to the issue of whether implicit "individual" rights exist, or
whether such rights (if any) are implicitly protected by the states'
constitutions or by the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, remains a matter
of dispute. However, since the SCOTUS has "fully incorporated" the 2nd and
14th Amendments in their 2010 opinion and order in _McDonald v. City of
Chicago_ , the right to keep and bear arms is "fully applicable" to the states
and limits the states on any and all regulations and restrictions they choose
to take, and federal Constitutional rights take precedence over state, local
and other laws that regulate to "Right of Lawful Citizens to keep and bear
Arms for self-defense, a 'central component' of the 2nd Amendment" (see
_McDonald v. City of Chicago_ (SC 2010)).

Regarding the state interpretations of these state and the federal
constitutional rights to bear arms, state courts have addressed the meaning of
these specific rights in considerable detail. Two different models have
emerged from state jurisprudence: an individual right (defense of self or
home) and a collective (defense of the state) right. It should be noted,
however, that the states cannot lessen or restrict any Bill of Rights
guarantee that has been "fully incorporated" (American jurisprudence) and that
the right that is "fully incorporated" also applies to the respective State
Constitutions; again, the states can only "add to" these rights but can never
"diminish" these rights by state and local laws.

### Bliss[edit]

_Bliss v. Commonwealth_ (1822, KY)[42] addressed the right to bear arms
pursuant to Art. 10, Sec. 23 of the Second Constitution of Kentucky
(1799):[43] "That the rights of the citizens to bear arms in defense of
themselves and the State shall not be questioned." This was interpreted to
include the right to carry a concealed sword in a cane. This case has been
described as about "a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons
[that] was violative of the Second Amendment."[44] Others, however, have seen
no conflict with the Second Amendment by the Commonwealth of Kentucky's
statute under consideration in _Bliss_ since "The Kentucky law was aimed at
concealed weapons. No one saw any conflict with the Second Amendment. As a
matter of fact, most of the few people who considered the question at all
believed amendments to the U.S. Constitution did not apply to state laws."[45]

The Kentucky High Court stated in _Bliss_ , "But it should not be forgotten,
that it is not only a part of the right that is secured by the constitution;
it is the right entire and complete, as it existed at the adoption of the
constitution; and if any portion of that right be impaired, immaterial how
small the part may be, and immaterial the order of time at which it be done,
it is equally forbidden by the constitution."[42] The "constitution" mentioned
in this quote refers to Kentucky's Constitution.[16]

The case prompted outrage in the Kentucky House, all the while recognizing
that Section 23 of the Second Constitution of Kentucky (1799) did guarantee
individuals the right to bear arms. The _Bliss_ ruling, to the extent that it
dealt with concealed weapons, was overturned by constitutional amendment with
Section 26 in Kentucky's Third Constitution (1850) banning the future carrying
of concealed weapons, while still asserting that the bearing of arms in
defense of themselves and the state was an individual and collective right in
the Commonwealth of Kentucky. This recognition has remained to the present day
in the Commonwealth of Kentucky's Fourth Constitution, enacted in 1891, in
Section 1, Article 7, that guarantees "The right to bear arms in defense of
themselves and of the State, subject to the power of the General Assembly to
enact laws to prevent persons from carrying concealed weapons." As noted in
the Northern Kentucky Law Review Second Amendment Symposium: Rights in
Conflict in the 1980s, vol. 10, no. 1, 1982, p. 155, "The first state court
decision resulting from the "right to bear arms" issue was _Bliss v.
Commonwealth_. The court held that "the right of citizens to bear arms in
defense of themselves and the State must be preserved entire, ..." "This
holding was unique because it stated that the right to bear arms is absolute
and unqualified."[46][47]

The importance of _Bliss_ is also seen from the defense subsequently given
against a murder charge in Kentucky against Mattews Ward, who in 1852 pulled
out a concealed pistol and fatally wounded his brother's teacher over an
accusation regarding eating chestnuts in class. Ward's defense team consisted
of eighteen lawyers, including U.S. Senator John Crittenden, former Governor
of Kentucky, and former United States Attorney General. The defense
successfully defended Ward in 1854 through an assertion that "a man has a
right to carry arms; I am aware of nothing in the laws of God or man,
prohibiting it. The Constitution of Kentucky and our Bill of Rights guarantee
it. The Legislature once passed an act forbidding it, but it was decided
unconstitutional, and overruled by our highest tribunal, the Court of
Appeals." As noted by Cornell, "Ward's lawyers took advantage of the doctrine
advanced in _Bliss_ and wrapped their client's action under the banner of a
constitutional right to bear arms. Ward was acquitted."[48]

### Aymette[edit]

In _Aymette v. State_ , 21 Tenn. 154, 156 (1840), the Tennessee Supreme Court
construed the guarantee in Tennessee's 1834 Constitution that 'the free white
men of this State have a right to Keep and bear arms for their common
defence.'[49] Explaining that the provision was adopted with the same goals as
the Federal Constitution's Second Amendment, the court wrote: "The words 'bear
arms' ... have reference to their military use, and were not employed to mean
wearing them about the person as part of the dress. As the object for which
the right to keep and bear arms is secured, is of general and public nature,
to be exercised by the people in a body, for their common defense, so the
arms, the right to keep which is secured, are such as are usually employed in
civilized warfare, and that constitute the ordinary military equipment."

  *     1. The act of 1837-8, ch. 137, sec. 2, which prohibits any person from wearing any Bowie knife, or Arkansas toothpick, or other knife or weapon in form, shape or size resembling a Bowie knife or Arkansas toothpick under his clothes, or concealed about his person, does not conflict with the 26th section of the first article of the bill of rights, securing to the free white citizens the right to keep and bear arms for their common defense.
  *     1. The arms, the right to keep and bear which is secured by the constitution, are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and constitute the ordinary military equipment; the legislature have the power to prohibit the keeping or wearing weapons dangerous to the peace and safety of the citizens, and which are not usual in civilized warfare.
  *     1. The right to keep and bear arms for the common defense, is a great political right. It respects the citizens on the one hand, and the rulers on the other; and although this right must be inviolably preserved, it does not follow that the legislature is prohibited from passing laws regulating the manner in which these arms may be employed.

### Nunn[edit]

The Georgia Supreme Court ruled in _Nunn v. Georgia_ (Nunn v. State, 1 Ga. (1
Kel.) 243 (1846)) that a state law banning handguns was an unconstitutional
violation of the Second Amendment. This was the first gun control measure to
be overturned on Second Amendment grounds.[50] The Supreme Court in its ruling
in _District of Columbia v. Heller_ said _Nunn_ "perfectly captured the way in
which the operative clause of the Second Amendment furthers the purpose
announced in the prefatory clause."[51]

> The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not
militia only, to keep and bear _arms_ of every description, and not _such_
merely as are used by the _militia_ , shall not be _infringed_ , curtailed, or
broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to
be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so
vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any
law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which
contravenes this _right_ , originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled
under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-
established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the
colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Charta![52]

### Buzzard[edit]

In _State v. Buzzard_ (1842, Ark), the Arkansas high court adopted a militia-
based, political interpretation, reading of the right to bear arms under state
law, and upheld the 21st section of the second article of the Arkansas
Constitution that declared, "that the free white men of this State shall have
a right to keep and bear arms for their common defense",[53] while rejecting a
challenge to a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons. Buzzard
had carried a concealed weapon and stood "indicted by virtue of the authority
of the 13th section of an act of the Legislature prohibiting any person
wearing a pistol, dirk, large knife or sword-cane _concealed as a weapon_ ,
unless upon a journey, under the penalties of fine and imprisonment." Justice
Lacy, in a dissenting opinion in _Buzzard_ , summarizing the majority
viewpoint to which he disagreed, declared:

> That the words "a well regulated militia being necessary for the security of
a free State", and the words "common defense" clearly show the true intent and
meaning of these Constitutions [i.e., Ark. and U.S.] and prove that it is a
political and not an individual right, and, of course, that the State, in her
legislative capacity, has the right to regulate and control it: This being the
case, then the people, neither individually nor collectively, have the right
to keep and bear arms."[53]

Joel Prentiss Bishop's influential _Commentaries on the Law of Statutory
Crimes_ (1873) took Buzzard's militia-based interpretation, a view that Bishop
characterized as the "Arkansas doctrine", as the orthodox view of the right to
bear arms in American law.[53][54]

Political scientist Earl Kruschke has categorized both _Bliss_ and _Buzzard_
as being "cases illustrating the individual view."[55] Professor Eugene Volokh
revealed, in the California Political Review, that a statement in a concurring
opinion in _Buzzard_ was the only support for a collective right view of the
right to keep and bear arms in the 19th century.[56]

### _Salina v. Blaksley_ [edit]

In 1905, the Kansas Supreme Court in _Salina v. Blaksley_ [57] made the first
collective right judicial interpretation.[58] The Kansas high court declared:
"That the provision in question applies only to the right to bear arms as a
member of the state militia, or some other military organization provided for
by law, is also apparent from the second amendment to the federal
Constitution, which says: 'A well regulated militia, being necessary to the
security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall
not be infringed.'"

## Modern commentary[edit]

### Interpretive Models[edit]

Further information: Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and
Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution

Three models of interpreting the right to bear arms in the United States
commonly exist. These three models are founded on differing interpretations of
the Second Amendment, _"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the
security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall
not be infringed."_

The first model, the individual-rights model, holds that a right of
individuals is to own and possess firearms, much as the First Amendment
protects a right of individuals to engage in free speech.[59] This view was
confirmed by the Supreme Court in _District of Columbia v. Heller_ (2008) than
had previous interpretations by the Court. Prior to the Supreme Court's ruling
in _Heller_ there was a split among the federal courts, with nine of the
federal circuit courts of appeal supporting a modified collective rights view,
two of the federal circuits supporting an individual rights view, and one
federal circuit court having not addressed the question.[60]

The second two models focus on the preamble, or "purpose" clause, of the
Amendment – the words _"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the
security of a free State."_ The second model, the collective model, holds that
the right to bear arms belongs to the people collectively rather than to
individuals, under the belief that the right's only purpose is to enable
states to maintain a militia.

The third model, the modified collective model, holds that the right to keep
and bear arms exists only for individuals actively serving in the militia, and
then only pursuant to such regulations as may be prescribed.[59]

### Federal case commentary[edit]

Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia in 2008 wrote that the right to bear arms
is not unlimited and is subject to reasonable prohibitions and regulations and
subsequently federal court rulings have upheld existing gun prohibitions and
regulations.[61]

Nadine Strossen, former president of the American Civil Liberties Union, has
stated that the individual rights model must yield to reasonable
regulation.[62] Strossen said "it is no more absolute than freedom of speech
or any other right in the Constitution. No right is absolute; the government
is always allowed to restrict the right if it can satisfy Constitutional
strict scrutiny and show the restriction is narrowly tailored to promote a
goal of compelling importance."[63]

In October 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
stated:

> there are numerous instances of the phrase 'bear arms' being used to
describe a civilian's carrying of arms. Early constitutional provisions or
declarations of rights in at least some ten different states speak of the
right of the 'people' [or 'citizen' or 'citizens'] "to bear arms in defense of
themselves [or 'himself'] and the state,' or equivalent words, thus
indisputably reflecting that under common usage 'bear arms' was in no sense
restricted to bearing arms in military service."[64][65]

#### _United States v. Miller_ [edit]

Main article: United States v. Miller

In _United States v. Miller_ , 307 U.S. 174 (1939), the Supreme Court rejected
a Second Amendment challenge to the National Firearms Act prohibiting the
interstate transportation of unregistered Title II weapons:

> Jack Miller and Frank Layton "did unlawfully ... transport in interstate
commerce from ... Claremore ... Oklahoma to ... Siloam Springs ... Arkansas a
certain firearm ... a double barrel ... shotgun having a barrel less than 18
inches in length ... at the time of so transporting said firearm in interstate
commerce ... not having registered said firearm as required by Section 1132d
of Title 26, United States Code, ... and not having in their possession a
stamp-affixed written order ... as provided by Section 1132C ...[66]

In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice McReynolds, the Supreme Court
stated "the objection that the Act usurps police power reserved to the States
is plainly untenable."[67] As the Court explained:

> In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a
'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time
has some reasonable relationship to any preservation or efficiency of a well
regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the
right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial
notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that
its use could contribute to the common defense.[68]

Gun rights advocates claim that the Court in _Miller_ ruled that the Second
Amendment protected the right to keep arms that are part of "ordinary military
equipment."[69] They also claim that the Court did not consider the question
of whether the sawed-off shotgun in the case would be an applicable weapon for
personal defense, instead looking solely at the weapon's suitability for the
"common defense."[70] Law professor Andrew McClurg states, "The only certainty
about _Miller_ is that it failed to give either side a clear-cut victory. Most
modern scholars recognize this fact."[71]

#### _District of Columbia v. Heller_ [edit]

Main article: District of Columbia v. Heller

According to the syllabus prepared by the U.S. Supreme Court Reporter of
Decisions,[72] in _District of Columbia v. Heller_ , 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the
Supreme Court held[72][73] that the Second Amendment protects an individual
right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use
that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the
home. pp. 2–53.[72][73]

Other legal summaries of the court's findings in this case are
similar.[74][75][76][77][78][79]

#### _McDonald v. Chicago_ [edit]

Main article: McDonald v. Chicago

On June 28, 2010, the Supreme Court in _McDonald v. Chicago_ , 561 U.S. 3025
(2010) held that the Second Amendment was fully incorporated within the 14th
Amendment. This means that the court ruled that the Second Amendment limits
state and local governments to the same extent that it limits the federal
government.[80] It also remanded a case regarding a Chicago handgun
prohibition. Four of the five Justices in the majority voted to do so by way
of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, while the fifth
Justice, Clarence Thomas, voted to do so through the amendment's Privileges or
Immunities Clause.[81]

## The politics of the right to keep and bear arms[edit]

Main article: Gun politics in the United States

Interest groups, primarily in the United States, exert political pressure for
and against legislation limiting the right to keep and bear arms. This
political debate in America is organized between those who seek stricter
regulations and those who believe gun regulations violate the Second Amendment
protection of a right to keep and bear arms.[82] The largest advocacy group in
this regard is the National Rifle Association, and its political wing, the NRA
Institute for Legislative Action. The NRA has been described as one of the
largest and most powerful political special interest groups in the United
States.[83] Several other groups including the Gun Owners of America and the
Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, while smaller in size,
are also politically active.[84] The main gun control advocacy group is the
Brady Campaign which has been described as considerably less effective than
gun-rights organizations.[85]

Archived from the original on 2013-05-23. "The right of self-preservation, including the right of self-defense, has been suggested to be within the protection of the Ninth Amendment. Thus, although some courts have refused to hold that the Ninth Amendment protects a right to possess firearms, laws which restrict the ability of law-abiding citizens to possess firearms for the purpose of self-defense could be said to violate the Ninth Amendment. Another common interpretation of the Ninth Amendment is that it protects rights which were recognized at common law as being among the "fundamental rights of Englishmen." The common law, as described in Blackstone's Commentaries, has been carried into American jurisprudence. One such right protected at common law was the right to self-defense and the right to possess and carry weapons for defensive purposes. Hobbes described the right to self-defense as a fundamental natural right of which persons can not justly be deprived by any law or covenant. Blackstone listed self-defense and the right to carry weapons for self-defense as one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen. Blackstone further described the right to self-defense as "the primary law of nature, so it is not, nor can it be in fact, taken away by the law of society"

Medieval monks might enjoy the question: is a military force that developed out of an ancient construct known as "the militia" still a militia though it boasts none of the defining characteristics of that form of military organization, and is, actually, in character the contradiction of many of them? It's a little like the parable of Aristotle's knife: if I break the blade of my knife and replace it, and then put a new handle on it, is it still the same knife?"

In contrast, legal critics of the "individualist view" repudiated the _Emerson_ analysis on various grounds. Judge Robert M. Parker, while concurring in the _Emerson_ result, labeled the majority's analysis as _obiter dicta_ , irrelevant to the outcome of the case (see _Emerson_ , Spitzer 2003). Moreover, the thoroughness of the _Emerson_ analysis was criticized because the court's rendered opinion relied substantially on interpretations submitted in a "brief presented by one party" (Spitzer 2003).
