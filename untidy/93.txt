## What People Are Saying About Abort73...

##### Page URL: https://abort73.com/feedback

Abort73 touched my heart because I was a pregnant 17 year old in 1973 and I
was offered an abortion as a solution. I said No. That kid born in 1973 is now
a responsible husband and father of 4 children of his own. I'm pretty sure he
is glad he was born. I know I am!

Abort73 is one of the best sites I've come across. I didn't read the entire
site, but I hope you've also covered info about the morning after pills. I'd
like info about the reasons women give for later-term abortion as well.

Abort73.com is a decent site. It avoids the crazy pro-life stereotypes.

Abort73 is extremely informative with detailed facts that can be backed up. It
shows truth with compassion for the women involved in abortion. The facts
regarding abortion are easier to prove than I knew. The pro-choice side has no
medical, political or spiritual basis for being correct.

In my position as pro-choice, I was under the impression that women could only
obtain an abortion up to 12 weeks, unless there was a danger to the health of
the mother. It seems that I have been grossly uninformed in my beliefs.

Your reasons are skewed and your information is irresponsible. You assume a
correlation between child abuse and legalization of abortion. Child abuse has
always been prevalent—only in the last 50 years has maltreatment of children
received attention. Also, regarding more minorities having abortions and
implying that is genocide. Perhaps fewer people of color have good access or
money to spend on birth control. Maybe more minorities cannot afford to feed
another mouth due to socioeconomic factors. To imply selective abortion based
on race is irresponsible.

Abort73 is a great resource. The information appears well-researched and even-
headed. The only criticism I can make is that in your pages you do not report
the fact that abortion and infanticide have been a plight since the beginning
of humankind. To be fair you do imply it in the historical pages, but don't
appear to address the issue further... Thank you again for your public
service. I want to do more to advance the pro-life cause and I pray for the
day when the rights of the unborn will be respected.

I do not agree with your position on tubal pregnancy. No matter what the
situation, taking a life is morally wrong. As you know, it is not always fatal
for the mother & in some cases not fatal to the child. If death for the child
occurs, it must occur naturally. If a child is dying of malnutrition, where it
is too late to intervene, should we kill the child because death is
inevitable?

I appreciate the nice look of the site and the information that is available.
I saw a t-shirt about whether we would change our mind if they (abortion
docs?) used guns. I have always wanted to see someone develop a cartoon of a
baby in the womb holding a little handgun, ready to shoot the abortionist who
is trying to pull the baby out of the womb. I think such a graphic would make
an interesting point.

I can see clearly that a woman has more options than abortion and that it is
clearly a moral wrong to kill a fetus at any time in their life. There is no
reason why a woman would have the right to kill a baby that is growing in her
body.

I think this website is way too biased. Statistics are thrown in there to make
the point look good. There is flawed logic all over this website. I understand
people have certain opinions about abortion, but to provide a chopped up
Frankenstein website of various facts that happen to fit your views is
unethical and debunks your credibility. If you want to have a scientific
website, you need to leave your biased opinions out of it.

I have wept hard this morning about a lot of the [abortion stats on your

get non-pro-life folks to check you out as your name does not make it clear at

help this cause, will pray about it more, but just wanted to share and
encourage you to keep it up. And thanks; I learned a lot and feel spurred on.

I found this site to be very credible and informative. The articles were
passionate and unwavering, without being offensive or preachy. I appreciated
that I was not confronted with horrific and upsetting pictures when looking
for information not specifically about the actual abortion procedure, which
would have caused me not to explore any further. I am going to look through
some more of the website, and hope to find some more information about the
ethics of IVF, which is often ignored by pro-life movements.

(Abort73 is) very informative. I came to the site to get a fix on the number
of abortions that take place a year in the US. I found much great info that I
want to share, including the page about punishing the woman that has an

become more active in opposing abortion.

(Abort73 is) Pretty one-sided. The fact that you think abortion is never the
answer means you don't understand how pregnancy can endanger the life of a
mother, nor do you empathize with children who would be born so malformed that
they'd live short lives full of pain. Plus, you don't seem to have a plan for
what we as a society would do with 800,000+ babies that would be born every
year if abortion were not an option. As someone who works with kids in the
foster care system, I find that to be critically shortsighted.

This website offends me to no end. It is a woman's right to do what she wants
with her body. Also, many of these facts are untrue. The fetus DOES NOT feel
pain during the procedure and these are not facts. They are VERY opinionated
comments that are rude and offensive. You should be ashamed.

abortion.

I am very impressed with the way your "Common Objections" article, using only
pure logic, dismantled the widely-accepted "reasons" to justify induced
abortion. It is a welcome alternative to the moralistic emotionalism of pro-
life lobbyists. Abort73 will be a resource for me as I agree with your
organization's premise that education aimed at bringing about a change in
attitude is the productive course of action to greatly reduce-and potentially
eliminate-this unethical practice. It is well organized and excellently
written.

I find this website informational, but it does not think about the women
carrying the child. It is selfish. Also, whether a woman has an abortion is no
one's business but her own. It is not your choice nor should it be okay for
you to shame another woman for doing what she thinks is right. My opinion on
abortion is still the same. I am on here to find information to write a paper
for my religion class and honestly I am appalled and disappointed that I am

Abort73 is a very good website. It provides convincing counterarguments to

have a better understanding of abortion law and its evolution. Abort73.com is
very informative without being sensational. This is wonderful--abortion is
sensational enough without adding personal drama to the mix. If there were

There is seriously a website that is anti-abortion?!?! Nowadays?!? Of course a

lifetime. Every person is different, and not every baby should be born. Look
what's happening in third-world countries! They keep having babies that are
suffering. Birth control is what should be enforced more. No man will ever
understand what it's like for a women. Not one. Why is this such a big deal
for people who haven't been through that type of situation? You are all stuck
in an ignorant bubble and need to take your f ** _ing blinders off. Seriously.
Pull your heads out of your a_ * and maybe worry about the environment. For

I think Abort73.com is AWESOME! By reading the comments, I've come to realize
that many women who have had abortions and still support 'the right to
choose,' seem to be SO ANGRY! They REALLY lash out at those who support
life'!! To me, it sound like they're using their anger to suppress their
guilt! [Back in high school], because of going to public schools with VERY
liberal teachers... , I became pretty liberal. When my cousin came to me and
told me that she was pregnant by her boyfriend, who she hardly knew, I tried
to talk her into getting an abortion! I told her that having a baby would ruin
her future... THANK GOD, SHE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME and decided to keep the baby!
... After her healthy baby boy was born, and I saw him and held him for the
first time, I began to feel SO guilty... Since then, my eyes have been opened,
and I have been against abortion!!!

After looking at your website, I find it an absolute disgrace that you are
making women and young girls feel ashamed for having abortions. How dare any
of you inflict your harsh, insensitive and outright ignorant views on abortion
and how 'wrong' it is? You have no idea on what circumstances surround women
who find themselves to be pregnant. These ridiculous comparisons and opinions
on abortion only make females who have been through it feel guilty and wrong
for doing what they have done. Clearly this website has been created by self-
righteous and deluded people who have nothing better to do than make others
feel ashamed and guilty about such a sensitive and tough thing for a girl to

fight to end abortion. [My goal is to] help people look at abortion for what
it truly is--murder, and not a "choice." I'd like to be be able to do this in
a way that doesn't trigger a defensive justification but promotes reevaluation
of one's innermost views on abortion.

[Abort73 is] the most factual abortion site I've come across; it tells you
everything you'd want to know and hides nothing under the rug. Aside from
facts, it also provides outlets for help. It's made me see with more clarity
how 'human' the foetuses are in comparison to what the pro-abortionists would
have people believe.

(Abort73 is) very educational and informative. All women contemplating an
abortion at any stage in their pregnancy should be required to review all
these ultrasounds, photographs and other data pertinent to their stage of
pregnancy that clearly depicts exactly what stage the woman's baby is at in
her womb, prior to her being allowed to abort her fetus. I'm amazed at how
developed a fetus is at 5 weeks.... It's nothing less than miraculous!

I've learned that abortion isn't just one of those words you can forget about
because it has such an impact in your life, whether it's happening to you or
someone around you. It is a big deal, and it isn't okay for a woman to kill
her baby. This is an issue that must be stopped and put to an end.

raised, but because of that fact my mom didn't think it right for me to see
how violent abortion is, because "there's nothing you can do about it." So, it
wasn't until late last year that I finally went to abort73, and I was shocked!
I had no idea. Now I see. I'm not blind any more! I ended the ignorance! :) I

(Through Abort73,) I have learned how to respond to more sophisticated pro-
choice arguments such as those advanced by Nathan Nobis. There is, however, a
limit to how far we can permeate. At the end of the day I realize that
opposition to abortion is ultimately rooted in presuppositions that transcend
the secular realm. Thus it is important to bring the atheistic pro-choice
person who also supports infanticide or sees no value in human life to a
belief in God before we can have a chance to convince him/her of the
immorality of abortion. In short, the abortion debate encompasses more than
just abortion.

I think that what you're doing is admirable. However, abortion will take place
even if made illegal. There are many cases of women seeking illegal ways to
rid themselves of a pregnancy. You must realize that making it legal is the
only way to keep those women safe. I understand your case against it and never
would I condone myself or anyone I know to receive an abortion but I still
believe it should remain legal.

I respect the (Abort73) website. While I do not support abortion as a common
form of birth control, I do see a use for the procedure from a medical point
of view in specific cases, and therefore feel it should remain legal. Further,
I respect and support your website as a source of information for pregnant
women seeking answers concerning abortion, especially in a case that falls out
the realm I above described. Overall, the website is a way to communicate the
point of view without harassing women and subjecting your point of view to
those not interested, so I actually support it. And you do truly seem to seek
dialogue and conversation rather than scare tactics and politics, which I
respect and appreciate.

almost any question answered in a clear and logical way. Most sites come
primarily from a religious angle to try to argue against abortion. Although
that's OK, and I share their view completely, the world can then easily
dismiss those "religious nuts." With all the technology and scientific and
biological evidence that's available now, it is crucial to present that side
of it to an unbelieving world. Thank you for doing that. I will be

I have always been very against abortion, but before visiting Abort73, I'm not
sure how well I could have argued my position to a pro-choice friend. Now I
know what I believe about preborn life, and I know WHY I believe it. I know
how to argue what I know is true. I have learned so much and am constantly
shocked, saddened, and DRIVEN by the statistics on Abort73. This is by far my
favorite pro-life website. The information is overwelming. Many essays and
reports have benefited from the excelent points and reliable statisitcs you
give! I also apreciate the links to other pro-life organizations and sites,
some of which I have been able to get involved with and may not have found if
not for you! My favorite thing about this website is how... friendly it is...
as in, not the least bit dull and boring. It's well formatted, and very modern
looking. It grabs your attention and keeps it. Plus, it looks very "teen"...
and I'm sure a large percentage of your visiters are teens. I have ordered 5
shirts from you and more for my friends, who LOVE them! I was impressed by how
fast even a very large order arrived. I LOVE that the shirts are comfortable
and totally cute, and that they fit well. They come in great colors! Most
importantly for me, I feel like I'm on a mission when I'm wearing an Abort73
shirt... like people are watching. I believe when I wear the shirts, it's my
responsibility to be informed about the issue of abortion and ready to explain
the meaning and reason for the shirt whenever someone asks. I usually carry
the cards around too, just in case. I also really appreciate the idea that one
slogan isn't going to change someone's mind, and the logic of pointing them to
the site. That makes a lot of sense! I am so impressed with Abort73.com, I
talk about it to my frinds all the time and I highly reccomend it! Thank you

I always felt I was "pro choice" in the sense that abortion would never be
right for me, but if that's the choice others around me made, I would respect
it. I now feel I could never condone this act of violence, and my heart is
breaking for all these babies who were "discarded" in this unmerciful, cruel
way. It was beautiful to read how the fetus forms from the moment of
conception through to birth. I guess I never really thought of a baby as a
baby when it's in the blastocyst stage. I feel relief now for standing up to
my husband and family when they told me I had too abort my fifth child. He's a

I would have actually described abortion as a "severe injustice." However, I
have never actively promoted this belief or done anything to try to change the
hearts or minds of those who support the legal right to abortion in the US
(except for debating the topic with such people, including my own family and
significant other, and occasionally, passively passing along information that
support my beliefs to my friends). Stumbling on [the Abort73] website and
exploring the information available has compelled me to do a lot more research
on my own and fueled my longtime belief - my gut instinct - that abortion is
inhumane. I will do anything I can to learn more about this problem and what
can be done. I also appreciate that this site is not dripping with Christian-
based sentiment. As a non-Christian (though I hold many fundamental Christian
values), I feel that, in general, constantly intertwining religious views with
moral beliefs does not sit well with most non-Christians who are in need of
convincing. I'm glad that [Abort73] seems someone recognizes this.

fantastic. I love the name, too! If people could tell from the shirt that it
is pro-life they might never say something to me. But because it is ambiguous,
they approach me and we have constructive dialogue. One thing that is
particularly useful to me is the medical testimony about where life begins.

racial discrimination of abortion, and the perverse roots/intent of Planned

I didn't realize that many abortion clinics were for profit. I had also never
seen a concise, non-dramatized presentation of what actually happens during an
abortion. Opinions are articulately expressed and drawn from a wide variety of

practical arguments against abortions legality.

This is the best pro-life website I have visited -- in fact, it may be one of
the best "cause" websites I've seen. The first things I see when the home page
appears are 2- and 5-minute videos succinctly explaining the pro-life case for
the unborn. This is a perfect design, because short visuals are the best way
to communicate your message in a hyper-visual culture. The second things are
noticed were the five reasons for pro-life at the bottom of the home page.
Clicking the first one brings up a compelling yet brief argument, which is
then followed up by a possible objection, which is then answered by the next
article. I love how each article ends with a possible objection from the
prochoice side and then a link to the pro-life rebuttal. Each well-crafted
argument invigorates my mind and makes me want to read more. These pages are
addicting -- I keep on clicking the links at the bottom! I absolutely love the
format and the way the case for the unborn is unfolded. I am planning a pro-

I once believed that while abortion was wrong, it could not be made illegal
because that would be to legislate morality, and you cannot make people
believe as you do. By reading the articles on this site, however, I have come
to see that while people cannot be made to change, to do nothing about it is
just as wrong as doing the act yourself. People cannot be allowed to just do
whatever they want. Should we make all murder legal then, because some people
will do it anyway? No. We have a moral obligation, as the human race, to mete
out justice. And letting people make the choice to abort their children is
just dead wrong.

I am doing an essay on abortion and I myself had two when I was younger, some
20+ years ago. Had I been given something like this to see (that my child had
a beating heart), I would not of had done it. There should have been a
different approach, one more realistic. Let [women] see their child, let them
know their defenseless baby will feel the pain when he/she is being sucked out
of the womb. I never wanted to look back, but karma has a way of letting us
know just what it was that we did! This is a web site that I will be visiting
more often, and if I can help anybody with a decision like this, well this is
were I am going to send them, to Abort73.com.

helps to explain and spread the truth and the facts about abortion so
efficiently. :) I am glad that God has led me to this site! :) I already
purchased one of your shirts, and I proudly wear it around! I have been asked

you so much for what you are doing!

Abort73 is a fantastic place to find all that you need to know about abortion
and why it is wrong. The way it was written is very clear but fair. I really
dislike sites that use very strong language to attempt to undermine the other
side. The text gave lots of information and images that both challenged the
reader more and gave for a more interesting read. Abort73.com is one of the
only sites that I've found that not only tells you how you can help, but also
brings to light what many people are not educated about.

I knew about abortion and what it was, but I didn't really know much more than
that. I was not a good arguer when it came to the topic, but now I feel I can
more accurately argue the pro-life view. I wrote an argumentative paper for
one of my classes on abortion and used Abort73.com as a source. I got a ton of
information from this site. I found it to be a very valuable research tool.

You are all a bunch of people who really don't know anything. All of your
"statistics" were irrelevant and didn't even matter. You had no real proof
that the baby is really even a human being before 8 weeks... you should really
be euthanized. Planned parenthood and other places like it are the reason
there ARENT MORE UNWANTED PREGNANCIES YOU IDIOTS. They provide birthcontrol
and information about sex and contraceptives. and all I got from your childish
website was a bunch of nonsense, I don't think I actually learned one thing
that would actually help me or any one else with their daily lives. And god
help the people who actually listen to this garbage. You should all be ashamed
of yourselves for being so low on the evolutionary scale that you actually
think your right. You must be catholics or something.

[Abort73] has been enlightening. I used to think I was Pro-Choice but not Pro-
Abortion. I tried to walk a tightrope, in that people should be given the
choice to do the right thing instead of the wrong thing. I believed if
educated they would make the right choice most of the time. But look at drugs,
education is out there but people still use them. I love this program as it
does education. I'm beginning to think abortion should not be a choice anyone
should be allowed to make.

My thoughts on abortion have really been developed and shaped by the
information I've found on Abort73 and sites like it. My stance on the issue is
more clarified and clear now... I was always pro-life, but never really knew
how to explain my position with sound knowledge, and I knew I couldn't simply
rely on my Christian faith (so many people just don't care about what God has
to say). Abort73 really helped me have information on just what it was I stood
for, and now any chance I get, I tell my friends about what I've learned. I
often wish I was a biology teacher and could teach youth about this stuff!

This is a fantastic website. I like how it presents factual information on

think the best way to help pro-choice people understand, or even convert to
the pro-life position (or at least have an open mind about it) is by simply
giving the facts and exposing truths. Using reputable sources and updated
information is important. And I like how the website is appealing to people
who aren't religious too. You don't have to be religious to be pro-life. Your
site also targets young people, which I think is important. I know WAY TOO

I love the [approach] of Abort73. I do not believe that the government should
be able to control what we do or do not do with our own bodies, but I believe
that anything can be prevented through education. I remember in my Family Life
class in middle school, whenever someone asked any of us what we would do if
we got pregnant, we would just simply state abortion. No one knew anything
about the process and its morals; it just seemed like a mystical alternative
to taking care of a baby. Then, in the eighth grade, we were assigned a
research paper that could be on anything we wanted it to be. Because I knew
little about the subject of abortion, I chose that topic. At the beginning of
that paper, I was completely pro-abortion. But when I presented my project to
the class a few months later, I had completely changed my view on the subject.
And after presenting to my class, many of friends went up to me and told me
that I had changed their opinions of abortion too! I am so glad that Abort73
is here to let everyone know the facts about abortion. Hopefully through this
campaign, many lives will be saved.

decide whether or not to have an abortion. Just because it is fundamentally
wrong for some, should not influence whether or not abortion should be
considered legal. Closed minded zombies.

I was kind of on the fence, riding between pro-life and pro-choice. I would
never have an abortion myself, but at that point I thought it was alright for
other women too because it was THEIR body. Now, I realize just how cruel and
inhumane abortion is and we should be doing all we can to protect the innocent
children of God.

I had an abortion at 18, and I've never for a moment regretted that decision
or second-guessed the wisdom of it. I suppose that makes me a monster
according this website's worldview, which mocks the idea that a women could
have an abortion because they care about being the best mother they possibly
could be, and wouldn't want to bring another human being into the world
without doing everything in their power to provide the best life possible for
him or her. I don't understand how people could be so blind to these nuanced
but honest reasons. Its because I care about children and being a good mother
that I would rather 'kill' something that had the possibility of becoming a
child while it is still a tiny clump of cells than have a child I wouldn't be
able to care for the way it would deserve, or abandon it to the vagaries of
the adoption system where I would have no idea of how it could be raised.

My view on abortion has been strongly influenced. I always have believed that
abortion is always the wrong choice, but this website puts even more into
perspective and it shocks me to see how bad it really can be. I never thought
I could be more against abortion before... but now... I'm way more against it
than I was.

I have always believed firmly that abortion was wrong, but I had been
struggling with the morality and even viability of working to outlaw it... the
job of the government isn't to legislate morality. People have free will, and
with it, a right to make even wrong choices. They'll be the worse off for it,
but they can't be stopped from sinning. We can't completely outlaw smoking, or
jumping off bridges, or insults. These are all bad things, but to make them
criminal would be illegal. And so I had put abortion into this category of
things that we can't legislate for other people, and I was affected by the
arguments that outlawing abortion would only cause women to seek dangerous
illegal abortions in Mexico or someplace. But this site argued the case
against abortion in such a clear, rational way... completely free of the
fanaticism and slogans and repetition I've winced at in other pro-life
stances. [It showed me that] it is okay and even necessary to outlaw things
that cross the line of hurting another person... My previous stance seems so
weak... This is the best pro-life site I've ever seen. I saw that the issue
with illegal abortions has been addressed on this site, to my pleasant
surprise, and of course the arguments I already knew are discussed as soundly
as I've ever seen them.

Primarily emotive, subjective vomit combined with thinly disguised opinion
masquerading as medical 'fact', especially the evidence cited in defense of
your claims that "individual human life begins at fertilization". The section
of your site that infuriated me the most was the area dealing with the
morality of abortion in regard to rape victims. Again premised on the
(subjective) assumption that life begins at conception, surely even ignorant
individuals such as yourselves cannot truly think that a few examples of
anecdotal evidence represents the majority of rape victims.

It is an informative site. But in all reality the world is becoming a horrible
place and is hard enough to survive and get by without a child. If a couple
feels they would not be able to provide for a child or give it the life it
deserves there is nothing wrong with abortion if you plan on waiting to a
later date and learning from your mistake. Although it should be done fairly
soon before 7 weeks I would say.

I think your site looks very enticing and yet you rely on old data to give the
appearance that your site relies on new research. Your site also manipulates
data to support your agenda using "data" that has been poorly executed and
purposely misleading. This is unfortunate as well as scientifically
reprehensible. I have been searching to find a pro-life site or even pro-life
research studies that rely on very current science (past 6-10 years) to make
its point and can find none. Instead, all I find are sites that mix very old
data with a tiny amount of "newish" data in an attempt to skew the real
results of the research. Your site does this as does every single anti-choice
site.

were violently dismembered during the abortion process. Although I have 2
children, I never really knew how developed a 1st trimester baby was until I
saw the photos on the Abort73 website. The sheer brutality of the abortion
procedure violates my conscience & I simply cannot accept that it is perfectly
legal for a women to slaughter her own unborn child. I am extremely moved by

[Abort73] is Wonderful! As a mother of 2 boys with severe autism there are
many in the autism community that want to locate a detectable gene that can be
found on prenatal tests so parents can be informed of the likelihood of their
unborn child being autistic. This angers me because truly parents who chose to
abort these children have no idea of the love and beauty that can be found
through a child effected by autism. Its a disorder...not a death sentence.

I hadn't cared before because I hadn't SEEN abortion. I'd seen poverty,
starvation, slavery, persecution, but I'd never seen abortion. That video has

continue a pregnancy is a very private one and up to the woman who is
pregnant, and the father of the baby if he is involved. You should not impose

thing, some of the kids told me, was when I read about the abortion

I agree with everything that Abort73 stands for. Abortion hurts me so deeply.
I am 19 and just gave birth to my son six months ago. I look at him and I see
a perfectly formed human being and my heart just aches when I think about my
"choice" to have killed him. I never even considered it an option but so many
do, because it's "the easy way out". But it's not the easy way, it's the
hardest. One of my best friends, who is very pro-choice once said to me, "I
love my right to choose. I don't want the governments hands on my body." But
the government already has it's hands on her body by legalizing abortion,
convincing her that it's okay to murder her own child. Abortion is murder.
There shouldn't have to be a "choice". Your website is a beautiful testament
to life.

just discovered your web site while searching for material to use in my ethics
class... It is excellent for attracting our youth today. I will be referring
students to your site and will also inform our pro life student organization
about your site and your work. The T shirts are very fine... Excellent
arguments and use of the embryology. Excellent on displaying suction curetage
abortion...

[Abort73] made me realize how there are many different aspects to the pro-life
movement. Educating others, actively serving women, personal education,
influencing politics etc are all ways to express and act on this movement.
Your website serves to educate and inspire others. Its a GREAT resource!!!!

I knew some of the facts behind abortion, but this website does the best job
I've ever seen of laying out the scientific, moral, and theological reasons to
support protection for the unborn. Most other sites would be dismissed as
"antiabortion propaganda" by the pro-abortion faction, but you can't argue
with the facts presented here.

I love your website and ministry. I just stumbled upon it shortly ago in
Wikipedia. I was updating my own website (www.beavoiceforthevoiceless.com ),
which focuses on approaching animal rights, human rights (including abortion),
and caring for the earth from a Christian perspective. Basically, a Consistent
Life Ethic that respect all of God's creation. I have had the site for going
on a year now, and had a hard time finding a good pro-life movement to
endorse. I find that the popular ones are run by what seems to be an older
generation, that is very mad, in-your-face, and alienating to the very people
they're trying to reach out to. I have always wanted to get involved in the
pro-life movement, and feel I finally found an organization I can be proud to
endorse... I like the fresh, approachable feel of your website and ministry.
Please let me know how I can get involved.

Abort73.com is what first opened my eyes to abortion. I've been raised to know
that it's wrong... I know now that women and girls get abortions out of fear,
selfishness, or, worse yet, ignorance. Because they honestly don't know.
Nobody ever taught them it was wrong... I thank Abort73 for spreading the
word, and working to end the ignorance. If by wearing a shirt, getting a
bumper sticker, or posting a video to my Facebook, I can save someone from
death, I'll do it!!

I watched 2 of the videos on [your] website - the banner looked so cool I just
couldn't resist. At first I was rolling my eyes because I thought it was just
some swanky site to change my opinion on abortion. Well, I watched the videos
and it really opened my eyes to things that people fail to mention elsewhere
when talking about abortion. I now look at things differently, and believe
that abortion is actually what it sounds like. To abort. I cried when seeing

As a Christian in college, I have to deal with abortion issues in classroom
and personal settings. With numerous websites, it has become difficult to
separate fact from fiction when looking for resources. However, Abort73 offers
an easily navigable website, with interesting and accurate information. It
addresses most every issue that arises in pro-life vs. pro-choice discussions
and defenses. I highly recommend this website to anyone wanting to better
educate themselves on the facts of abortion. Abort73 provides a plethora of
useful resources to help anyone become active in speaking for the unborn
children. As a result, I can take a stand, knowing that I do so with solid
facts. This website has greatly inspired and aided my desire and duty to take
action against abortion. I strongly hope and pray that the recommendation of
this site to others will yield the same results.

I had always been one of those people who just said that it was the woman's
choice. If she can sleep at night about it, then that's her life. I visited
this website because I was writing a paper about [abortion], and I was letting
my mother proof-read it afterwords, and she broke down. She told me that
before me, she had an abortion. She told me that there was not a day that went
by that she didn't think about her baby and regretted it. Seeing that
firsthand I now see that most women don't really know what they are going to
do and if they did that they would never do it. Your website is out there with
the truth, no sugarcoating and I think its awesome because it shows abortion
for what it really is... murder.

I've actually gone back and forth over the years over whether I was pro-choice
or not. I think I've always settled with the feeling that although abortion
was not for me, I had no right to push my opinions on someone else, since none
of us walk in the same shoes... But now I feel that instead of killing that
precious little one, there need to be multiple choices a woman or girl can
find, very easily, to give her a choice besides abortion. Your website offers
rational, non-judgmental answers to some very real questions about whether or
not an abortion is the solution a woman should seek in the case of an
accidental pregnancy.

keeps me from feeling so sick. I felt so horrible today, as if this thing
growing inside me was just taking my life force from me to live, and yet I
don't even want it... Anyways, after I read these testimonies and watched the

I love how your main goal isn't merely to make abortion illegal but it's to
change the way people think-to affect the lives of the girls who struggle with
whether to get an abortion or not. It makes much more sense to educate people

The truth is, I was raised baptist, but I did everything I wasnt supposed to
do. So technically I have been pro-life for a long time without even giving it
real consideration. I have had an abortion, and I was so distant from God at
the time I just asked "why me?" God was trying to teach my a lesson. I have
learned that lesson, which brought me to your website. I want to do anything
and everything I can to stop this from happening. I think what you guys are
doing here is great. I completely support it and I have plans on sharing my
testimony. It's just a matter of working up the nerve. God uses our deepest,

Before seeing this website I was never undecided on whether abortion was
right, or wrong. In the eyes of my God, it is wrong, and in my eyes it can
never be right, but sometimes, I thought abortion may be accepted, some people
may be doing the 'right thing' and making a 'better choice'. I'm a med student
in the UK, in my second year of university. Abortion is a topic which is not
widely studied in the medical profession, only by those who choose to
specialize in gynecology, or related medical fields. And no where in any
medical text book that Oxford has thrown at us does it show such images of
abortion and the apparent reckless damage it inflicts upon the foetus. I thank
you very much for giving me a chance to see how these extremely young lives
are ended... you're doing an amazing thing allowing people to see how cruel
the worlds most evolutionary species can be.

I had an abortion years ago and had never dealt with forgiving myself, asking
for forgiveness/salvation. It has taken me almost 20 years to get to that
point. This site along with the one I was on when I found you, has prompted me
to be more involved in the pro-life movement. I have been involved on the
sidelines but will step it up. I am a mother now of three girls and I want to
make sure they are fully aware of what abortion is and won't believe or take
in the lies that I did.

Pictures and stories from people who have gone through this shows the true
damage this has on everyone involved. Because I was young and uneducated, I
suffered an abortion when I was only 14. Upon educating myself, I was
desperate to let everyone know the truth. I'd been searching so long for
something like this. Something to help me speak out as loud as possible and
help people understand the harsh reality of this matter!! I stand 100% behind

I never realized exactly how an abortion was achieved. I always thought that
the baby was sucked out through a tube and it was painless for both the baby
and the mother. I also didn't realize that a baby could be terminated so late
into pregnancy (the last image on the video). I thought anything more than
about 12 weeks would not be allowed. Because I do remember hearing that if a
premature baby is 22 weeks old or more the doctors are meant to try and save
it, and yet it is ok to kill a 22, 23 or 24 week old baby?! I always thought
it was wrong to abort a more developed baby, but now I know how old some
babies actually are when they are aborted.

that every day this happens and yet nobody does anything about it. I cried

came across videos, information on techniques performed, and so on, and I was
astonished. It's truly a devastation and makes me stomach churn in agony to

My whole life I've always said that abortion is ok. I've always thought that
if a woman gets raped and gets pregnant that abortion would be the way to go.
But now, after looking at these pictures, I don't believe that anymore. I
don't see how a person could kill a 22 week old baby. The baby has little
hands and little feet and can feel and it can smell with its little nose. It's
not a fully developed person yet, but it is a person... I appreciate these
pictures being on the web to see. I think that if more people looked at them,
it would change their mind about abortion.

I recently bought a pink "guns" shirt, and whenever I wear it, people STARE at
it! I've never gotten that reaction from anything else. I know the message is
strong, and it needs to be--perhaps being more direct makes people actually
think about what's happening in an abortion. Especially when we read news like
that from NJ yesterday. Apparently telling women that the fetus is "nothing
but blood" and minimizing the fact that it is a developing person is OK with
the courts there. It's frightening! Someone from NJ needs to send the judges
"guns" shirts, too. Make them think. Thanks for what you do!

what would happen if i got pregnant at this time I thought the only thing that
would be okay for me and the guy I was involvoed with would be abortion. I

it is. Innocent lives are being taken everyday and nobody is doing anything to
stop it. You can murder someone and get put in jail for it but you can take an
unborn baby's life and get away with it? It doesn't make a whole lot of sense

and have a 3 year old. I love her so much as any mum would. She was not
planned either. But I look at her and cry sometimes, knowing I've stopped
someone being born... Why is it when you're young, people give you one side to
the story? If I had known how big my baby was at the time, and had an
ultrasound etc, I really feel this would have changed my mind. But this isn't
what every around me wanted me to hear...

At first, I was taught that it was okay to have abortions. People always told
me when I asked that the baby has no sense until three months of age. That's
why we kill the baby before... This site influenced my thinking more. The
people who believe/had abortions were born. Basicaly its lazy birth control...

This website really educated me on a lot of things I didn't know, and the
pictures of unborn children really set the reality of how wrong [abortion] is,
because before I knew the facts I never knew that fetuses were babies, and
that they weren't just tissue because no one ever took the time to tell me
otherwise**, but now I know and understand how damaging abortion can be, not
just to the baby, but the mother too!

This web site changed my way of thinking** by seeing the tiny babies being
torn apart and their tiny heads crushed... I always thought anyone could do
what they wanted with their body, it's theirs to do what they want to, but I
really think God knows more than we do... with all the free clinics in the
world today giving out birth control of all types there is no reason why a
women of any age should be getting pregnant, even teenagers can get condoms
from the health departments and free clinics that offer the free AIDS and STD
test... why don't you girls and women out there start using birth control and
stop using abortion for birth control?

I have encountered so many people who thought abortion was just about removing
tissue. I used to be one of them. Then one day someone handed me a pamphlet
with a picture of an aborted fetus and I was so shocked to find out that
abortion is NOT the removal of tissue. It is actually the killing of a living
human being. If it weren't for people like you who tell the truth about
abortion, I would've continued to support it AND probably had one myself. Is
it really giving a woman a choice if you're not telling her the truth about
what her choices are? I can't understand how it's legal for abortion clinics
to provide abortions without it being mandatory for them to show #1 an
ultrasound of their baby, and #2 a demonstration and/or a video of the
abortion method. How is it that "a medical procedure," as pro-choicers like to
call it, is performed without adequately informing women what they are doing?
Isn't that lying? I have 2 children and am on the WIC program (Women Infant
Children) They give free education and vouchers for food for families and one
of their rules is that you MUST watch a video about breast-feeding before you
can receive your vouchers. When I get a medical exam, everything that is going
to be done to me is explained in detail and I am given information packets on
the procedure with pictures and everything. Smokers are told the risks of
smoking and even shown pictures of cancerous lungs so that they know exactly
what it is they're doing. The point is, it is normally REQUIRED to tell and
show someone exactly what they are doing before they do it. Yet it is not the
same with abortion. I don't get that. If I hadn't seen a picture of an aborted
child that was handed to me by a pro-lifer, I might've gotten an abortion
thinking that what I was doing was simply removing a lifeless lump. By
withholding information from me, I wasn't given an opportunity to make a real
choice. By withholding information, I was being deceived. Pro-choice people
are actually Anti-choice because they won't show pictures of aborted fetuses.
They hide the truth from people who WOULDN'T get an abortion if they had only
known what the truth was. I thank people like you who DO show these pictures
and educate people on what abortion really is. If it wasn't for people like
you, I might've been deceived by society into killing my baby. Keep up the
good work.

what they believe, I direct them here. I tell them, if they're pro choice,
then what do they have to lose? It will either give them insight into the
argument against abortion so that they can better argue their side, or, what I
truly believe will happen, it will change their mind. If the person is pro

should be illegal. Only 11 voted. 9 voted that abortion should be legal and 2
that it should be illegal. After that I ordered the Abortion Unfiltered DVD
from you guys. I showed it to them and 8 voted that abortion should be illegal

When I first found this website I was doing a debate project for school on
abortions. I used so much of the sites' information and won the debate. I
remember that I couldn't show the videos to my classmates because they were
graphic but many of them went on this site to see for themselves and ended up
in tears, even the guys. Many of the kids in that class who used to be pro-
choice switched to pro-life after they heard my debate and saw the videos. I
would like to thank everyone who put their time into this website. I will
never EVER consider an abortion and I will never let anyone I know get one

To begin I must thank you for the truth-filled informative and compassionate
ministry of Abort73.com... I've had with numerous conversations (8 so far)
with people about the meaning of "Abortion Unfiltered" and the meaning of
"Abort73." Each of those ended in providing a solid (thanks to your ministry
website) case for the full humanity of the unborn. Two of those cases resulted
in recently pregnant teens aborting their previous decision to abort their
unborn babies! Thank you again for standing amidst the crowds of our
uninformed culture and providing the truth on abortion in a gracious, even-

abortion... I guess I always thought it didn't really matter either way, even
though I have been raised with the belief that God knows a child from the
womb. I think that your site is absolutely amazing. I feel that it is an
extremely important cause, and I'm glad that you took the time to put it
together. The doctors tried to convince my mother to have an abortion when she
was pregnant with my older brother. They said he would be retarded... Well, my

from the ones a sister may see. Anyway, just a note to say I think you rock!

I took a pregnancy test, which came back positive. At the time, I was

requested that listeners go to this web site. Just out of curiosity, I came
here. I have always been pro-choice and couldn't believe that the Governor of
SD wants to outlaw all abortions. I have always been completely against
partial firth abortions though, and always thought that a woman should do it
in the first trimester. After seeing the photos, I am in shock! I am 28 years
old, with 2 children, a 2-year-old and 9-year-old. My mother was trying to
terrify me, and pressure me into getting an abortion when I was 18. Instead, I
chose to move out and be on my own. Call me ignorant, but I, like many others,
thought that a baby in the first trimester was like the size of a cell, too
little to even see. Well, that's what the pictures have always looked like in
the doc's offices! I am sitting here now, a changed woman... The images of
those tiny little babies will stay with me forever. Why aren't mothers shown
these things while waiting at the office to get their abortions? I could go on

I would like to thank the people that started this site, abort73.com. It is
the first place I have found accurate and I believe, real, photographic images
of aborted fetuses anywhere. Ever... I must thank you for not proliferating
completely specious arguments, though I wish those who are pro-life would come
to realize that not all people believe in the western God. As a pro-choice
woman, I must comment again and thank you for the accurate and real images you
have of aborted fetuses: I worked in a clinic. I have seen every aspect of the
process. I have had an abortion myself, and don't regret it. And I feel that
more and more pro-choice women should have to reckon with the realism of what
they are doing. I will be forwarding this to all of the women that I know, so
that we all can see this aspect of the choices that we make. It is real. And
we must be willing to take responsibility.

I never really thought about what abortion really was. I thought it was just a
way for kids who got pregnant too young. Now, seeing that video, I realized
you're killing a living breathing thing, and you don't have to. This video is
a great way for people to see what they are really doing when they get an
abortion.

In public schools we are taught so much about rights, and fairness...we are
even taught about sex. I was never sure if it was fair to tell a woman what
she could or could not do with her body... After seeing these images, I know
now, my stand. I am pro-life, not pro-abortion. I will refuse to even mention
it as "pro-choice" any longer, if this debate ever comes up. Public schools
feel we are mature enough for many different topics; but showing images of
abortion reality, they do not think we can handle? Let them have shown the guy
and girls what happens to unwanted to babies, what abortion really is. You
want to really get people to wear protection ! They will - because this is
visible, and tears at your very soul. Why is this even a " choice"? And of
course it is a life; if it was not, there would be NOTHING to abort!

I have always been pro-life, but I have never understood why. Abort73.com has
helped me to realize why I believe abortion is wrong. The website has an
extensive amount of information available that was extremely helpful to me in
determining why I believe what I do. I feel more prepared to defend my beliefs
as a result of visiting this website.

[This website] has impacted me in such a way that I am going to do a project
at my school to see if I can change the mind of others to believe that pro-
life is a better life. I will look at things in a whole new perspective on
this subject and all around life. Thank you for your time and money that you
have put into this website to uncover the truth about abortion. Even though
I'm only 13 I believe that I can impact other peoples live in many different
ways. THANK-YOU VERY MUCH!!!

Abort73 has really changed my opinion about abortion. I used to be pro-
abortion, but now I'm pro-life. This website has really put me in the know
about abortion, and how cruel and wrong it is.

I've seen pictures from other sites that did change my opinion from pro-choice
to pro-life. I used think that if a woman was raped and ended up pregnant she
should have the choice of whether or not to carry the child. I don't know why
I used to think that, I was young and immature I suppose, but the content on
this site solidifies my belief that abortion is murder.

I just wanted to take the time to tell you how moved I was by what I just
read. Honestly, I never sat down and thought about this situation and in my
English class I was assigned a paper on the argument of abortion. After
looking over this website I am just speechless. There are so many teens that
don't know any of this stuff and it should be in their studies in high
school... I cant wait to turn in my paper now. You guys did an awesome job
putting this together. I hope this will change many peoples mind.

I just wanted to say THANK YOU to whomever it is that wrote The Bible and
Unborn Life. I have been battling for two weeks about getting an abortion. I
prayed to God for an answer, and found this website tonight. You have helped
me understand God's view on unborn babies, and I have decided against an
abortion. Thank you again for your words, they are truly helpful and
uplifting. Although I have a very narrow path ahead of me, I am inspired to
know that there are people out there who still have morals and believe the
same as me. I found your website very informative, and wanted you to know how
truly instrumental you all are for making this website. Thanks again.

I have never seen such an immensely powerful site, just before I went on your
site I prayed that God would teach me to understand why I am pro-life, I
prayed for His answer and He gave it to me. There is no turning back now, I
have truly realized that World War III is here yet it is silent,and takes
lives in the womb. How could we not fight against abortion? My heart aches.

I don't know if I agree with you completely but after seeing that disturbing
video I am more on your side then before. I am 17 years old and I have a son
that is 14 months old and I would never ever get an abortion. I think that it
is wrong, but I think that if a woman is raped she should be able to get an
abortion because it wasn't her fault, but if you make a mistake and weren't
careful then you should deal with it and keep the baby. I am happy that you
guys provide such good information that the girls that get abortions all the
time should really see and know about.

I was not even wanting to go to this web site and I saw the video that you
have come on when you first came to the page. I want to thank you for letting
me see about abortion. I have had two or three friends that have had an
abortion... I always thought that was for them and that might be the best
thing for them at their age. Today, I see a whole different side of the
problem and I know that if I bring a child in this world that I am going to
think about this video before I ever have an abortion. I think you should send
this around to all the schools and let every kid watch it.......maybe they
well think about it first.

I used to think that if you don't want [a baby] and the guy doesn't want it,
get rid of it, but now that I watched your video I'm am totally against
[abortion].... Just seeing all those innocent little babies was like "Oh my
god what kind of monster could do that to that innocent child?"... [Now], I am
totally for a law banning abortions.

I've always been pro-choice...why would a 12 year old girl who's been raped be
forced to keep a child that she will despise for the rest of her life? I
sympathized with people who had abortions because I felt it was necessary in
some cases. Your website and your video has completely changed my mind.My
mother was forced to abort a child before my sister and I (by my father), and
I can now understand why she has so much anger and why she's so messed up...
I've made some bad choices in life and slept around, out of spite for my
parents, knowing that if I were ever to get pregnant I would abort... Until
today, I still believed that if I were to get pregnant I could just abort and
my parents would never know. But I don't think I could ever live with the pain
of knowing I had given up my fiance's child. I love him so much and I don't
care what my parents will think. What if I can't be blessed by God again "when
I'm ready"? My mother's abortion messed up our family. I am not willing to do
the same for mine. Thank you for letting me understand.

I am THRILLED....I have not seen anything like this ever before. I have to
confess that I had an abortion a month ago and I was in the 5th week, this is
why I am trying to find more information on this issue, because I really want
to hear all arguments and I am really starting to change my mind. Although I
am most probably never going to become an extreme pro-lifer, now I am
convinced that abortion should be illegal in most cases, with few EXCEPTIONS.

I feel empowered and confident after reading through your website. I haven't

logical and not overly religious, which is where I think a lot of people get
lost (the "I'm not religious, so 'your' morals don't apply to me"). Fabulous
website. Your design is fantastic -- user-friendly and compelling.

Atlanta, Ga. in 1996 and am just now coming to terms with that. I've been to
many pro-life sites but this one is by and far THE BEST I've ever seen. I am

This is one of the best pro-life websites I have seen. The videos do what
everyone is afraid to do, show EXACTLY what is happening. In order to argue
the case properly, things like this HAVE to be done. Show the pro-choice
people what they are doing through their 'choice'. The cases were argued very
well and really opened a few of my friends eyes who I had not already opened
before (the video in particular). Thank you sooooo much for helping my friends
see the light, 3 of them are strong pro-lifers now. Thanks again.

This web site was mind blowing... the video was very striking and very sick..
I think that this video should be shown to every high school student in the
united states... this video would!definitely hit them hard and force them to
think about what the real consequence are when you have unprotected sex and
the end result. I don't think that teenagers now a days think about the
abortion issue until it is too late.

This website has shown me that abortion is simply the murder of innocent
children. I always thought that getting rid of a child because he or she was
unwanted was horrible, but I always used to think about rape victims and
forced pregnancy. However, I have since realized that one wrong deed does not
justify another.

I'm a 23 year old mother of one and soon to be a mother of two... I have had
TWO abortions and I have yet to overcome them emotionally... [Coming to
Abort73.com] is the first time I have challenged the suggestion of abortion,
the first time (regrettably) I have actually taken time to think about it
before making a decision...This is ALL happening for a reason. Everything will
fall into place... I am having this baby and no clinic is going to stop me.

I have an unplanned pregnancy & my partner had put lot of pressure on me to
have an abortion. I have never really had an opinion on abortion but always
knew in my heart that if the situation arose, I couldn't do it. I went along
to [the abortion clinic] anyway just so I could say that I had looked at it
from all angles & that he couldn't say I didn't look at it from his point of
view. When I walked through the door I knew instantly that no way was I going
to abort this little baby. I still went through with the whole discussion &
they made it out to be a simple procedure. I came home & looked up abortion on
the internet & saw all the horrific pictures & I honestly couldn't believe it.
Surely these abortion clinics should be brutally honest & show these pictures
rather than make out that all you're having is similar to a bikini wax!!!! I
cried so much when I saw the pictures & was even more shocked at the partial
birth abortions...I didn't know they existed (call me naive but I
didn't!!!)... I am so relieved that I have made the right decision to keep my
baby & that I stood up to the pressure of people. I have printed pictures off
the website to show my partner so he can look at it realistically and not just
shove it to the back of his mind. I am 11 weeks and when I saw those little
fingers and feet etc in the video the tears rolled down in sorrow at the loss
of those poor beautiful innocents. The final scene was horrific & I looked at
that baby & thought how could someone do that?? I will never know how the
human race works.

I was a lost and confused 15 year old... I thought I was pregnant and
considered my options. Abortion seemed a fair enough option as no one would
ever know (especially my parents). I saw my friend wearing a shirt that said
"Abort73". I didn't ask her about it, but I was curious what it was about.
Later when I got home I visited the site - after 5 minutes my jaw dropped and
I realized just how horrible abortion was. Thank you abort73! I am convinced.

and I am 3 months pregnant now. Since I have found out about the pregnancy I
have been happy, but recently that feeling has changed. After viewing the

because it is exactly what you guys say it is, its murder.

abortion: it is murder and the worst form of child abuse.

I figured that the women had the right to choose since it was her body and
that if she didn't want to be a mother then she could abort if she wanted to.

They said it was the pictures that did it. Thank you.
