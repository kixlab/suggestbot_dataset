_Know the facts, connect with resources, andget one-on-one support to help you
address known or suspected LSD use with your child._

**What are some slang terms for LSD?**  
Acid, Blotter, Cheer, Dots, Hit, Mellow Yellow, L, Lucy, Tabs, Window Pane,
Yellow Sunshine, Blue Heaven, Microdot, Cubes

**What is LSD?**  
LSD (D-lysergic acid diethylamide) is the most common hallucinogen, a group of
drugs that alter awareness of perception, thoughts and feelings. It is one of
the most powerful mood-changing chemicals. It is made from lysergic acid,
which is found in ergot, a fungus that grows on rye and other grains. 1

**What does LSD look like?**  
LSD is sold on the street in tablets, capsules and occasionally in liquid
form. It is a clear or white odorless substance with a slightly bitter taste.
LSD is often added to absorbent paper, such as “blotter” paper -- paper that
is divided into small decorated squares (or “tabs”), with each square
representing one dose called a “hit.” The squares may be colored or have
images printed on them. Liquid LSD is clear, and is usually sold in a small
container, tube or flask. LSD can also be found in thin squares of gelatin.

**How is LSD used?**  
LSD is taken orally. Gelatin and liquid can be put in the eyes. 1

**What do people hear about LSD?**  
Teens and young adults may hear that LSD will “expand their mind” or give them
a carefree, euphoric feeling.

**What are the risks of LSD use?**  
The effects of LSD are unpredictable and occur based on factors such as on the
amount taken, a person’s personality, mood, expectations and the surroundings
in which the drug is used. The ability to make sound judgments and see common
dangers is impaired, leading to a risk of injury.

In some people, LSD can cause flashbacks, recurrence of certain drug
experiences even if the user doesn’t take the drug again. In some people,
flashbacks can persist and affect daily functioning, a condition known as
hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder (HPPD).

LSD does produce tolerance, so some people who take the drug repeatedly must
take higher doses to achieve the same effect. This is an extremely dangerous
practice, given the unpredictability of the drug. In addition, LSD produces
tolerance to other hallucinogens, including psilocybin.2

**What are some signs of LSD use?**

  * Dilated pupils
  * Higher body temperature
  * Increased heart rate and blood pressure
  * Excessive Sweating
  * Loss of appetite
  * Nausea
  * Sleep problems
  * Dry mouth
  * Tremors
  * Uncoordinated movements
  * Panic
  * Paranoia
  * Psychosis
