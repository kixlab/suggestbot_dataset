Component statistic of the United States Gross Domestic Product

The **personal consumption expenditure** ( **PCE** ) measure is the component
statistic for consumption in gross domestic product (GDP) collected by the
United States Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). It consists of the actual and
imputed expenditures of households and includes data pertaining to durable and
non-durable goods and services. It is essentially a measure of goods and
services targeted towards individuals and consumed by individuals.[1]

The **PCE price index** ( **PCEPI** ), also referred to as the **PCE
deflator** , **PCE price deflator** , or the **Implicit Price Deflator for
Personal Consumption Expenditures** ( **IPD** for **PCE** ) by the BEA, and as
the **Chain-type Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures** (
**CTPIPCE** ) by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is a United States-
wide indicator of the average increase in prices for all domestic personal
consumption. It is benchmarked to a base of 2009 = 100. Using a variety of
data including U.S. Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index prices, it
is derived from the largest component of the GDP in the BEA's National Income
and Product Accounts, personal consumption expenditures.

The less volatile measure of the PCE price index is the **core PCE** (
**CPCE** ) price index which excludes the more volatile and seasonal food and
energy prices.

In comparison to the headline United States Consumer Price Index (CPI), which
uses one set of expenditure weights for several years, this index uses a
Fisher Price Index, which uses expenditure data from the current period and
the preceding period. Also, the PCEPI uses a chained index which compares one
quarter's price to the previous quarter's instead of choosing a fixed base.
This price index method assumes that the consumer has made allowances for
changes in relative prices. That is to say, they have substituted from goods
whose prices are rising to goods whose prices are stable or falling.

PCE has been tracked since January 1959. Through July 2018, inflation measured
by PCE has averaged 3.3%, while it has averaged 3.8% using CPI.[2] This may be
due to the failure of CPI to take into account the substitution effect.
Alternatively, an unpublished report on this difference by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics suggests that most of it is from different ways of calculating
hospital expenses and airfares.[3]

## Federal Reserve[edit]

In its "Monetary Policy Report to the Congress" ("Humphrey–Hawkins Report")
from February 17, 2000 the FOMC said it was changing its primary measure of
inflation from the consumer price index to the "chain-type price index for
personal consumption expenditures".[4]

## Comparison to CPI[edit]

The differences between the two indexes can be grouped into four categories:
formula effect, weight effect, scope effect, and "other effects".

  * The formula effect accounts for the different formulas used to calculate the two indexes. The PCE price index is based on the Fisher-Ideal formula, while the CPI is based on a modified Laspeyres formula.
  * The weight effect accounts for the relative importance of the underlying commodities reflected in the construction of the two indexes.
  * The scope effect accounts for conceptual differences between the two indexes. PCE measures spending by and on behalf of the personal sector, which includes both households and nonprofit institutions serving households; the CPI measures out-of-pocket spending by households. The "net" scope effect adjusts for CPI items out-of-scope of the PCE price index less items in the PCE price index that are out-of-scope of the CPI.
  * "Other effects" include seasonal adjustment differences, price differences, and residual differences.[5][ _dead link_ ]

The above chart is illustrative but may not reflect current values. The
comparisons in the table above will vary over time as the relative weights of
the components of the indexes change. The CPI base price and weightings are
adjusted every two years.

The above table illustrates two commonly discussed important differences
between the PCE deflator and CPI-U. The first is the relative importance of
housing, which is due in part to the difference in scope mentioned above. CPI
contains a large component of owner-equivalent rent, which by definition is an
imputed value and not a real direct expenditure. The second major difference
in weight is healthcare. This again stems from the definition of the index and
the surveys used. CPI measures only the out-of-pocket healthcare costs of
households where PCE includes healthcare purchased on behalf of households by
third parties, including employer-provided health insurance. In the United
States, employer health insurance is a large component and accounts for much
of the difference in weights.

Another notable difference is CPI prices and weightings are based on household
surveys and PCE is based on business surveys. One reason for the difference in
formulas is that not all the data needed for the Fisher-Ideal formula is
available monthly even though it is considered superior. CPI is a practical
alternative used to give a quicker read on prices in the previous month. PCE
is typically revised three times in each of the months following the end of a
quarter, and then the entire NIPA tables are re-based annually and every five
years. Despite all these conceptual and methodological differences, the two
indexes track fairly closely when averaged over several years.[7]
