>> **Climate change** occurs when changes in Earth's climate system result in
new weather patterns that last for at least a few decades, and maybe for
millions of years. The climate system is comprised of five interacting parts,
the atmosphere (air), hydrosphere (water), cryosphere (ice and permafrost),
biosphere (living things), and lithosphere (earth's crust and upper mantle).
The climate system receives nearly all of its energy from the sun, with a
relatively tiny amount from earth's interior. The climate system also gives
off energy to outer space. The balance of incoming and outgoing energy, and
the passage of the energy through the climate system, determines Earth's
energy budget. When the incoming energy is greater than the outgoing energy,
earth's energy budget is positive and the climate system is warming. If more
energy goes out, the energy budget is negative and earth experiences cooling.

>>

>> As this energy moves through Earth's climate system, it creates Earth's
weather and long-term averages of weather are called "climate". Changes in the
long term average are called "climate change". Such changes can be the result
of "internal variability", when natural processes inherent to the various
parts of the climate system alter Earth's energy budget. Examples include
cyclical ocean patterns such as the well-known El Niño–Southern Oscillation
and less familiar Pacific decadal oscillation and Atlantic multidecadal
oscillation. Climate change can also result from "external forcing", when
events outside of the climate system's five parts nonetheless produce changes
within the system. Examples include changes in solar output and volcanism.

>>

>> Human activities can also change earth's climate, and are presently driving
climate change through global warming.[1] There is no general agreement in
scientific, media or policy documents as to the precise term to be used to
refer to anthropogenic forced change; either "global warming" or "climate
change" may be used.[2]

>>

>> The field of climatology incorporates many disparate fields of research.
For ancient periods of climate change, researchers rely on evidence preserved
in climate proxies, such as ice cores,[3] ancient tree rings, geologic records
of changes in sea level, and glacial geology. Physical evidence of current
climate change covers many independent lines of evidence, a few of which are
temperature records, the disappearance of ice, and extreme weather events.

>> ## Terminology

>>

>> The most general definition of climate change is a change in the
statistical properties (principally its mean and spread)[4] of the climate
system when considered over long periods of time, regardless of cause.[5]
Accordingly, fluctuations over periods shorter than a few decades, such as El
Niño, do not represent climate change.

>>

>> The term "climate change" is often used to refer specifically to
anthropogenic climate change (also known as global warming). Anthropogenic
climate change is caused by human activity, as opposed to changes in climate
that may have resulted as part of Earth's natural processes.[6] In this sense,
especially in the context of environmental policy, the term climate change has
become synonymous with anthropogenic global warming. Within scientific
journals, global warming refers to surface temperature increases while climate
change includes global warming and everything else that increasing greenhouse
gas levels affect.[7]

>>

>> A related term, "climatic change", was proposed by the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) in 1966 to encompass all forms of climatic variability on
time-scales longer than 10 years, but regardless of cause. During the 1970s,
the term climate change replaced climatic change to focus on anthropogenic
causes, as it became clear that human activities had a potential to
drastically alter the climate.[2] Climate change was incorporated in the title
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Climate change is now used as both a
technical description of the process, as well as a noun used to describe the
problem.[2]

>> Earth's climate is largely determined by the planet's energy budget, _i.e._
, the balance of incoming and outgoing radiation. It is measured by satellites
and shown in W/m².[8]

>>

>> Prior to the 18th century, scientists had not suspected that prehistoric
climates were different from the modern period. By the late 18th century,
geologists found evidence of a succession of geological ages with changes in
climate. In the years since, a great deal of scientific progress has been made
understanding the workings of the climate system.[ _citation needed_ ]

>> ## Causes of climate change

>>

>> See also: Attribution of recent climate change

>>

>> On the broadest scale, the rate at which energy is received from the Sun
and the rate at which it is lost to space determine the equilibrium
temperature and climate of Earth. This energy is distributed around the globe
by winds, ocean currents,[9][10] and other mechanisms to affect the climates
of different regions.[11]

>>

>> Factors that can shape climate are called climate forcings or "forcing
mechanisms".[12] These include processes such as variations in solar
radiation, variations in the Earth's orbit, variations in the albedo or
reflectivity of the continents, atmosphere, and oceans, mountain-building and
continental drift and changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. There are a
variety of climate change feedbacks that can either amplify or diminish the
initial forcing. Some parts of the climate system, such as the oceans and ice
caps, respond more slowly in reaction to climate forcings, while others
respond more quickly. There are also key threshold factors which when exceeded
can produce rapid change.

>>

>> Forcing mechanisms can be either "internal" or "external". Internal forcing
mechanisms are natural processes within the climate system itself (e.g., the
thermohaline circulation). External forcing mechanisms can be either
anthropogenic (e.g. increased emissions of greenhouse gases and dust) or
natural (e.g., changes in solar output, the earth's orbit, volcano eruptions).

>>

>> Whether the initial forcing mechanism is internal or external, the response
of the climate system might be fast (e.g., a sudden cooling due to airborne
volcanic ash reflecting sunlight), slow (e.g. thermal expansion of warming
ocean water), or a combination (e.g., sudden loss of albedo in the Arctic
Ocean as sea ice melts, followed by more gradual thermal expansion of the
water). Therefore, the climate system can respond abruptly, but the full
response to forcing mechanisms might not be fully developed for centuries or
even longer.

>>

>> ### Internal forcing mechanisms

>>

>> Scientists generally define the five components of earth's climate system
to include atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere (restricted to the
surface soils, rocks, and sediments), and biosphere.[13] Natural changes in
the climate system ("internal forcings") result in internal "climate
variability".[14] Examples include the type and distribution of species, and
changes in ocean-atmosphere circulations.

>> Pacific decadal oscillation 1925 to 2010

>>

>> The ocean and atmosphere can work together to spontaneously generate
internal climate variability that can persist for years to decades at a
time.[15][16] Examples of this type of variability include the El
Niño–Southern Oscillation, the Pacific decadal oscillation, and the Atlantic
Multidecadal Oscillation. These variations can affect global average surface
temperature by redistributing heat between the deep ocean and the
atmosphere[17][18] and/or by altering the cloud/water vapor/sea ice
distribution which can affect the total energy budget of the earth.[19][20]

>>

>> The oceanic aspects of these circulations can generate variability on
centennial timescales due to the ocean having hundreds of times more mass than
in the atmosphere, and thus very high thermal inertia. For example,
alterations to ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation play a key
role in redistributing heat in the world's oceans. Due to the long timescales
of this circulation, ocean temperature at depth is still adjusting to effects
of the Little Ice Age[21] which occurred between the 1600 and 1800s.

through such mechanisms as albedo, evapotranspiration, cloud formation, and
weathering.[22][23][24] Examples of how life may have affected past climate

>> In the context of climate variation, anthropogenic factors are human
activities which affect the climate. The scientific consensus on climate
change is "that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part
caused by human activities",[35] and it "is largely irreversible".[36]

>>

>>> ... there is a strong, credible body of evidence, based on multiple lines
of research, documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are
in large part caused by human activities. While much remains to be learned,
the core phenomenon, scientific questions, and hypotheses have been examined
thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and
careful evaluation of alternative explanations.

>>>

>>> — United States National Research Council, _Advancing the Science of
Climate Change_

>>

>> Of most concern in these anthropogenic factors is the increase in CO2
levels. This is due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion, followed by
aerosols (particulate matter in the atmosphere), and the CO2 released by
cement manufacture.[37] Other factors, including land use, ozone depletion,
animal husbandry (ruminant animals such as cattle produce methane,[38] as do
termites), and deforestation, are also of concern in the roles they play—both
separately and in conjunction with other factors—in affecting climate,
microclimate, and measures of climate variables.[39]

>>

>> #### Orbital variations

>>

>> Main article: Milankovitch cycles

>>

>> Slight variations in Earth's motion lead to changes in the seasonal
distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and how it is
distributed across the globe. There is very little change to the area-averaged
annually averaged sunshine; but there can be strong changes in the
geographical and seasonal distribution. The three types of kinematic change
are variations in Earth's eccentricity, changes in the tilt angle of Earth's
axis of rotation, and precession of Earth's axis. Combined together, these
produce Milankovitch cycles which affect climate and are notable for their
correlation to glacial and interglacial periods,[40] their correlation with
the advance and retreat of the Sahara,[40] and for their appearance in the
stratigraphic record.[41][42]

>>

>> The IPCC notes that Milankovitch cycles drove the ice age cycles, CO2
followed temperature change "with a lag of some hundreds of years", and that
as a feedback amplified temperature change.[43] The depths of the ocean have a
lag time in changing temperature (thermal inertia on such scale). Upon
seawater temperature change, the solubility of CO2 in the oceans changed, as
well as other factors affecting air-sea CO2 exchange.[44]

>>

>> Variations in solar activity during the last several centuries based on
observations of sunspots and beryllium isotopes. The period of extraordinarily
few sunspots in the late 17th century was the Maunder minimum.

>>

>> The Sun is the predominant source of energy input to the Earth. Other
sources include geothermal energy from the Earth's core, tidal energy from the
Moon and heat from the decay of radioactive compounds. Both long- and short-
term variations in solar intensity are known to affect global climate.

>>

>> Three to four billion years ago, the Sun emitted only 75% as much power as
it does today.[45] If the atmospheric composition had been the same as today,
liquid water should not have existed on Earth. However, there is evidence for
the presence of water on the early Earth, in the Hadean[46][47] and
Archean[48][46] eons, leading to what is known as the faint young Sun
paradox.[49] Hypothesized solutions to this paradox include a vastly different
atmosphere, with much higher concentrations of greenhouse gases than currently
exist.[50] Over the following approximately 4 billion years, the energy output
of the Sun increased and atmospheric composition changed. The Great
Oxygenation Event—oxygenation of the atmosphere around 2.4 billion years
ago—was the most notable alteration. Over the next five billion years from the
present, the Sun's ultimate death as it becomes a red giant and then a white
dwarf will have large effects on climate, with the red giant phase possibly
ending any life on Earth that survives until that time.[51]

>> Solar activity events recorded in radiocarbon. Values since 1950 not shown.

>>

>> Solar output varies on shorter time scales, including the 11-year solar
cycle[52] and longer-term modulations.[53] Solar intensity variations,
possibly as a result of the Wolf, Spörer, and the Maunder Minima, are
considered to have been influential in triggering the Little Ice Age.[54] This
event extended from 1550 to 1850 AD and was marked by relative cooling and
greater glacier extent than the centuries before and afterward.[55][56] Solar
variation may also have affected some of the warming observed from 1900 to
1950. The cyclical nature of the Sun's energy output is not yet fully
understood; it differs from the very slow change that is happening within the
Sun as it ages and evolves.

>>

>> Some studies point toward solar radiation increases from cyclical sunspot
activity affecting global warming, and climate may be influenced by the sum of
all effects (solar variation, anthropogenic radiative forcings, etc.).[57][58]

>>

>> A 2010 study suggests "that the effects of solar variability on temperature
throughout the atmosphere may be contrary to current expectations".[59]

>>

>> In 2011, CERN announced the initial results from its CLOUD experiment in
the _Nature_ journal.[60] The results indicate that ionisation from cosmic
rays significantly enhances aerosol formation in the presence of sulfuric acid
and water, but in the lower atmosphere where ammonia is also required, this is
insufficient to account for aerosol formation and additional trace vapours
must be involved. The next step is to find more about these trace vapours,
including whether they are of natural or human origin.

>>

>> In atmospheric temperature from 1979 to 2010, determined by MSU NASA
satellites, effects appear from aerosols released by major volcanic eruptions
(El Chichón and Pinatubo). El Niño is a separate event, from ocean
variability.

>>

>> The eruptions considered to be large enough to affect the Earth's climate
on a scale of more than 1 year are the ones that inject over 100,000 tons of
SO2 into the stratosphere.[61] This is due to the optical properties of SO2
and sulfate aerosols, which strongly absorb or scatter solar radiation,
creating a global layer of sulfuric acid haze.[62] On average, such eruptions
occur several times per century, and cause cooling (by partially blocking the
transmission of solar radiation to the Earth's surface) for a period of
several years.

>>

>> The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, the second largest terrestrial
eruption of the 20th century, affected the climate substantially, subsequently
global temperatures decreased by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) for up to three
years.[63][64] Thus, the cooling over large parts of the Earth reduced surface
temperatures in 1991–93, the equivalent to a reduction in net radiation of 4
watts per square meter.[65] The Mount Tambora eruption in 1815 caused the Year
Without a Summer.[66] Much larger eruptions, known as large igneous provinces,
occur only a few times every fifty – one hundred million years – through flood
basalt, and caused in Earth past global warming and mass extinctions.[67]

>>

>> Small eruptions, with injections of less than 0.1 Mt of sulfur dioxide into
the stratosphere, affect the atmosphere only subtly, as temperature changes
are comparable with natural variability. However, because smaller eruptions
occur at a much higher frequency, they too significantly affect Earth's
atmosphere.[61][68]

>>

>> Seismic monitoring maps current and future trends in volcanic activities,
and tries to develop early warning systems. In climate modelling the aim is to
study the physical mechanisms and feedbacks of volcanic forcing.[69]

>>

>> Volcanoes are also part of the extended carbon cycle. Over very long
(geological) time periods, they release carbon dioxide from the Earth's crust
and mantle, counteracting the uptake by sedimentary rocks and other geological
carbon dioxide sinks. The US Geological Survey estimates are that volcanic
emissions are at a much lower level than the effects of current human
activities, which generate 100–300 times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted
by volcanoes.[70] A review of published studies indicates that annual volcanic
emissions of carbon dioxide, including amounts released from mid-ocean ridges,
volcanic arcs, and hot spot volcanoes, are only the equivalent of 3 to 5 days
of human-caused output. The annual amount put out by human activities may be
greater than the amount released by supererruptions, the most recent of which
was the Toba eruption in Indonesia 74,000 years ago.[71]

>>

>> Although volcanoes are technically part of the lithosphere, which itself is
part of the climate system, the IPCC explicitly defines volcanism as an
external forcing agent.[72]

>>

>> #### Plate tectonics

>>

>> Main article: Plate tectonics

>>

>> Over the course of millions of years, the motion of tectonic plates
reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topography. This can
affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphere-ocean
circulation.[73]

>>

>> The position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and
therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation. The locations of the seas
are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the
globe, and therefore, in determining global climate. A recent example of
tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the Isthmus of
Panama about 5 million years ago, which shut off direct mixing between the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This strongly affected the ocean dynamics of what
is now the Gulf Stream and may have led to Northern Hemisphere ice
cover.[74][75] During the Carboniferous period, about 300 to 360 million years
ago, plate tectonics may have triggered large-scale storage of carbon and
increased glaciation.[76] Geologic evidence points to a "megamonsoonal"
circulation pattern during the time of the supercontinent Pangaea, and climate
modeling suggests that the existence of the supercontinent was conducive to
the establishment of monsoons.[77]

>>

>> The size of continents is also important. Because of the stabilizing effect
of the oceans on temperature, yearly temperature variations are generally
lower in coastal areas than they are inland. A larger supercontinent will
therefore have more area in which climate is strongly seasonal than will
several smaller continents or islands.

>>

>> The Earth receives an influx of ionized particles known as cosmic rays from
a variety of external sources, including the Sun. A hypothesis holds that an
increase in the cosmic ray flux would increase the ionization in the
atmosphere, leading to greater cloud cover. This, in turn, would tend to cool
the surface. The non-solar cosmic ray flux may vary as a result of a nearby
supernova event, the solar system passing through a dense interstellar cloud,
or the oscillatory movement of the Sun's position with respect to the galactic
plane. The latter can increase the flux of high-energy cosmic rays coming from
the Virgo cluster.[78]

>>

>> Evidence exists that the Chicxulub impact some 66 million years ago had
severely affected the Earth's climate. Large quantities of sulfate aerosols
were kicked up into the atmosphere, decreasing global temperatures by up to 26
°C and producing sub-freezing temperatures for a period of 3–16 years. The
recovery time for this event took more than 30 years.[79]

>>

>> ## Study of past climates

>>

>> A number of disciplines throw light on past climates.

>>

>> Paleoclimatology is the study of changes in climate taken on the scale of
the entire history of Earth. It uses a variety of proxy methods from the Earth
and life sciences to obtain data previously preserved within things such as
rocks, sediments, ice sheets, tree rings, corals, shells, and microfossils. It
then uses the records to determine the past states of the Earth's various
climate regions and its atmospheric system. Notable climate events known to
paleoclimatology are provided in this list of periods and events in climate
history.

>>

>> Historical climatology is the study of historical changes in climate and
their effect on human history and development. The primary sources include
written records such as sagas, chronicles, maps and local history literature
as well as pictorial representations such as paintings, drawings and even rock
art.

>>

>> Climate change in the recent past may be detected by corresponding changes
in settlement and agricultural patterns.[80] Archaeological evidence, oral
history and historical documents can offer insights into past changes in the
climate. Climate change effects have been linked to the rise[81] and also the
collapse of various civilizations.[80]

>> Arctic temperature anomalies over a 100-year period as estimated by NASA.
Typical high monthly variance can be seen, while longer-term averages
highlight trends.

>>

>> Evidence for climatic change is taken from a variety of sources that can be
used to reconstruct past climates. Reasonably complete global records of
surface temperature are available beginning from the mid-late 19th century.
For earlier periods, most of the evidence is indirect—climatic changes are
inferred from changes in proxies, indicators that reflect climate, such as
vegetation, ice cores,[3] dendrochronology, sea level change, and glacial
geology.

>>

>> ### Temperature (surface and oceans)

>>

>> The instrumental temperature record from surface stations was supplemented
by radiosonde balloons, extensive atmospheric monitoring by the mid-20th
century, and, from the 1970s on, with global satellite data as well. Taking
the record as a whole, most of the 20th century had been unprecedentedly warm,
while the 19th and 17th centuries were quite cool.[83]

>>

>> The 18O/16O ratio in calcite and ice core samples used to deduce ocean
temperature in the distant past is an example of a temperature proxy method,
as are other climate metrics noted in subsequent categories.

>>

>> ### Glaciers

>>

>> Glaciers are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate
change.[84] Their size is determined by a mass balance between snow input and
melt output. As temperatures warm, glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation
increases to make up for the additional melt; the converse is also true.

>>

>> Glaciers grow and shrink due both to natural variability and external
forcings. Variability in temperature, precipitation, and englacial and
subglacial hydrology can strongly determine the evolution of a glacier in a
particular season. Therefore, one must average over a decadal or longer time-
scale and/or over many individual glaciers to smooth out the local short-term
variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climate.

>>

>> A world glacier inventory has been compiled since the 1970s, initially
based mainly on aerial photographs and maps but now relying more on
satellites. This compilation tracks more than 100,000 glaciers covering a
total area of approximately 240,000 km², and preliminary estimates indicate
that the remaining ice cover is around 445,000 km². The World Glacier
Monitoring Service collects data annually on glacier retreat and glacier mass
balance. From this data, glaciers worldwide have been found to be shrinking
significantly, with strong glacier retreats in the 1940s, stable or growing
conditions during the 1920s and 1970s, and again retreating from the mid-1980s
to the present.[85][86]

>>

>> The most significant climate processes since the middle to late Pliocene
(approximately 3 million years ago) are the glacial and interglacial cycles.
The present interglacial period (the Holocene) has lasted about 11,700
years.[87] Shaped by orbital variations, responses such as the rise and fall
of continental ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the
climate. Other changes, including Heinrich events, Dansgaard–Oeschger events
and the Younger Dryas, however, illustrate how glacial variations may also
influence climate without the orbital forcing.

>>

>> Glaciers leave behind moraines that contain a wealth of material—including
organic matter, quartz, and potassium that may be dated—recording the periods
in which a glacier advanced and retreated. Similarly, by tephrochronological
techniques, the lack of glacier cover can be identified by the presence of
soil or volcanic tephra horizons whose date of deposit may also be
ascertained.

>>

>> Data from NASA's Grace satellites show that the land ice sheets in both
Antarctica (upper chart) and Greenland (lower) have been losing mass since
2002. Both ice sheets have seen an acceleration of ice mass loss since
2009.[88]

>>

>> ### Arctic sea ice decline

>>

>> Main articles: Arctic sea ice decline and Climate change in the Arctic

>>

>> The decline in Arctic sea ice, both in extent and thickness, over the last
several decades is further evidence for rapid climate change.[89] Sea ice is
frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface. It covers millions of square
kilometers in the polar regions, varying with the seasons. In the Arctic, some
sea ice remains year after year, whereas almost all Southern Ocean or
Antarctic sea ice melts away and reforms annually. Satellite observations show
that Arctic sea ice is now declining at a rate of 13.2 percent per decade,
relative to the 1981 to 2010 average.[90] The 2007 Arctic summer sea ice
retreat was unprecedented. Decades of shrinking and thinning in a warm climate
has put the Arctic sea ice in a precarious position, it is now vulnerable to
atmospheric anomalies.[91] "Both extent and volume anomaly fluctuate little
from January to July and then decrease steeply in August and September".[91]
This decrease is because of lessened ice production as a result of the
unusually high SAT. During the Arctic summer, a slower rate of sea ice
production is the same as a faster rate of sea ice melting.

>> The estimated change in sea level caused by carbon dioxide emissions.

>>

>> Global sea level change for much of the last century has generally been
estimated using tide gauge measurements collated over long periods of time to
give a long-term average. More recently, altimeter measurements—in combination
with accurately determined satellite orbits—have provided an improved
measurement of global sea level change.[92] To measure sea levels prior to
instrumental measurements, scientists have dated coral reefs that grow near
the surface of the ocean, coastal sediments, marine terraces, ooids in
limestones, and nearshore archaeological remains. The predominant dating
methods used are uranium series and radiocarbon, with cosmogenic radionuclides
being sometimes used to date terraces that have experienced relative sea level
fall. In the early Pliocene, global temperatures were 1–2˚C warmer than the
present temperature, yet sea level was 15–25 meters higher than
today.[93][94][95]

>>

>> According to recent studies, global-mean sea level rose by 195 mm during
the period from 1870 to 2004.[96] Since 2004, satellite-based records indicate
that there has been a further 43 mm of global-mean sea levels rise, as of July
2017[update].[97]

>>

>> ### Ice cores

>>

>> The Antarctic temperature changes during the last several glacial and
interglacial cycles of the present ice age, according to δ18O ratios.

>>

>> Analysis of ice in a core drilled from an ice sheet such as the Antarctic
ice sheet, can be used to show a link between temperature and global sea level
variations. The air trapped in bubbles in the ice can also reveal the CO2
variations of the atmosphere from the distant past, well before modern
environmental influences. The study of these ice cores has been a significant
indicator of the changes in CO2 over many millennia, and continues to provide
valuable information about the differences between ancient and modern
atmospheric conditions.

>>

>> ### Cloud cover and precipitation

>>

>> See also: Cloud and Precipitation

>>

>> Past precipitation can be estimated in the modern era with the global
network of precipitation gauges. Surface coverage over oceans and remote areas
is relatively sparse, but, reducing reliance on interpolation, satellite
clouds and precipitation data has been available since the 1970s.[98]
Quantification of climatological variation of precipitation in prior centuries
and epochs is less complete but approximated using proxies such as marine
sediments, ice cores, cave stalagmites, and tree rings.[99] In July 2016
scientists published evidence of increased cloud cover over polar
regions,[100] as predicted by climate models.[101]

>>

>> Climatological temperatures substantially affect cloud cover and
precipitation. For instance, during the Last Glacial Maximum of 18,000 years
ago, thermal-driven evaporation from the oceans onto continental landmasses
was low, causing large areas of extreme desert, including polar deserts (cold
but with low rates of cloud cover and precipitation).[102] In contrast, the
world's climate was cloudier and wetter than today near the start of the warm
Atlantic Period of 8000 years ago.[102]

>>

>> Estimated global land precipitation increased by approximately 2% over the
course of the 20th century, though the calculated trend varies if different
time endpoints are chosen, complicated by ENSO and other oscillations,
including greater global land cloud cover precipitation in the 1950s and 1970s
than the later 1980s and 1990s despite the positive trend over the century
overall.[98][103][104] Similar slight overall increase in global river runoff
and in average soil moisture has been perceived.[103]

>>

>> ### Vegetation

>>

>> A change in the type, distribution and coverage of vegetation may occur
given a change in the climate. Some changes in climate may result in increased
precipitation and warmth, resulting in improved plant growth and the
subsequent sequestration of airborne CO2. The effects are expected to affect
the rate of many natural cycles like plant litter decomposition rates.[105] A
gradual increase in warmth in a region will lead to earlier flowering and
fruiting times, driving a change in the timing of life cycles of dependent
organisms. Conversely, cold will cause plant bio-cycles to lag.[106] Larger,
faster or more radical changes, however, may result in vegetation stress,
rapid plant loss and desertification in certain circumstances.[107][108] An
example of this occurred during the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse (CRC),
an extinction event 300 million years ago. At this time vast rainforests
covered the equatorial region of Europe and America. Climate change devastated
these tropical rainforests, abruptly fragmenting the habitat into isolated
'islands' and causing the extinction of many plant and animal species.[107]
Such stress can alter the growth rate of trees, which allows scientists to
infer climate trends by analyzing the growth rate of tree rings. This branch
of climate science is called dendroclimatology, and is one of the many ways
they research climate trends prior to written records.[109]

>>

>> #### Forest genetic resources

>>

>> Even though this is a field with many uncertainties, it is expected that
over the next 50 years climate changes will have an effect on the diversity of
forest genetic resources and thereby on the distribution of forest tree
species and the composition of forests. Diversity of forest genetic resources
enables the potential for a species (or a population) to adapt to climatic
changes and related future challenges such as temperature changes, drought,
pests, diseases and forest fire. However, species are not naturally capable to
adapt in the pace of which the climate is changing and the increasing
temperatures will most likely facilitate the spread of pests and diseases,
creating an additional threat to forest trees and their populations.[110] To
inhibit these problems human interventions, such as transfer of forest
reproductive material, may be needed.[111]

>>

>> #### Pollen analysis

>>

>> Palynology is the study of contemporary and fossil palynomorphs, including
pollen. Palynology is used to infer the geographical distribution of plant
species, which vary under different climate conditions. Different groups of
plants have pollen with distinctive shapes and surface textures, and since the
outer surface of pollen is composed of a very resilient material, they resist
decay. Changes in the type of pollen found in different layers of sediment in
lakes, bogs, or river deltas indicate changes in plant communities. These
changes are often a sign of a changing climate.[112][113] As an example,
palynological studies have been used to track changing vegetation patterns
throughout the Quaternary glaciations[114] and especially since the last
glacial maximum.[115]

>> ### Animals

>>

>> Remains of beetles are common in freshwater and land sediments. Different
species of beetles tend to be found under different climatic conditions. Given
the extensive lineage of beetles whose genetic makeup has not altered
significantly over the millennia, knowledge of the present climatic range of
the different species, and the age of the sediments in which remains are
found, past climatic conditions may be inferred.[116] The studies of the
impact in vertebrates are few mainly from developing countries, where there
are the fewest studies; between 1970 and 2012, vertebrates declined by 58
percent, with freshwater, marine, and terrestrial populations declining by 81,
36, and 35 percent, respectively.[117]

>>

>> Similarly, the historical abundance of various fish species has been found
to have a substantial relationship with observed climatic conditions.[118]
Changes in the primary productivity of autotrophs in the oceans can affect
marine food webs.[119]

>>

>> ### Human impacts

>>

>> According to the IPCC, human-caused global warming is driving climate
changes impacting both human and natural systems on all continents and across
the oceans. Human-caused global warming results from the increased use of
fossil fuels in transportation, manufacturing and communications. Internet
induced climate change is newest contributor to human-induced climate
change.[120] Some of the impacts include the altering of ecosystems (with a
few extinctions), threat to food production and water supplies due to extreme
weather, and the dislocation of human communities due to sea level rise and
other climate factors. Taken together these hazards also exacerbate other
stressors such as poverty.[121] Possible societal responses include efforts to
prevent additional climate change, adapting to unavoidable climate change, and
possible future climate engineering.

conclusions or theories have been so thoroughly examined and tested, and
supported by so many independent observations and results, that their
likelihood of subsequently being found to be wrong is vanishingly small. Such
conclusions and theories are then regarded as settled facts. This is the case
for the conclusions that the Earth system is warming and that much of this
