        1. a) A parasite is defined as an organism of _one_ species living in or on an organism of _another_ species (a heterospecific relationship) and deriving its nourishment from the host (is metabolically dependent on the host). (See Cheng, T.C., _General Parasitology_ , p. 7, 1973.)
    

b) A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species ( _Homo sapiens_ )
living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the _same_ species ( _Homo
sapiens_ ) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically
dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory
dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship.

    
        2. a) A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an _outside_ source.
    

b) A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming
from an _inside_ source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it
moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the
first cell of the new human being.

    
        3. a) A parasite is _generally harmful_ to some degree to the host that is harboring the parasite.
    

b) A human embryo or fetus developing in the uterine cavity _does not usually
cause harm_ to the mother, although it may if proper nutrition and care is not
maintained by the mother.

    
        4. a) A parasite makes _direct_ contact with the host's tissues, often holding on by either mouth parts, hooks or suckers to the tissues involved (intestinal lining, lungs, connective tissue, etc.).
    

b) A human embryo or fetus makes direct contact with the uterine lining of the
mother for only a short period of time. It soon becomes isolated inside its
own amniotic sac, and from that point on makes _indirect_ contact with the
mother only by way of the umbilical cord and placenta.

    
        5. a) When a parasite invades host tissue, the host tissue will sometimes respond by forming a capsule (of connective tissue) to surround the parasite and _cut it off_ from other surrounding tissue (examples would be _Paragonimus westermani_ , lung fluke, or _Oncocerca volvulus_ , a nematode worm causing cutaneous filariasis in the human).
    

b) When the human embryo or fetus attaches to and invades the lining tissue of
the mother's uterus, the lining tissue responds by surrounding the human
embryo and _does not cut it off_ from the mother, but rather establishes a
means of close contact (the placenta) between the mother and the new human
being.

    
        6. a) When a parasite invades a host, the host _will usually respond_ by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host. (See Cheng, T.C., _General Parasitology_ , p. 8.)
    

b) New evidence, presented by Beer and Billingham in their article, "The
Embryo as a Transplant" ( _Scientific American_ , April, 1974), indicates that
the mother does react to the presence of the embryo by producing humoral
antibodies, but they suggest that the trophoblast -- the jacket of cells
surrounding the embryo -- blocks the action of these antibodies and therefore
the embryo or fetus is not rejected. This reaction is unique to the embryo-
mother relationship.

    
        7. a) A parasite is generally detrimental to the reproductive capacity of the invaded host. The host may be weakened, diseased or killed by the parasite, thus reducing or eliminating the host's capacity to reproduce.
    

b) A human embryo or fetus is absolutely essential to the reproductive
capacity of the involved mother (and species). The mother is usually not
weakened, diseased or killed by the presence of the embryo or fetus, but
rather is fully tolerant of this offspring which _must_ begin his or her life
in this intimate and highly specialized relationship with the mother.

    
        8. a) A parasite is an organism that, once it invades the definitive host, will usually remain with host for life (as long as it or the host survives).
    

b) A human embryo or fetus has a temporary association with the mother,
remaining only a number of months in the uterus.

A parasite is an organism that associates with the host in a negative,
unhealthy and nonessential (nonessential to the host) manner which will often
damage the host and detrimentally affect the procreative capacity of the host
(and species).

A human embryo or fetus is a human being that associates with the mother in a
positive, healthful essential manner necessary for the procreation of the
species.

_Note:_ When some people claim preborn children are parasites, they mean
"parasite" in its pejorative, that is, in its social-ethical sense. Prof.
Johnson's article addresses only the biological meaning of "parasite."
Libertarians for Life responds to the pejorative sense in other articles.
Briefly, as libertarians, we strongly agree that women as well as men have the
right to control their own bodies. Nonetheless, we hold that under principles
of individual liberty, parents have the obligation to support their dependent
children. Our children have a _right_ to our support, whether they are in the
crib or in the womb.

| LFL explains and defends the libertarian case against abortion choice. Our
reasoning is expressly scientific and philosophical rather than either
pragmatic or religious, or merely political or emotional.
