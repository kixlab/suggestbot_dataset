>> # Can animals and plants adapt to global warming?

>>

>> Link to this page

>>

>> ## What the science says...

>>

>> A large number of ancient mass extinction events have been strongly linked
to global climate change. Because current climate change is so rapid, the way
species typically adapt (eg - migration) is, in most cases, simply not be
possible. Global change is simply too pervasive and occurring too rapidly.

>>

>> ## Climate Myth...

>>

>> Animals and plants can adapt  
>  [C]orals, trees, birds, mammals, and butterflies are adapting well to the
routine reality of changing climate." (source: Hudson Institute)

>>

>> Humans are transforming the global environment. Great swathes of temperate
forest in Europe, Asia and North America have been cleared over the past few
centuries for agriculture, timber and urban development. Tropical forests are
now on the front line. Human-assisted species invasions of pests, competitors
and predators are rising exponentially, and over-exploitation of fisheries,
and forest animals for bush meat, to the point of collapse, continues to be
the rule rather than the exception.

>>

>> Driving this has been a six-fold expansion of the human population since
1800 and a 50-fold increase in the size of the global economy. The great
modern human enterprise was built on exploitation of the natural environment.
Today, up to 83% of the Earth's land area is under direct human influence and
we entirely dominate 36% of the bioproductive surface. Up to half the world's
freshwater runoff is now captured for human use. More nitrogen is now
converted into reactive forms by industry than all by all the planet's natural
processes and our industrial and agricultural processes are causing a
continual build-up of long-lived greenhouse gases to levels unprecedented in
at least the last 800,000 years and possibly much longer.

>>

>> Clearly, this planet-wide domination by human society will have
implications for biological diversity. Indeed, a recent review on the topic,
the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment report (an environmental report of
similar scale to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment
Reports), drew some bleak conclusions - 60% of the world's ecosystems are now
degraded and the extinction rate is now 100 to 1000 times higher than the
"background" rate of long spans of geological time. For instance, a study I
conducted in 2003 showed that up to 42% of species in the Southeast Asian
region could be consigned to extinction by the year 2100 due to deforestation
and habitat fragmentation alone.

> Figure 1: Southeast Asian extinctions projected due to habitat loss (source:
Sodhi, N. S., Koh, L. P., Brook, B. W. & Ng, P. K. L. 2004)_

>>

>> Given these existing pressures and upheavals, it is a reasonable question
to ask whether global warming will make any further meaningful contribution to
this mess. Some, such as the sceptics S. Fred Singer and Dennis Avery, see no
danger at all, maintaining that a warmer planet will be beneficial for mankind
and other species on the planet and that "corals, trees, birds, mammals, and
butterflies are adapting well to the routine reality of changing climate".
Also, although climate change is a concern for conservation biologists, it is
not the focus for most researchers (at present), largely I think because of
the severity and immediacy of the damage caused by other threats.

>>

>> Global warming to date has certainly affected species' geographical
distributional ranges and the timing of breeding, migration, flowering, and so
on. But extrapolating these observed impacts to predictions of future
extinction risk is challenging. The most well known study to date, by a team
from the UK, estimated that 18 and 35% of plant and animal species will be
committed to extinction by 2050 due to climate change. This study, which used
a simple approach of estimating changes in species geographical ranges after
fitting to current bioclimatic conditions, caused a flurry of debate. Some
argued that it was overly optimistic or too uncertain because it left out most
ecological detail, while others said it was possibly overly pessimistic, based
on what we know from species responses and apparent resilience to previous
climate change in the fossil record - see below.

>>

>> A large number of ancient mass extinction events have indeed been strongly
linked to global climate change, including the most sweeping die-off that
ended the Palaeozoic Era, 250 million years ago and the somewhat less
cataclysmic, but still damaging, Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, 55 million
years ago. Yet in the more recent past, during the Quaternary glacial cycles
spanning the last million years, there were apparently few climate-related
extinctions. This curious paradox of few ice age extinctions even has a name -
it is called 'the Quaternary Conundrum'.

>>

>> Over that time, the globally averaged temperature difference between the
depth of an ice age and a warm interglacial period was 4 to 6°C - comparable
to that predicted for the coming century due to anthropogenic global warming
under the fossil-fuel-intensive, business-as-usual scenario. Most species
appear to have persisted across these multiple glacial-interglacial cycles.
This can be inferred from the fossil record, and from genetic evidence in
modern species. In Europe and North America, populations shifted ranges
southwards as the great northern hemisphere ice sheets advanced, and reinvaded
northern realms when the glaciers retreated. Some species may have also
persisted in locally favourable regions that were otherwise isolated within
the tundra and ice-strewn landscapes. In Australia, a recently discovered cave
site has shown that large-bodied mammals ('megafauna') were able to persist
even in the arid landscape of the Nullarbor in conditions similar to now.

>>

>> However, although the geological record is essential for understanding how
species respond to natural climate change, there are a number of reasons why
future impacts on biodiversity will be particularly severe:

>>

>> A) Human-induced warming is already rapid and is expected to further
accelerate. The IPCC storyline scenarios such as A1FI and A2 imply a rate of
warming of 0.2 to 0.6°C per decade. By comparison, the average change from 15
to 7 thousand years ago was ~0.005°C per decade, although this was
occasionally punctuated by short-lived (and possibly regional-scale) abrupt
climatic jolts, such as the Younger Dryas, Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich
events.

>>

>> B) A low-range optimistic estimate of 2°C of 21st century warming will
shift the Earth's global mean surface temperature into conditions which have
not existed since the middle Pliocene, 3 million years ago. More than 4°C of
atmospheric heating will take the planet's climate back, within a century, to
the largely ice-free world that existed prior to about 35 million years ago.
The average 'species' lifetime' is only 1 to 3 million years. So it is quite
possible that in the comparative geological instant of a century, planetary
conditions will be transformed to a state unlike anything that most of the
world's modern species have encountered.

>>

>> C) As noted above, it is critical to understand that ecosystems in the 21st
century start from an already massively 'shifted baseline' and so have lost
resilience. Most habitats are already degraded and their populations depleted,
to a lesser or greater extent, by past human activities. For millennia our
impacts have been localised although often severe, but during the last few
centuries we have unleashed physical and biological transformations on a
global scale. In this context, synergies (positive or self-reinforcing
feedbacks) from global warming, ocean acidification, habitat loss, habitat
fragmentation, invasive species, chemical pollution (Figure 2) are likely lead
to cascading extinctions. For instance, over-harvest, habitat loss and changed
fire regimes will likely enhance the direct impacts of climate change and make
it difficult for species to move to undamaged areas or to maintain a 'buffer'
population size. One threat reinforces the other, or multiple impacts play off
on each other, which makes the overall impact far greater than if each
individual threats occurred in isolation (Brook et al 2008).

>>

>  _Figure 2: Figure from theMillennium Ecosystem Assessment_

>>

>> D) Past adaptation to climate change by species was mainly through shifting
their geographic range to higher or lower latitudes (depending on whether the
climate was warming or cooling), or up and down mountain slopes. There were
also evolutionary responses - individuals that were most tolerant to new
conditions survived and so made future generations more intrinsically
resilient. Now, because of points A to C described above, this type of
adaptation will, in most cases, simply not be possible or will be inadequate
to cope. Global change is simply too pervasive and occurring too rapidly.
Time's up and there is nowhere for species to run or hide.

A1FI and A2 imply a rate of warming of 0.2 to 0.6°C per decade." which just
has not happened but it does not change the message or impact of the article.
Kudos to Professor Barry Brook.

and especially the early post, Effects of Climate Change, where I give an
overview of my concerns. I see very prominent and deleterious effects on
vegetation around my home in NJ and I would be very interested to learn of
other observers who would be willing to compare notes.

>>

>> Why is this important? Because many of the prominent and influential policy
makers live on the Eastern Seaboard and maybe if they become enlightened
enough to recognize the collapse of the ecosystem around their own homes, they
might finally realize how urgent it is to eliminate carbon emissions.

practices, barely support an assortment of goats and lizards. Not a fruit tree
or a grain crop in sight. There are similar places elsewhere in the world.
Once lost, always lost.

>>

>> As for evolution taking care of the problem. Evolution for changed climate
consitions takes many generations - maybe centuries, maybe millennia, maybe
millions of years. The big difference for substantial impact on species this
time round is the lack of places to go. Even where human population is sparse,
the lands in question are surrounded by urban or agricultural developments
inimical to the free movement and re-establishment of existing or changing
species.

>>

>> Change _is_ natural - when it occurs on natural time-scales. This time
we're changing things in the space of a few human generations rather than a
few thousand or million years.

>> From MacKenzie and Schiedek 2007:  
>  _... trends in surface temperatures in the North and Baltic Seas now exceed
those at any time since instrumented measurements began in 1861 and 1880.
Temperatures in summer since 1985 have increased at nearly triple the global
warming rate which is expected to occur during the 21st century and summer
temperatures have risen 2-5 times faster than those in other seasons. These
warm temperatures and rates of change are due partly to an increase in the
frequency of extremely warm years. The **recent warming event is exceeding the
ability of local species to adapt** and is consequently leading to major
changes in the structure, function and services of these ecosystems._
[emphasis added]

>> From Devictor et al. 2008:  
>  _... a 91 km northward shift in bird community composition, which is much
higher than previous estimates based on changes in species range edges. During
the same period, temperature increase corresponds to a 273 km northward shift
in temperature. Change in community composition was thus insufficient to keep
up with temperature increase: birds are lagging approximately 182 km behind
climate warming._

however it certainly must be causing some problems for some of the modelers.

half of all models that are predicting a wetter trend, then they must also be
accepting that it also invalidates those other half of the models predicting a
drier trend which obviously have been built around some rather incorrect
assumptions.

greening over a significant area of the desert. It's a bit early to start
calling out specific models.

general by introducing a bit of FUD about their precision. However, as the
article clearly spells out, it is _North Africa_ that is difficult to model.
Models tend to agree a lot more about other regions, and there's no reason to
believe that the models that eventually get it wrong on North African impact
are any less accurate in the rest of their predictions.

of biodiversity and thus is every bit as worth addressing on that front as the
other problems you list... there are also several studies showing that rising
CO2 levels may further threaten the rainforests by increasing evaporation and
decreasing precipitation in the region. Thus, addressing CO2 emissions can
also help prevent further rainforest loss. That would also cause rainforest
recovery, but only if the land were allowed to revert.

>> CBDunkerson, I just wanted to point out that at the current time loss of
biodiversity is due to direct human intervention by far outranking that what
can be attributed to global warming. Chances that tropical rainforests are
threatened by it are rather slim as studies show that in the tropics
forestation is the main factor governing local weather patterns(i. e. they
show that deforestation leads to major changes in weather patterns). Some
small scale endeavours on the other hand show that rainforest farming (using
the biological productivity of rainforests to support the local population) is
a viable and sustainable alternative - capable not only to fight poverty but
even to allow for modest prosperity -, but they are not getting a chance due
to the profits that biological fuels are promising. So far I can only see that
in result the global warming theory has led to nothing but an increasing pace
of destroying the ability of this globe to support human life.

extinction 250 million years ago, because CO2 emissions from the Siberian
Traps warmed the atmosphere and oceans, causing the oceans to lose oxygen.
With less oxygen, the anaerobic bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide that spreads
through the ocean and into the atmosphere and poisons most of the animals on
the planet. When we hear about the potentially dire consequences of global
warming, why don't we ever hear about hydrogen sulfide emissions from the
warming oceans as a result of decreasing oxygen?

>> Following Scott Sinnock's (@34) advice, I searched Google Images for
"tertiary temperature". The most relevant, prominent image was this one
(originally from wikipedia):

>>

>> The data is from dO18 from foraminafora shells on the ocean floor. dO18
records both the ratio of fresh to salt water, and water temperature.
Consequently dO18 records do not linearly equate to temperature records
between different periods with very different ratios of fresh to salt water,
as when large quantities of ice are locked up in ice sheets. Hence the two
different temperature scales.

>>

>> As Stephen Baines mentions, the paper cited in the OP shows a temperature
record for the tertiary. Indeed, it shows the data in the image above, first
in an unmodified form and then adjusted for the size of ice sheets to give a
direct temperature measurement (Fig 3(b)):

>>

>> As you can see, temperatures did not consistently exceed 4 C above mid-
twentieth century values until 35 million years ago.

>>

>> Finally, I did see two images that showed temperatures in the 20 degree
range. One showed central european temperatures only, and hence was not
representative of global temperatures. The second was the crude graph by
Scotese which is (in its original form), not proxy based, but merely assigns a
warm temperature for periods without glaciation, and a cool temperature for
periods with extensive glaciation. It also showed global average temperatures
rather than the global temperature anomaly, and therefore showed at most a 7 C
increase over modern temperatures at any time in the tertiary. I do not know
what figure Scott Sinnock was basing his claims on, but they are not warranted
by the limited evidence he provides.

>> From clarification in #36, A global warming of 2 deg C is a low range
optimistic value and > 4 deg C of global warming by 2100 is a high range
estimate. >4 is ~1 deg per 20 years. We are 14 years into the 21st century.
What is the global temp increase from 2000 till now?

sea level is also 4419 mm above sea level. The recent trend along Fla coast
will bring sea water to the Jupiter Fla house doorstep in 1841 years, assuming
no changes in continental plate rise or fall over 1841 years. Sounding so many

>> MA Rodger @41, the current (day 142) sea ice extent according to Charctic
is 12.592 million km^2. That is 92.69% (or 93% after rounding) of the 1979
figure of 13.585 million km^2, but only 90.714% of 13.881 million km^2 on day
142 of 1985, ie, he actual record year for day 142 values. 1979 was the record
year for maximum ice extent, but not for maximum May extent.

>>

>> Jetfuel is very careful to not tell us that the current sea ice extent is
only 97.794% of the equivalent 2007 sea ice extent (12.876 million km^2), and
97.794% of the equivalent 2012 extent (12.876 million km^2). That there is
currently less ice than in the former, and current record September minimum
ice years, and that the former record minimim extent ice had more ice in day
142 than did the current record shows how pointless are the statistics jetfuel
is quoting.

>>

>> As jetfuel well knows if he has perused charctic, in May sea ice extent
variability is at a minimum. At this time of year, there is the least
difference between all years so that current values of sea ice extent provide
almost no predictive value in predicing eventual September minimums. It also
means that at this time of year there is a maximum ice melt for years with the
maximum March extent relative to other years - and it means nothing in terms
of determining how low the summer sea ice extent will be.

>>

>> This repeat and greatly extended series of such posts by jetfuel were he
takes data out of context and milks "skeptical" conclusions from them
regardless of their actual import (or lack of import). He does it so
consistently, and persistently in the face of correction that he is (IMO) not
entitled to the presumption of honest mistakes, and I am astonished that his
record of misinformation, sloganeering and repetition has not yet resulted in
his loosing the privilege of posting at SkS.

>>

>> Returning to the topic, polar bears are adapted to hunting on ice packs.
That makes them poor hunters on land, so that summer months are lean month
with many polar bears near starvation by the end of summer. The most immediate
threat from global warming to polar bears is from the extended duration before
they can return to the ice after summer due to the more extensive summer sea
ice melts. The slightly reduced sea ice extents in March are of almost no
consequence for polar bears, and also have no bearing on the critical summer
sea ice extent values.

>> Tom, Per my source Charctic, considerably less melting for this most recent
8 days (251,000 sq km) vs the same ~week in 1979 (415,000 sq km) could cause
ponderance to some. Thus, in warmer Arctic Ocean water, from a thinner ice
pack, and with 401 ppm CO2, ice is dissapearing slower than way back when
everything had warmed less. I was just noting that the ice area @time lines
were converging over that short time. Yes, that is a general trend for most
years. At least that part is behaving normal this year.

cannot understand (or probably refuse to understand="shenanigans") the
simplest use of scientific terms - in this case Area and Extent. The same
apprarent ignorance seems true for the effects of Arctic topology on the rate
of ice loss - it slows up as it retreats through the Bering Straits. Of
course, there comes a point when accumulative shenanigans become statistically
irrefutable.
