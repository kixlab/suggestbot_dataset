NASHVILLE, N.C. â€” Four of the five inmates who escaped from the Nash County
Detention center in North Carolina were in custody Tuesday morning.

Sheriff Keith Stone said the inmates forced through a hole in a fence in the
exercise yard at 3:30 p.m. on Monday and escaped, according to WRAL-TV. The
inmates were being monitored by a camera in the yard and Stone said it was
possible that they knew they were in a camera's blind spot.

The inmates are identified as David Marshal Viverette, 28, David Ruffin Jr.,
30, Keonte Daemoan Murphy, 23, Raheem D-Carlos Horne, 26, and Laquaris Rashad
Battle, 23, who remained at large Tuesday morning.

Viverette and Horne made it to Hal Orr's Inn in Rocky Mount, 15 miles away
from the Nashville jail. A tip led authorities to the motel, Stone said. Both
men were taken into custody on Monday night. It was not immediately known how
Ruffin and Murphy were apprehended.

The men's charges range from possession of a stolen vehicle to assault by
strangulation and drug possession.

Stone said the FBI and other area law enforcement departments have assisted in
the search. He urged residents to lock their homes and cars while the hunt
continues.
