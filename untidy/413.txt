Donald Trump earned 59 Four-Pinocchio ratings as a presidential candidate. Now
that he’s president, he has continued his proclivity for making dubious,
misleading or false statements. He also often repeats the same debunked claims
even though they have been fact-checked. It’s hard to keep up with all of
Trump’s rhetoric, so the Fact Checker is assembling in one place all of his
suspect statements from his first 100 days as president. You can sort them by
various categories and see how many times he has repeated the same false
statement.

[We’re tracking the progress of 60 pledges Trump made during his campaign —
and whether he achieved his goals.]

#### Where were the claims made?

The greatest number of false and misleading claims were made in remarks.

Trade

“The change began with the termination of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a
12-nation pact that would have shipped millions more jobs to other countries.”

Predicting job losses or gains from a trade agreement is fairly difficult and
often inaccurate but no credible analyst projected the loss of "millions" of
U.S. jobs from the TPP.

Trump now calls for Americans to “buy American, hire American.” But this is
misleading. Trump has a long history of outsourcing a variety of his own

products were manufactured (China, the Netherlands, Mexico, India, Turkey,
Slovenia, Honduras, Germany, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam and South Korea).

Trump’s attack on NAFTA is over the top. It is often difficult to separate out
the impact of trade agreements on jobs, compared to other, broader economic
trends. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2015 concluded
the “net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been
relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for
a small percentage of U.S. GDP,” though it noted “there were worker and firm
adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and
investment among their economies.”

Foreign policy

“Finally, NATO countries are starting to pay billions of dollars more since I
have made clear that the United States expects all of its allies to pay their

having defense spending account for two percent of each nation's gross
domestic product by 2024.

Fact Checker rating: Source: Statement

Trump takes undue credit for business decisions made prior to his election.
Ford’s decision to abandon its plans to open a factory in Mexico and instead
expand its Michigan plant has more to do with the company’s long-term goal —
particularly its plans to invest in electric vehicles — than with the
administration. Fiat Chrysler's plan to invest $1 billion for a factory in
Michigan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with
Trump. Japanese company SoftBank announced its $100 billion technology
investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a
narrow path to victory. Sprint said its hiring plan was a part of a commitment
by SoftBank, which owns a controlling stake in Sprint. And Intel announced it
would create at least 10,000 jobs at a “new” plant in Arizona. But Intel
actually announced a $5 billion investment in this factory in 2011 with then-
President Barack Obama.

Immigration

“After decades of unending illegal immigration and mass uncontrolled entry,
we’ve turned the tide as never before — illegal border-crossings are down 73
percent.”

Source: Statement

Trump is wrong to refer to "unending illegal immigration and mass uncontrolled
entry" as Illegal immigration has been declining in general for years. He
refers to the decline in apprehensions from December through March, which was
72 percent. Trump's rhetoric certainly has contributed to a decline in traffic
along the border, but it's unclear how long the trend will last.

This is an extreme estimate produced by opponents of the agreement.

Trade

“I have been talking about currency manipulation [by China] for a long time
but I have to tell you, during the election they stopped.”

Repeated on Apr. 21

Source: Prepared speech

Trump falsely claims China stopped devaluing its currency since he took
office. China had not devalued its currency for about two years prior to his
election. In fact, as recently as 10 days before his announcement that China
was not manipulating its currency, Trump falsely blamed China for being a
“world champion” of devaluing the yuan.

Jobs

“In just a few months we have created 99,000 new construction jobs, 49,000 new
manufacturing jobs, 27,000 new mining jobs….We have over 600,000 new jobs.”

Repeated on Apr. 11

Source: Prepared speech

Trump again is counting the January jobs report, even though that concerns
data for the period of Dec. 12 to Jan. 12, before he became president. So all
of these numbers are inflated. Moreover, even if you counting January jobs,
that brings the total to 533,000. The correct figure is 317,000. The other
corrected jobs numbers are: construction (65,000); manufacturing (37,000) and
mining (21,000). Obviously, a new president has little influence over broad
economic trends.

Immigration

“We have already achieved an unprecedented 73% reduction in illegal crossings
on our southern border.”

Trump refers to the decline in apprehensions from December through March,
which was 72 percent. Trump's rhetoric certainly has contributed to a decline
in traffic along the border, but it's unclear how long the trend will last.

Source: Prepared speech

Trump appears to be combining two disputed figures — 28,000 jobs for Keystone
XL and 12,000 for the Dakota Access Pipeline-- and then hyping it even more.
We have looked closely at the Keystone numbers, and the same methodological
issues appear to apply to the Dakota estimates. The actual number of Keystone
construction jobs, for instance, is just 3,900 on an annualized basis — and
other jobs have already been created (such as for building high-strength line
pipe.) In the context of the U.S. economy, which just in January added 230,000
jobs, these are not many jobs.

Economy

“We have the all-time record for the biggest increase in the stock market.”

Source: Prepared speech

The increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in Trump's first 100 days is
impressive -- a five percent gain. But George H.W. Bush had a 7.7 percent gain
in his first 100 days, so Trump does not have the record. Moreover, what
counts in the long run is the state of the economy at the end of a term, as
Bush (who lost re-election) could tell Trump.

The MS-13 gang far predates Obama, and has been active since the 1980s.
According to the Congressional Research Service in 2005 and 2008, the gang had
spread across the country since the 1980s. Moreover, the Immigration and
Customs Enforcement under Trump has been arresting an increasing number of
noncriminals, indicating that it's not just the gang members that are being
targeted by his administration.

Flynn had received a security clearance under Obama, but Obama also fired
Flynn from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Trump named
Flynn as his national security adviser, before firing him three weeks after he
took office, and the White House has not explained why his lobbying activities
had not received greater scrutiny before Trump elevated him to the such a top
security position.

Jon Ossoff, the Democrat Trump is referring to, supports a comprehensive
immigration bill that allows a "path to legal status" for undocumented people
(excluding felons) living in the country. But he also said he supports strong
border security. As PolitiFact found, this is not the same as "allowing
illegal immigration." On taxes, factcheck.org found that Ossoff has proposed
to simplify the tax code, and that “in order to lower tax rates, we can
eliminate carve-outs and special treatment in the tax code that privilege
large organizations at the expense of small businesses.”

Election

“The Republicans have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College, you
know that. Tremendous disadvantage.”

Repeated on Apr. 21

Source: Prepared speech

Trump certainly deserves credit for breaching the so-called “blue wall” – the
Midwestern states that have backed Democrats in recent years. But Republicans
have an advantage because they have an edge in small, rural states, which in
the electoral college system requires fewer votes per elector. In Wyoming, for
instance, there are 143,000 people for each electoral vote, compared to
500,000 in a state like California. Since Democrats tend to concentrated in
large cities, the impact of those votes are dissipated. This is one reason why
in two recent elections – 2000 and 2016 -- the Democrat won the popular vote
but lost the Electoral College.

Immigration

“But you need that wall to stop the human trafficking, to stop the drugs, to
stop the wrong people. You need the wall.”

Source: Prepared speech

There is little evidence that human trafficking takes place over the
U.S.-Mexican border. While human trafficking is a problem in some parts of the
world, experts say it is relatively limited in the United States, especially
for sexual exploitation. But in general data is limited on the extent of human
trafficking. As for drugs, that is also dubious. Experts say that drugs are
actually shipped through the border on the underside of vehicles that have
permits to cross the border in a special lane.

This is almost certainly a false statement, though because Trump failed to
disclose his tax returns that's difficult to verify. But just the elimination
of the alternative minimum tax -- which cost Trump $31 million in 2005 --
would be a huge savings for Trump. The New York Times estimated the proposed
tax plan would have saved Trump about $50 million in 2005.

Trade

“The trade deficit with Mexico is close to $70 billion. Even with Canada, it's

Trump is citing figures for trades in goods, but not including services. The
United States had a trade surplus of $12 billion with Canada and trade deficit
of $55 billion when services are included.

Economy

“We're the highest taxed nation in the world.”

Trump is simply wrong when he says the United States is the highest taxed
nation in the world. The Pew Research Center, using 2014 data, found that the
tax bill for Americans, under various scenarios, is below average for
developed countries. In 2014, according to comparative tables of the
Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), revenue as a
percentage of the gross domestic product — the broadest measure of the economy
— was 26 percent for the United States. Out of 34 countries, that put the
United States in the bottom third — and well below the OECD average of 34.4
percent.

There was never any polling indicating that Democrat Jon Ossoff was going to
get 56 percent of the vote in an open primary in Georgia's strongly Republican
6th Congressional District. There was a possibility he would get just over 50
percent, which would have eliminated a run-off election and been an
embarrassing loss for the GOP. Trump took credit for the Ossoff getting 48
percent, even though Republicans in the race distanced themselves from Trump

be in the country illegally. A handful of studies looked at whether there is a
causation between sanctuary cities and crime. They either found no
statistically significant impact of sanctuary policies on crime, or a
reduction in crime due to immigrant-friendly policing strategies.

Trump certainly deserves credit for breaching the so-called “blue wall” – the
Midwestern states that have backed Democrats in recent years. But Republicans
have an advantage because they have an edge in small, rural states, which in

instance, there are 143,000 people for each electoral vote, compared to
500,000 in a state like California. Since Democrats tend to concentrated in

“We will save perhaps $900 billion....I 'm saving a tremendous amount —
hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars we're saving on health care.”

Source: Interview

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office report on the Republican bill said
it would reduce the deficit by $337 billion over the next decade. Trump
appears to be referring to a $900 billion reduction in revenue from the repeal
of Obamacare taxes, but that’s actually money lost to the federal government.
The proposed law would have reduced federal spending on health care by $1.2
trillion but the repeal in taxes means the impact on the budget is
significantly smaller.

Trump suggests that he isn’t filling administration posts because of
Democratic obstruction. Democrats have slow-walked many of his cabinet
nominees, but Trump has been much slower than his predecessors in filling sub-
cabinet posts and other positions. Out of 553 key positions requiring Senate
confirmation, 478 still have no nominee, according to the Partnership for
Public Service. Another 29 have been announced but not formally nominated;
only 22 positions have been confirmed. Republican senators have said they are
growing impatient with the White House’s slow pace. So Trump really should be
pointing the finger at his own staff.

Comey added that the FBI looked back at previous cases involving the handling

criminal charges on these facts,” he said. “All the cases prosecuted involved
some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified

Trump keeps taking credit for projects that were long in the works before he
became president. For example, he repeatedly claims credit for Ford’s decision
to abandon its plans to open a factory in Mexico and instead expand its
Michigan plant. But analysts say Ford’s decision has more to do with the
company’s long-term goal — particularly, its plans to invest in electric
vehicles — than the administration. It’s easier for companies to find highly
skilled workers to build new products, such as electric cars, in the United
States than in Mexico.

Trump takes undue credit for business decisions made prior to his election.
Ford’s decision to abandon its plans to open a factory in Mexico and instead
expand its Michigan plant has more to do with the company’s long-term goal —
particularly its plans to invest in electric vehicles — than with the
administration. Fiat Chrysler's plan to invest $1 billion for a factory in
Michigan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with
Trump. Japanese company SoftBank announced its $100 billion technology
investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a
narrow path to victory. Sprint said its hiring plan was a part of a commitment
by SoftBank, which owns a controlling stake in Sprint.

Trump keeps taking credit for projects that were long in the works before he
became president. For example, he repeatedly claims credit for Ford’s decision
to abandon its plans to open a factory in Mexico and instead expand its
Michigan plant. But analysts say Ford’s decision has more to do with the
company’s long-term goal — particularly, its plans to invest in electric
vehicles — than the administration. It’s easier for companies to find highly
skilled workers to build new products, such as electric cars, in the United
States than in Mexico. Fiat Chrysler's plan to invest $1 billion for a factory
in Michigan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do

“NAFTA, a total disaster.”

Trump’s attack on NAFTA is over the top. It is often difficult to separate out
the impact of trade agreements on jobs, compared to other, broader economic
trends. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2015 concluded
the “net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been
relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for
a small percentage of U.S. GDP,” though it noted “there were worker and firm
adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and
investment among their economies.”

Trump takes credit for Ford’s decision to abandon its plans to open a factory
in Mexico and instead expand its Michigan plant. But analysts say Ford’s
decision has more to do with the company’s long-term goal — particularly, its
plans to invest in electric vehicles — than the administration. It’s easier
for companies to find highly skilled workers to build new products, such as
electric cars, in the United States than in Mexico.

Trump’s attack on NAFTA is over the top. It is often difficult to separate out
the impact of trade agreements on jobs, compared to other, broader economic
trends. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2015 concluded
the “net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been
relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for
a small percentage of U.S. GDP,” though it noted “there were worker and firm
adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and
investment among their economies.”

Trump takes credit for Ford’s decision to abandon its plans to open a factory
in Mexico and instead expand its Michigan plant. But analysts say Ford’s
decision has more to do with the company’s long-term goal — particularly, its
plans to invest in electric vehicles — than the administration. It’s easier
for companies to find highly skilled workers to build new products, such as
electric cars, in the United States than in Mexico.

Trump is exaggerating here. Boeing only had a $170 million contract to begin
designing a replacement for Air Force One, and the cost of the project had not
been set. The Defense Department’s five-year plan indicated a cost of $2.9
billion over the next five years for design and development. It’s logical to
assume at least another $1 billion in additional expenses to complete and
procure the aircraft. An estimate of $4 billion — for design, testing and
manufacture of at least two jets — was not completely out of line. But the
budget was subject to approval by Congress and the actual design of the
aircraft. So Trump is taking credit for cutting a price that had not been

Trump is referring to the estimated 1,250 (not “thousands”) refugees and
asylum-seekers that the United States, under Obama, agreed to accept from an
Australian detention center. Refugees and asylum-seekers who arrive illegally
by boat in Australia are called “illegal maritime arrivals.” They can apply
for two types of temporary visas, and some may qualify to apply for permanent
residency.

similar estimates on the cost of regulations. But there is an important

This is a flip-flop for Trump. Before becoming president, Trump heartily

about his then-rival Hillary Clinton. During a July 2016 news conference,
Trump even called on Russia to hack Clinton’s email account. Now, facing
information leaks out of his own administration (including information that
led to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn), Trump
decided it’s a bad thing.

Trump goes too far to claim that it is “very tough” for Syrian Christians to

opposite, even though the same U.N. agency handles the refugee requests. The
basic fact is that no one fully understands why there is such a disparity,
though it appears connected to the roots the Syrians have with Lebanon.

metro area has the highest median income in the nation -- $93,294 versus a
U.S. median of $55,775 -- though growth has slowed in recent years, in part
because of reductions in defense spending. Indeed, income in the D.C. area has
grown essentially at the same rate as the rest of the nation since 2006,
including a dip in median income during the Great Recession. But there is no
