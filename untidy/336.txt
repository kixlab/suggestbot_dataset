## 2. Global Warming

### Heating by the greenhouse effect

Our planets surface is now kept at a comfortable temperature because the
atmosphere traps some of the radiant heat from the Sun and keeps it near the
surface, warming the planet and sustaining living creatures. Jean Baptise
Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) first conceived the mechanism in the 1820s, while
wondering how the Suns heat could be retained to keep the Earth hot. Fouriers
idea, still accepted today, is that the atmosphere lets some of the Suns
radiation in, but it doesnt let all of the radiation back out. Visible
sunlight passes through our transparent atmosphere to warm the Earths land and
oceans, and some of this heat is reradiated in infrared form. The longer
infrared rays are less energetic than visible ones and do not slice through
the atmosphere as easily as visible light.

So our atmosphere absorbs some of the infrared heat radiation, and some of the
trapped heat is reradiated downward to warm the planets surface and the air
immediately above it. Fourier likened the thin atmospheric blanket to a huge
glass bell jar, made out of clouds and gases, that holds the Earths heat close
to its surface.

The warming by heat-trapping gases in the air is now known as the greenhouse
effect, but this is a misnomer. The air inside a garden greenhouse is heated
because it is enclosed, preventing the circulation of air currents that would
carry away heat and cool the interior. Nevertheless, the term is now so common
that we will also sometimes designate the heat-trapping gases as greenhouse
gases, and let greenhouse effect designate the process by which an atmosphere
traps heat near a planets surface.

Right now, the warming influence is literally a matter of life and death. It
keeps the average surface temperature of the planet at 288 degrees kelvin (15
degrees Celsius or 59 degrees Fahrenheit). Without this greenhouse effect, the
average surface temperature would be 255 degrees kelvin (-18 degrees Celsius
or 0 degrees Fahrenheit); a temperature so low that all water on Earth would
freeze, the oceans would turn into ice and life, as we know it, would not
exist.

The gases that absorb the most infrared heat radiation are minor ingredients
of our atmosphere. They are water vapor and carbon dioxide, with water vapor
absorbing the most. Sixty to seventy percent of the Earths greenhouse warming
is now caused by water vapor and carbon dioxide provides just a few degrees.

The main constituents of the atmosphere, nitrogen (77 percent) and oxygen (21
percent) play no part in the greenhouse effect. The two atoms in these
diatomic molecules are bound tightly together and are therefore incapable of
absorbing significant infrared radiation. In contrast, water vapor and carbon
dioxide molecules consist of three atoms that are less constrained in their
motion, so they absorb the heat radiation.

Why doesnt the atmosphere just keep heating up until it explodes? The
greenhouse warming rises to a fixed temperature that balances the heat input
from sunlight and the heat radiated into space. The level of water in a pond
similarly remains much the same even though water is running in one end and
out the other.
