>>

>> CO2 didn't initiate warming from past ice ages but it did amplify the
warming. In fact, about 90% of the global warming _followed_ the CO2 increase.

>>

>> ## Climate Myth...

>>

>> CO2 lags temperature  
>  "An article in _Science_ magazine illustrated that a rise in carbon dioxide
did not precede a rise in temperatures, but actually lagged behind temperature
rises by 200 to 1000 years. A rise in carbon dioxide levels could not have
caused a rise in temperature if it followed the temperature." (Joe Barton)

>>

>> Earth's climate has varied widely over its history, from ice ages
characterised by large ice sheets covering many land areas, to warm periods
with no ice at the poles. Several factors have affected past climate change,
including solar variability, volcanic activity and changes in the composition
of the atmosphere. Data from Antarctic ice cores reveals an interesting story
for the past 400,000 years. During this period, CO2 and temperatures are
closely correlated, which means they rise and fall together. However, based on
Antarctic ice core data, changes in CO2 follow changes in temperatures by
about 600 to 1000 years, as illustrated in Figure 1 below. This has led some
to conclude that CO2 simply cannot be responsible for current global warming.

>>

>> _Figure 1: Vostok ice core records for carbon dioxide concentration and
temperature change._

>>

>> This statement does not tell the whole story. The initial changes in
temperature during this period are explained by changes in the Earth's orbit
around the sun, which affects the amount of seasonal sunlight reaching the
Earth's surface. In the case of warming, the lag between temperature and CO2
is explained as follows: as ocean temperatures rise, oceans release CO2 into
the atmosphere. In turn, this release amplifies the warming trend, leading to
yet more CO2 being released. In other words, increasing CO2 levels become both
the cause and effect of further warming. This positive feedback is necessary
to trigger the shifts between glacials and interglacials as the effect of
orbital changes is too weak to cause such variation. Additional positive
feedbacks which play an important role in this process include other
greenhouse gases, and changes in ice sheet cover and vegetation patterns.

>>

>> A 2012 study by Shakun et al. looked at temperature changes 20,000 years
ago (the last glacial-interglacial transition) from around the world and added
more detail to our understanding of the CO2-temperature change relationship.
They found that:

triggered warming in the Arctic

flooding the oceans with fresh water.

oceans warmed first, starting

>>  
>>

>> about 18,000 years ago. As the Southern Ocean warms, the solubility of CO2
in water falls. This causes the oceans to give up more CO2, releasing it into
the atmosphere.

>>

>> While the orbital cycles triggered the initial warming, overall, more than
90% of the glacial-interglacial warming occured _after_ that atmospheric CO2
increase (Figure 2).

paper The ice-core record: climate sensitivity and future greenhouse warming

glacial-interglacial climate changes by amplifying, together with the growth
and decay of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, the relatively weak orbital
forcing"

ages. This was published over a decade before ice core records were accurate
enough to confirm a CO2 lag (thanks to John Mashey for the tip).

>> It is reasonable that warming of the oceans is in fact causing CO2 increase
in the paleo record. What I wonder about is how anyone can turn this into
evidence that CO2 causes warming?

>>

>> When I first saw this at an ACS function nearly 20 years ago these curves
were presented as proof of CO2 caused warming; despite the obvious fact that
the graphs, even then, showed that the temperature change was not following
but rather was leading the CO2 change. Now we are trying to explain away T
changing first invoking creative models. It appears the fundamental premise
that CO2 causes warming is simply not supported by the paleo record. It may
still be true, but what evidence do we have in the climate record that
supports this hypothesis?

>>

>> Here is another question: If ice ages are on 100,000 year cycles because
the Earth's orbit is more elongated on 100,000 year cycles why is the Earth's
orbit so round now? Shouldn't it be nearing maximum excentricity?

>>

>> **Response:** The paleo record shows that Antarctic temperatures rise about
~800 years before CO2 and Greenland temperatures rise after the CO2 rise. The
CO2 warming effect is necessary to explain both how weak orbital forcing can
get us out of an ice age and also how an orbital forcing that affects only
southern areas can spread through the globe. The paleo record also enables us
to compare Co2 forcing with temperature change to calculate climate
sensitivity.

temperature? Monnin 2001 doesn't display error bars but quantifies the lag as
around 800 ± 600 years:

>> RE: response  
>  Are we sure about that? I am sure the original data from way back then was
actually from Greenland ice cores, showing that temperature was rising before
CO2, there as well as in the Antarctic. The Antarctic data was not yet around.
If CO2 is rising first in Greenland than your hypothesis may be correct. I
know CO2 is supposed to cause warming, and I think I understand why. But, the
data still seems to scream corelation does not equal cause and effect.

>>

>> **Response:** The "original data from way back then" was probably Monnin
2001 which used the Dome Concordia ice core or Caillon 2003 which used the
Vostok core - both are from Antarctica. Caillon concludes "The sequence of
events during Termination III suggests that the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic
deglacial warming by 800 ± 200 years and preceded the Northern Hemisphere
deglaciation." More recently, Stott 2007 found that tropical temperatures lag
southern warming by ~1000 years. I agree with you - correlation does not
necessarily imply causation. But the ice core record is consistent with the
warming effect of CO2 and explains both the degree of deglaciation and how a
localised warming (increased insolation in the south) spread across the globe.

>> No, the American Chemical Society Conference at which I noted this
discrepency in a presented paper was in 1989 because I was in Grad Chemistry
courses at the time, so I much doubt that it was 2001 or 2003 data. Other than
that I hope you're right because otherwise 1)we are being led down the
primrose path and 2) I am freezing my butt off up here.

>>

>> The presenter after having this error spotted by a lowly physics type grad
student was not well recieved in the question session by the roomful of
chemistry PhD's that were present. None the less his hypothesis that CO2
causes global warming is still widely discussed. :)

>>

>> **Response:** I would be surprised if ice core records were of sufficient
resolution back in 1989 to clarify CO2 was lagging temperature - it's only
been more recent ice core records that have been of high enough resolution to
clarify the CO2 lag. Spencer Weart has published a great online history of ice
core measurements that is well worth a read.

>>

>> Without knowing which older studies you're talking about, the most recent
studies with up to date (and dare I say the most accurate) data (Monnin 2001,
Caillon 2003) paint a similar picture of Southern warming -> CO2 rise ->
Northern warming. But if you do know of any pertinent older papers, it'd be
great if you could post the links here. And kudos for sticking it to the man
:-)

>> First of all, John, thanks for spending the time to create and maintain
this site. I do realize it must be quite substantial time commitment.
Although, it is not exactly neutral and is somewhat driven by your current
opinion that GW is mostly due to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the forums on
the site are still one of the few places where we can have some more
meaningful debates based on some scientific thinking and facts. So, in some
respect the website is just like Churchill's quote on democracy (I think, he
is the right man to quote since as you've correctly noticed many things in the
GW debates on both sides are politically motivated consciously or not):

>>

>> "It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all
the others that have been tried. "

>>

>> Of course there are another two quotes from him that I think very much
apply to the GW debate:

>>

>> "The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the
average voter. "

>>

>> &

>>

>> "A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get
its pants on."

>>

>> Well, enogh quotes. On a more serious note, sadly enough, the whole field
of Climate Science and Global Warming has become just like Finance. There is
so much easy money flowing around that there is a great number of people with
all sorts of backgrounds and levels of knowledge that have no relation to
climate/physics or anything distinctly related (although by all means I am not
saying we should only used established scientists' work as a guideline) that
would make most outrageous claims/predictions with arbitrary certainty backed
up many low-quality science booklets/papers/reports, posh presentations and
heavy media support to streer more funds their way. In general, what I'm
refering to is the so-called "press release science", unfortunately endemic to
so many other fields besides climate.

>>

>> And finally, refering to the following quote from your bio section:

>>

>> "I'm still yet to meet a skeptic argument that is even vaguely convincing."

>>

>> I would suggest looking at some arguments that come from people that don't
exactly fit the typical skeptic stereotype you describe, for example take a
look at this list  
>  http://www.warwickhughes.com/hoyt/climate-change.htm

>>

>> and the following scorecard on the same website  
>  http://www.warwickhughes.com/hoyt/scorecard.htm

>>

>> **Response:** Love those quotes from Churchill. I must confess, I'm not
particularly impressed with Warwich Hughes' climate change page which reads a
lot like my Skeptic Arguments page (except mine is more comprehensive :-) His
scorecard is interesting - if I have more time after maintaining this site

>> All of the conclusions you make in your rebuttal of the skeptics argument
are valid only if the Milankovitch cycles (which as you note provide
relatively weak forcing) are indeed the sole cause for this whole process.
This seems like a big assumption to me and I don't think the science behind
that has been settled. Most of people sort of automatically assume it, but
there are number of scientists starting with John Imbrie (the guy who led the
whole CLIMAP effort and published the infamous Ice Ages: Solving the Mystery)
that say Milankovich cycles (Earth's orbital variations and such) seem to
explain only 50-60% of the whole insolation variance. So, adjusting one's
model only using insulation curves generated by orbital modeling as they do in
the papers you mention seems unjustified to me. In essence, the authors of the
above papers precondition themselves to look only for models that fits their
believes (that are only limited to Milankovich cycles as a driver). There are
many other additional hypothesis that also make sense even though their
quantification is not as simple as just writing an orbital mechanics models
which is all nice and simple with nice math functions. A major examples for
additional forcings on these time scales include changes in the solar
irradiation due to the long-term manifestations of the solar activity that are
ought to be much bigger that what we've observed with satellites for the past
20 years (I refer to the TSI measurements) and are not only related to the
TSI, but to things like the solar diameter, the solar wind and its
interactions with Earth's magnetic field and many other process on the Sun and
inside the Earth's core. Many things in the Solar System seem to work in
synergy. So, that many cycles and superpositions of cycles of completely
different physical processes external or internal to the Earth's climate have
similar length and appear as if only one factor is at work when in fact there
are several. I acknowledge that there is the Occam's razor that advocates
simplicity, but I don't necesesarily think it is the best approach when we are
considering Earth's climate and the near-Earth environment.

>>

>> So, I wasn't really asking about the lags, but whether we can even begin to
consider that these lags mean anything. As far as the error bars, I was asking
for the errors of the reconstruction models that create those curves on the
graphs you show. The lines only follow the positions of the 50% quantile of
each model output point but tell us nothing about its possible range (due to
original measurement errors and other uncertainties).

>>

>> **Response:** There's still a lot to be worked out re the whole mechanism
of deglaciations. For example, there are various theories on what causes the
CO2 increase after temperature increase, the most accepted theory being
degassing from the deep ocean. I've read of theories that the 100,000 year
cycle is caused by solar variations rather than orbital changes although the
Milankovitch theory seems to be more established and confirmed by at least
several papers I've read. But the main point of this page is to answer the
argument that "the CO2 lag debunks anthropogenic global warming". The current
scientific understanding of the CO2 record (and the papers quoted in citing
CO2 lag) state that the CO2 lag confirms the warming effect of well mixed
atmospheric CO2.

CO2 being a greenhouse gas, able to _cause_ warming as well as respond to
warming, is built on over a century of physics and lab analysis, and really,
really NOT just on a few graphs taken from ice cores and put up on the screen
by Al Gore.

terminations get moving so much faster than the very gradual Milankovic
forcings. The feedbacks don't run away forever because, for one, the carbon
dissolved in the ocean is not infinite, the ice albedo feedback runs out when
the glaciers and sea ice have retreated, etc.

>> I have two questions regarding this "CO2 lags temperature" argument. You
say that the Milankovitch cycle is to weak to explain the big temperature
difference and that it requires strengthening through energy absorption by
means of CO2. How do we know that CO2 is the main cause and not something
else, e.g., the change in Earth's albedo due to ice and snowcover ?

>>

>> Also you say that it is not fully understood how oceans give up CO2. What
about the reverse, the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere when the
Milankovitch cycle drives the temperature down ?

>> This idea that Malinkovitch needs CO2 feedback to do the job is clearly
false. Since it relies on a WATTS-PER-SQUARE-METRE model which is a light-and-
air-only model.

>>

>> If we allow for the accumulation and decumulation of joules in the planet
and the oceans then it is the factor of TIME ALONE that needs to be taken into
account and not this sideshow of CO2-feedback.

>>

>> We ought to be looking at a model which relies on STRATA AND HEAT BUDGETS.

>>

>> Not on WPSM. The WPSM model is a first draught that people came up with
looking through telescopes. They couldn't see anything else so they imagined
the whole thing could be determined by spectroscopy alone. But what we are
talking about is the accumulation and decumulation of joules.

>>

>> Another thing that these WPSM models fail to take into account is the
distance travelled through the atmosphere.

>>

>> The stratosphere ends about 50km up in the air. But that doesn't mean that
a "ray" of light hitting the stratosphere has to travel only 50km.

>>

>> This is only true at the equator and at high noon. And this is important
since the climate guys talk as if only greenhouse gas and ozone can attenuate
this radiation. But all gasses inhibit radiation and a lot of this radiation
has a very long way to go.

DECUMULATION of joules over many decades and years is a fatal flaw to these
climate models.

spectrum then industrial-CO2-release ought to substantially warm things up on

>> Actually, Milankovitch hypothesis requires much more than
WATTS_PER_SQUARE_METRE. The thing is that GLOBAL year-average solar flux does
not change more than 0.1% during those cycles. Climatologists like to plot
amplitude of "Milankovitch forcing" at one spot on Earth - at latitude 65N,
which does not represent in any way or form the GLOBAL change in incoming
radiation. I find this very misleading, especially when the whole talk is
about GLOBAL warming. For the Milankovitch to have any effect on Earth,
climatologists have to use a hidden assumption that Nothern Hemishpere
controls the whole climate by having some sort of "rectifier effect". So far
this rectifier has not been identified, and ony speculations exist that it has
something to do with more land in NH than in SH, and maybe with Arctic ice
having contact with land (Greenland etc).

>> I am familiar with this book, it is really a university level physics
textbook, under which I mean "entry level". One needs to realize that the
explanation of GH effect inherently relies upon so-called "atmospheric lapse
rate", to link the height of "effective emission layer" with surface
temperatures. One really needs to realize that so-called "lapse rate" must be
an average of all atmospheric structures and weather patterns over the whole
globe and from ground up to the whole troposphere. One needs to realize that
the atmospheric patterns include turbulent boundary layer, global circulation
patterns (Hadley, Ferrel, and polar cells), jet streams, hurricanes and other
tropical depressions. More importantly, the lapse rate is strongly affected by
moisture, which, in turn, is strongly affected by sea temperature. What is
more important is that the moisture tends to condense into clouds under
certain atmospheric/aerosols conditions. The laps rate ("moisture adiabate")
tends to DECREASE with higher moisture content providing a negative feedback.
Clouds also provide negative feedback by reducing insolation.

>>

>> Needless to say that all of listed processes occur under strong non-
isotropic turbulent conditions, and are way beyond the reach of any direct
computer modeling. As result, either a hand-made parameterizations have to be
used, or parameterizations of experimental data. Given the spatio-temporal
complexity of atmospheric patterns, data from few weather balloons cannot be
seriously considered as a good representation of average atmospheric
structure. The reference to HITRAN/MODTRAN serves no purpose for this
discussion since the code uses a pre-selected fixed MODEL of atmospheric
profile. In MODTRAN, there are 84 different models for atmospheric profiles;
each gives different result for amount of OLR and surface temperature. So,
what would be your selection of models across the globe to include into a
global greenhouse model? How objective or subjective it could be? As you see,
the "fundamental physics" of absorption spectra or two-stream Schwarzschild
equations are not all the sophistications you need to build a model of GH
effect and calculate its amplitude.

>> Tekhasski, you sure can pile on the jargon but the basic argument is not
affected by what you or GMB are saying: sunlight comes in with a small amount
of long-wavelength infrared (so does not get absorbed so much by CO2, methane,
NO2, etc.), gets absorbed, then tries to head out again as blackbody
radiation, which is mostly in the long-infrared range and is strongly absorbed
by the accumulating CO2, methane, NO2, etc. in the atmosphere.

>>

>> There is no heat being added unless you are talking about variation in
Solar output. The warming is supposed to be the result of Earth holding on to
more heat and releasing it more slowly. The Earth is not a Black body
radiator, but that doesn't even matter because CO2 isn't a big absorber of
black body radiation at this temperature.

>>

>> Or this comment "We already know that increased carbon dioxide causes
warming, so this means that the warming will be amplified by increased CO2
emission from the oceans."

>> This is simply not correct. We think it should work this way, we have some
theoretical reason to believe it should. But, it has rather badly failed the
experimental test so far. In addition if your assertion were true this would
be a positive feedback loop that is clearly not present in the Earth's paleo
record. If the climate really worked this way the Earth would be vastly warmer
than it is and would never have had any ice ages because once the CO2 got
high, as it has many times in the past, it would cause a warming spiral.

for the past how many years? Modern direct measurement of gases using a bench
and means of interpreting past CO2 are not going to give the same results.
Even trapped gas pockets in ice suffer from osmotic action. Past climates are
mostly guesswork. As Wondering Aloud points out "it would cause a warming
spiral." but that did not happen. The graph shows 450K years, ALL of which
were within the oscillations of an ice age. We assume that this is an

>> CO2 clearly cannot be meaningless, it has long been known to be infra-red
active and remains resident in the atmosphere for a long time, from memory
~33% remains after one hundred years and 20% after a thousand years, but there
is a long tail meaning that some will remain for tens of thousands of years,
causing significant warming. Inevitably, this alone will affect the net heat
balance of the Earth. Of course CO2 is NOT the only GHG and as temperature
increases, so does the water vapour, which acts as a positive feedback
amplification. But while water vapour is a stronger GHG than CO2, it does not
remain in the atmosphere for long.

>> The source of the excess CO2 is explained by the shifting isotopic ratio of
the atmospheric carbon. From this it is known to originate from non-biological
sources - i.e. fossil carbon: coal, oil & gas.

light oxygen availability is a direct reflection of water vapor concentration
in the atmosphere. So what’s the dominant driving agent? Is it CO2? Is it
water vapor?

studies, they seem anecdotal. If CO2’s effect were consistently strong (and
it’s causes steeper temperature changes at lower concentrations) then
temperatures would follow more closely to the CO2 line, but they don’t,
temperatures follow the water vapor line (and vice versa). What CO2 effect
there is is inconclusive.

contemporary CO2 levels have surpassed the level of spectral absorption that
has been claimed to have caused that much warming in the paleo record. And the
more CO2 is added to the air, the less additional effect it has in a trend of
progressively diminishing returns.

agree. But there is a feedback that has a minor effect and can be viewed as
symptomatic. Spencer gives a good explanation for this, the sensitivity to CO2
is lower than the sensitivity of other drivers/forcings and easily overcome
which is indicated in the current cooling trend. The idea that CO2 caused AGW
therefore is rather meaningless since it is not strong enough to have driven
climate change from 1975 through 2007. Recent articles on ocean oscillations
and plate tectonics/vulcanism indicate that "The solar jerk" is at work.

>> Apparently climatologists do not have much grounding in how feedback works.
Unaware of their ignorance, they invoke net positive feedback in their GCMs.
This causes the GCMs to predict significant ‘enhanced global warming’. Anyone
who has the ability and interest to look at the NOAA data from Vostok Ice
Cores for the last glaciation (and prior glaciations) will discover that,
repeatedly, a temperature increasing trend changed to a decreasing trend with
the carbon dioxide level higher than it had been when the temperature was
increasing. Graphs of NOAA and other credible data, all fully sourced so they
can be verified, can be seen at http://www.middlebury.net/op-ed/pangburn.html.
(The web site is controlled by Middlebury, not me.) Those who understand how
feedback works will know that this temperature trend reversal is not possible
with significant net positive feedback. Thus, as far as global climate is
concerned and contrary to the assumption in the GCMs, significant net positive
feedback from water vapor does not exist.

>> Response of the climate system depends on the combined effect of ALL
feedbacks, known or not. When all are combined, the NET feedback can not be
significantly positive. This is mandated by the temperature trend reversals of
the last and previous glaciations. Without net positive feedback, the GCMs do
not predict significant Global Warming. Other assessments from entirely
different perspectives also determine that there is no significant net
positive feedback. They can be seen at http://www.climate-

>>

>> You each dismiss the possibility of feedbacks to CO2-induced warming,
without really explaining your problem. In each case this seems to relate to
the observation that during Milankovitch cycles associated with glacial-
interglacial-glacial transitions, the earth's temperature drops while
atmospheric CO2 levels remain high for a while. But isn't that exactly what's
expected if the CO2 rise and fall is itself a feedback from the primary
(Milnkovitch-induced) warming?

>>

>> Obviously atmospheric CO2 levels will lag behind temperature levels on both
the rising and falling parts of the cycle. It's a question of relative
magnitudes of forcings, and the timescales for various re-equilibration to
changes in forcings. If the solar (insolation) dominates (as we consider to be
the case), then it will "dominate" the effects of CO2, feedbacks and all.

>>

>> We could make an analogy with the day night cycle. Right now atmospheric
CO2 levels are the highest they've been for many millions of years and the
Earth is warming. However last night while CO2 levels were extraordinarily
high (382 ppm or whatever the current value is), when the sun went down, it
got a bit cooler. In fact as the air cooled last night some of the water
vapour precipitated out and it rained....

>>

>> Now that scenario doesn't indicate that raised atmospheric CO2 doesn't have
an associated positive water vapour feedback. It clearly does (we can measure
this in the real world). It just means that the insolation effect dominates
the CO2 effect, feedbacks and all.

>>

>> The associated thing that needs to be considered is the timescale of the
effects. The CO2 feedback to warming is very slow (and likewise to cooling).
Once atmospheric CO2 levels are raised they stay that way for a long time. But
both the warming effect of CO2 and its water vapour feedback are a consequence
of an interaction with the insolation. If the insolation drops, then the
greenhouse effect of the raised CO2 and water vapour will drop immediately.
And a reduction in the feedbacks will follow on different timescales. The
water vapour feedback will drop quickly (days to months following reduced
warming resulting from reduced insolation)....the atmospheric CO2 levels will
remain high for a very long time following the temperature drop and will drop
much, much more slowly in response to the cooling. In fact in the cooling part
of the cycle the secondary feedback on the warming cycle (water vapour
following the CO2 rise) will seem to reduce much more quickly than the primary
feedback (the raised atmospheric CO2).

>>

>> Another way of thinking about this is to recognisie the truism that the
earth's equilibrium temperature will fluctuate (by internal variations of the
climate system) around a level that is "set" by whatever level of greenhouse
gas concentrations and insolation that happens to pertain. However the rates
at which these equilibria are attained depends on the rates at which various
feedbacks respond. So what might seem to be anomalous phenomena, are not
unexpected at all....

>> Well that's good Quietman....you don't have a problem with some of the
simple expectations of CO2 feedbacks as they apply under the influence of
Milankovitch cycles.

>>

>> On the other hand it's not obvious why you consider a truism to be an
assumption! It's been known since the middle of the 19th century that the
earth's temperature is defined by the insolation from the sun (which gives the
Earth a black body temperature near -15 oC) and the greenhouse effect arising
largely from water vapour and CO2 that supplements the black body temperature
by around 30 oC.

>>

>> That's pretty much a truism. One cannot pretend that the greenhouse effect
doesn't exist! So the solar and greenhouse contributions effectively set the
earth's equilibrium temperature, and stochastic and cyclical variations in the
climate system (wind and ocean currents) and volcanic effects, give rise to
fluctuations around the equilibrium temperature. Occasionally rather horrible
impacts from extraterrestrial sources or catastrophic tectonic events generate
major abrupt perturbations. But otherwise it's the sun and the greenhouse
effect.

>>

>> ...and indeed the major independent variable with respect to the greenhouse
effect is the atmnospheric CO2 (and methane somewhat, especially in the deep
past) concentration, since as we all know very well, atmospheric water vapour
concentrations rather passively follow the atmospheric temperature (and
pressure).
