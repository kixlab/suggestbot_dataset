## Abstract

### Aim:

To determine the risk of lung cancer associated with cannabis smoking.

### Methods:

A case-control study of lung cancer in adults ≤55 years of age was conducted
in eight district health boards in New Zealand. Cases were identified from the
New Zealand Cancer Registry and hospital databases. Controls were randomly
selected from the electoral roll, with frequency matching to cases in 5-year
age groups and district health boards. Interviewer administered questionnaires
were used to assess possible risk factors including cannabis use. The relative
risk of lung cancer associated with cannabis smoking was estimated by logistic
regression.

### Results:

There were 79 cases of lung cancer and 324 controls. The risk of lung cancer
increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after
adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95%
CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for
confounding variables including cannabis smoking. The highest tertile of
cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer RR=5.7 (95%
CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment for confounding variables including
cigarette smoking.

### Conclusions:

Long term cannabis use increases the risk of lung cancer in young adults.

**Keywords:** Cannabis, tobacco, lung cancer, case-control

## INTRODUCTION

Cannabis smoking may have a greater potential than tobacco smoking to cause
lung cancer.[1-4] Cannabis smoke is qualitatively similar to tobacco smoke,
although it contains up to twice the concentration of the carcinogenic
polyaromatic hydrocarbons.[1] Cannabis is less densely packed than tobacco
cigarettes, and tends to be smoked without filters [2] to a smaller butt
size,[3] leading to higher concentrations of smoke inhaled. Furthermore,
smokers of cannabis inhale more deeply and hold their breath for longer,[4]
facilitating the deposition of the carcinogenic products in the lower
respiratory tract. These factors are likely to be responsible for the five-
fold greater absorption of carbon monoxide from a cannabis joint, compared
with a tobacco cigarette of similar size despite similar carbon monoxide
concentrations in the smoke inhaled.[4] Several studies have demonstrated pre-
cancerous histological [5,6] and molecular [7] abnormalities in the
respiratory tracts of cannabis smokers, and the carcinogenic effects of
cannabis smoke have been demonstrated in vitro [8] and in different in vivo
animal models.[1,9,10] Conversely, there is also evidence that
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol may have anti-carcinogenic effects.[11-13]

Epidemiological evidence for an association between cannabis and lung cancer
is limited and conflicting. Case series have suggested a causative role for
cannabis in lung cancer in young adults.[14,15] The few published case-control
studies have shown both the presence [16-18] and absence [19] of an
association, but have been limited by the inability to quantify use,[16-18]
confounding with combined cannabis and tobacco use,[16-18] studies being
undertaken in populations in which use may have serious legal consequences
resulting in potential information bias [16-19] and poor response rates.[19]

New Zealand represents an ideal country in which to study the association
between cannabis and respiratory tract cancer. New Zealand has a high rate of
cannabis use,[20] and it is rarely mixed with tobacco within the joint [21] as
is the custom in the United Kingdom.[22] New Zealand has among the highest
rates of lung cancer worldwide with the indigenous Maori population having the
highest incidence of any ethnic group.[23] These circumstances provided the
opportunity to undertake a case-control study to investigate the association
between lung cancer and cannabis use in young people.

## METHODS

### Study participants

Cases were patients with confirmed lung cancer aged 55 years and under at the
time of diagnosis, identified from hospital databases and the New Zealand
Cancer Registry between January 2001 and July 2005. Cases were a mixture of
prevalent and incident cases of lung cancer. Subjects were excluded if they
had lung metastasis from a distant primary other than lung, or a histological
diagnosis of carcinoid or melanoma. Age at diagnosis, anatomical location of
their malignancy and histological type were collected for cases. Controls
without lung cancer were randomly selected from the electoral roll and
frequency matched in 5-year age groups and district health boards. Subjects
came from eight district health board regions, serving both urban and rural
populations. The eight District Health Boards together serve approximately 1.8
million people, representing just under half of the total New Zealand
population. The study was approved by the regional ethics committees and each
participant gave written informed consent. Patients with cancers of the head
and neck were also interviewed, but will be reported separately.

### Methods

Questionnaires were administered face-to-face by trained interviewers, usually
at the home of the participant. Information on demographics (including ethnic
group), smoking history, passive smoking exposure, recreational drug use,
diet, occupation, income, education, alcohol consumption and family history of
malignancy was collected. A family history of lung cancer was defined as
having a sibling or parent with lung cancer. Occupations associated with a
higher risk of lung cancer were identified from the literature and subjects
were assigned a 'duration at risk' value in years. Ethnicity was derived by
priority coding of the responses into three groups; Maori, Pacific Islander
and 'other'. The highest level of educational attainment was recorded, as was
income at diagnosis (or reference age). Alcohol consumption was calculated
using a semi-quantitative score based on amount and frequency of consumption.

Subjects who reported having ever smoked 20 or more joint of cannabis were
then asked to complete a more detailed exposure questionnaire regarding their
cannabis smoking. This questionnaire obtained information about the age of
starting cannabis use, the amount, frequency and duration of use, and the
characteristics of their smoking. This information was collected for each
period of their lives when pattern of use changed and was then summed to give
an estimate of total lifetime use. If subjects smoked cannabis in a form other
than a joint, e.g. pipes or bongs, they were asked to estimate the number of
cannabis joints to which that would equate. This conversion allowed cannabis
use for all participants to be quantified in joint-years of use, with 1 joint-
year being equivalent to 1 joint per day for 1 year. Subjects who had smoked
<20 and ≥20 cannabis joints in their lifetime were classified as non-smokers
and smokers of cannabis respectively. A similar approach of determining
lifetime use of cigarettes was employed to enable pack-years of cigarette
smoking to be calculated, with 1 pack-year equivalent to 20 cigarettes per day
for 1 year. Subjects who reported smoking tobacco cigarettes occasionally but
never daily, or daily at some stage in their life, were classified as non-
smokers and smokers of cigarettes, respectively. The questionnaire was piloted
among ex-cannabis smokers.

### Analysis

Standard methods for analysis of case-control studies were used. The mean
delay from diagnosis to interview was subtracted from the date of interview to
calculate a reference date for duration of exposure for each control. Tertiles
of cannabis use were determined by the marginal distribution of use for all
subjects to reduce the chance of zero cell counts if just the control group
was used. Relative risks were estimated by calculating odds ratios by logistic
regression using SPSS version 11.0 for Mac OSX (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) and
adjusted for confounding variables. Adjustment for age, joint-years of
cannabis smoking and pack-years of cigarette smoking was made by including
them as continuous variables in the regression models. The effects of
categories of pack-years of cigarette smoking (quintiles of smoking for all
subjects interviewed) and joint-years of cannabis smoking (tertiles of use for
all subjects interviewed) were also assessed. The relative risks were also
calculated based on cannabis use up to 5 years prior to diagnosis or reference
date in the controls, on the basis that exposure after that time was unlikely
to have caused the malignancy. The age at which cannabis smoking started was
categorised, and the relative risk associated with starting <16 years of age,
compared with ≥21 years was estimated. Various logistic regression models were
fitted with potential confounders as continuous and categorical variables, and
the estimates of relative risk and the confidence intervals were not
appreciably different from the results presented.

### Power calculation

Assuming that 15% of the population smokes cannabis, a sample size of 75 cases
and 300 controls had 80% and 90% power at a type 1 error rate of 5% to detect
an odds ratio of lung cancer of 2.4 and 2.7, respectively.

## RESULTS

A total of 102 eligible cases were contacted and invited for interview of whom
79 (77%) agreed to participate. There were 493 controls contacted and invited
for interview of whom 324 (66%) agreed to participate.

The 79 cases of lung cancer included 16 (20%) small-cell and 63 (80%) non-
small-cell cancers. This is consistent with the established distribution of
histological type seen in the general population.[24] There were 39 (49%)
female cases of lung cancer, similar to the female proportion (50%) of all
lung cancer cases aged <55 years in New Zealand between 1998 and 2003.[25] The
risk of lung cancer did not vary with age, due to cases and controls being
frequency matched on 5-year age group to improve the efficiency of the study.
A family history of lung cancer was associated with an increased risk of lung
cancer (RR=3.9, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.4). There was no significant association
between lung cancer risk and passive smoking, diet, occupation, income,
educational level, and alcohol use after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity,
cigarette smoking and a family history of lung cancer. The proportion of
controls (aged 35 to 55 years) who had ever smoked cannabis, with age-
adjustment for the age distribution of the general population was 36%, similar
to the 40-52% reported amongst the younger 15 to 45 year age group, in New
Zealand population surveys undertaken between 1990 and 2001.[20]

While cannabis smoking (defined as lifetime use of ≥20 joints) was not
associated with a significantly increased risk of lung cancer (Table 3), those
with the highest tertile of use (>10.5 joint-years of exposure) had a
significantly increased risk, RR=5.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment
for age, sex, ethnicity, pack-years of cigarette smoking and a family history
of lung cancer. Using the prevalence of the highest tertile of cannabis
smoking of the controls we estimated that about 5% of lung cancer in those
aged 55 years and under in New Zealand may be attributable to cannabis
smoking.

**Adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, family history of lung cancer, pack-years

measured using a semi-quantitative scale.

Cigarette use (pack-years) quintiles were; <4.7, 4.7-14, 14.1-23.8,
23.81-34.5, >34.5.

Cannabis use (joint-years) tertiles were: <1.39, 1.39 -10.5, >10.5.

When joint-years of use were fitted as a continuous variable, thus providing
greater statistical power than the assessment by tertile of use, a significant
increasing risk, 8%, with each joint-year of use was found (RR=1.08, 95% CI
1.02 to 1.15) (Table 2). The strength of the association was maintained when
cannabis use in the 5 years prior to diagnosis, or reference date for
controls, was excluded (RR=1.10, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.18). (Table 2). A
significant increase in the risk was also observed with increasing cigarette
smoking, with a 7% increase in risk for each pack-year of exposure (RR=1.07,
95% CI 1.05 to 1.09), after adjustment for confounding variables including
cannabis smoking. Therefore, the increased risk for each pack-year of
cigarette smoking was similar to that for each joint-year of cannabis use.

Among users of cannabis no significant correlation between joint-years of use
and age of onset of use was found (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.077,
P=0.56). Compared with subjects who started smoking cannabis aged 21 or older,
those that started under the age of 16 had a relative risk of lung cancer of
10.3 (95% CI 0.8 to 132) after adjustment for joint-years of cannabis use,
pack-years of cigarette smoking, age, sex, ethnicity, and a family history of
lung cancer.

## DISCUSSION

This population-based case-control study provides evidence of a relationship
between smoking cannabis and lung cancer in young adults. For each joint-year
of cannabis exposure the risk of lung cancer was estimated to increase by 8%.

There are a number of methodological considerations relevant to the
interpretation of these findings. We studied subjects aged 55 years or younger
due to published case series,[14,15] which suggested a strong association
between cannabis use and lung cancer in young adults. Additionally, the
lifetime exposure of older individuals would be expected to be much lower as
they would have been older than the typical age for onset of use when the
"epidemic" of cannabis use began in the 1960's. Due to the low incidence of
lung cancer in this age group, representing less than 10% of all lung
cancers,[23] cases diagnosed up to 5 years before interview were included. If
survival after diagnosis was different for users compared to non-users of
cannabis, this may have influenced the results obtained. Cases were identified
from both the National Cancer Registry and from hospital outpatient and
discharge databases to ensure case ascertainment was as complete as possible.

In the initial approach no mention was made of the primary risk factor of
interest to avoid recruitment bias with either the cases or the controls. To
minimize response bias the interviewer did not state the specific research
hypothesis and took a detailed history of all well known risk factors.
Cannabis exposure was measured as joint-years of cannabis use, which combines
both the intensity (amount and frequency) and duration of use. This approach
follows the current convention for quantifying life long cannabis consumption
and recognizes the evidence that the risk of lung cancer with cigarette
smoking is related to both intensity and duration of use.[26] Recall of the
amount of cannabis smoked over a long period of time may have been difficult
for some subjects, however, this is likely to have been similar for both cases
and controls as subjects were not aware of the study hypothesis.

We used a population-based control group rather than a hospital-based control
group as the latter is susceptible to significant bias due to the many medical
conditions associated with cannabis use.[27,28] In recognition of the low
incidence of lung cancer in the age group studied, we studied four controls
for each case to increase the power of the study.

The major finding from this study was that for each joint-year of cannabis
exposure, the risk of lung cancer increased by 8%, after adjustment for
confounding variables including tobacco smoking. A major differential risk
between cannabis and cigarette smoking was observed, with 1 joint of cannabis
similar to about 20 cigarettes for risk of lung cancer. This is consistent
with the observation that smoking 'a few' cannabis joints a day causes similar
histological changes in the tracheobronchial epithelium as smoking 20-30
tobacco cigarettes a day.[29] It has also been reported that smoking 2 joints
per day results in cytomorphological abnormalities in the sputum, similar to
about 30 cigarettes per day.[30,31] These differential risks are greater than
the 1:5 dose ratio between cannabis and tobacco for carbon monoxide levels and
the 1:3 dose ratio for amount of tar inhaled,[4]. This suggests that as well
as differences in smoking topography, in which cannabis joints are usually
smoked without a filter,[2] to a smaller butt size,[3] using deeper and longer
inhalation techniques,[4] differences in chemical composition of cannabis and
cigarette smoke may also be responsible for the differences in their lung
cancer risks. In this regard, cannabis smoke has been shown to have greater
concentrations of the carcinogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbons benz[a]pyrene and
benz[a]anthracene than cigarette smoke.[1]

The risk of lung cancer from cannabis use was restricted to the upper tertile
of joint-years of use, with a 5.7-fold greater risk in those with more than
10.5 joint-years of cannabis use. However, it is unlikely that this represents
a threshold effect, as a linear relationship has been clearly demonstrated
between tobacco cigarette consumption and risk of lung cancer.[32] The lack of
an association in the lower tertiles may be due to the relatively small number
of cannabis users in the study and the young age of subjects reducing the time
available for high numbers of joint-years to accumulate, resulting in low
levels of exposure (up to 1.39 joint-years for the lower tertile).

Further analysis was undertaken in which the risk of lung cancer was assessed
for cannabis use up to 5 years prior to the diagnosis. This approach was based
on evidence that in most cases with lung cancer, the duration between
malignant change and diagnosis is greater than 5 years.[33] When cannabis use
in the 5 years prior to diagnosis for the cases (and prior to the reference
date for the controls) was excluded from the analysis the strength of the
association was maintained, as would be expected if a causal association
existed, with a 10% increase in risk for each joint-year of exposure.

There was some suggestion that the risk of lung cancer may increase with
earlier onset of cannabis use but the small number of subjects prevented more
detailed assessment of this potential risk factor. However, such an
association would be consistent with the evidence that the age of onset of
tobacco smoking is a determinant of lung cancer risk.[34,35] Further case-
control studies are needed to quantify the lung cancer risk associated with
cannabis use, including the influence of the age of starting cannabis smoking,
the dose-response relationship, and the dose equivalence with cigarette
smoking.

In the young adults we studied, the population attributable risk for cancer of
the lung with cannabis smoking was estimated to be 5%. If any increased risk
was maintained as these young people age, then a considerable burden from lung
cancer due to cannabis smoking may occur in the future.

Our findings are consistent with the three North African case-control studies
[16-18] which have reported a six to eight-fold increased risk of lung cancer
with cannabis smoking, although the lack of detailed smoking histories and the
custom of mixing cannabis with tobacco may have contributed to the risks
observed. In contrast, a large case-control study from California with an
estimated participation rate in cases of only 39% reported no association
between cannabis use and lung cancer.[19] The controls in the Californian
study were matched for neighbourhood which may have made detection of an
association less likely, as cannabis use is likely to be similar within
distinct neighbourhoods. This may have contributed to the higher rates of
cannabis use in the controls than previously reported from California.[36]
Also, African-American people were less likely to have participated than other
ethnic groups, suggesting significant selection bias may have occurred. A
positive relationship between cannabis use and cigarette smoking was observed
in the controls, but the opposite relationship was present in the lung cancer
cases, which also suggests selection bias or differential reporting between
cases and controls.

These studies, and our own, highlight the difficulties inherent in undertaking
epidemiological research of the effects of cannabis. While it is important to
interpret the findings in the context of these limitations, the balance of
evidence would suggest a positive association between cannabis and lung
cancer. This issue is of major public health importance, due to the prevalent
use of cannabis globally and lung cancer being responsible for over a million
deaths each year.[37,38] With the prevalence and mortality from lung cancer
increasing, prevention by risk factor modification is of paramount importance.
Major efforts are being made to reduce the prevalence of tobacco smoking.[39]
The findings of this study suggest that these public health programmes may
need to include greater initiatives to reduce cannabis smoking and should be
directed particularly at young people.
