# Empirical evidence that humans are causing global warming

Link to this page

## What the science says...

| Select a level...| ![](images/_core/other/level1.gif) **Basic** | |
![](images/_core/other/level2.gif) Intermediate | |  
---|---|---|---|---|--- 

Less energy is escaping to space: Carbon dioxide (CO2) acts like a blanket;
adding more CO2 makes the 'blanket' thicker, and humans are adding more CO2
all the time.

## Climate Myth...

There's no empirical evidence  
"There is no actual evidence that carbon dioxide emissions are causing global
warming. Note that computer models are just concatenations of calculations you
could do on a hand-held calculator, so they are theoretical and cannot be part
of any evidence." (David Evans)

The proof that man-made CO2 is causing global warming is like the chain of
evidence in a court case. CO2 keeps the Earth warmer than it would be without
it. Humans are adding CO2 to the atmosphere, mainly by burning fossil fuels.
And there is empirical evidence that the rising temperatures are being caused
by the increased CO2.

**The Earth is wrapped in an invisible blanket**

It is the Earth's atmosphere that makes most life possible. To understand
this, we can look at the moon. On the surface, the moon's temperature during
daytime can reach 100°C (212°F). At night, it can plunge to minus 173°C, or
-279.4°F. In comparison, the coldest temperature on Earth was recorded in
Antarctica: −89.2°C (−128.6°F). According to the WMO, the hottest was 56.7°C
(134°F), measured on 10 July 1913 at Greenland Ranch (Death Valley).

Man could not survive in the temperatures on the moon, even if there was air
to breathe. Humans, plants and animals can't tolerate the extremes of
temperature on Earth unless they evolve special ways to deal with the heat or
the cold. Nearly all life on Earth lives in areas that are more hospitable,
where temperatures are far less extreme.

Yet the Earth and the moon are virtually the same distance from the sun, so
why do we experience much less heat and cold than the moon? The answer is
because of our atmosphere. The moon doesn't have one, so it is exposed to the
full strength of energy coming from the sun. At night, temperatures plunge
because there is no atmosphere to keep the heat in, as there is on Earth.

The laws of physics tell us that without the atmosphere, the Earth would be
approximately 33°C (59.4°F) cooler than it actually is.

This would make most of the surface uninhabitable for humans. Agriculture as
we know it would be more or less impossible if the average temperature was −18
°C. In other words, it would be freezing cold even at the height of summer.

The reason that the Earth is warm enough to sustain life is because of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases act like a blanket, keeping
the Earth warm by preventing some of the sun's energy being re-radiated into
space. The effect is exactly the same as wrapping yourself in a blanket - it
reduces heat loss from your body and keeps you warm.

If we add more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, the effect is like wrapping
yourself in a thicker blanket: even less heat is lost. So how can we tell what
effect CO2 is having on temperatures, and if the increase in atmospheric CO2
is really making the planet warmer?

One way of measuring the effect of CO2 is by using satellites to compare how
much energy is arriving from the sun, and how much is leaving the Earth. What
scientists have seen over the last few decades is a gradual decrease in the
amount of energy being re-radiated back into space. In the same period, the
amount of energy arriving from the sun has not changed very much at all. This
is the first piece of evidence: **more energy is remaining in the
atmosphere**.

![](https://skepticalscience.com/graphics/Total_Heat_Content_2011_med.jpg)

_Total Earth Heat Content fromChurch et al. (2011)_

What can keep the energy in the atmosphere? The answer is greenhouse gases.
Science has known about the effect of certain gases for over a century. They
'capture' energy, and then emit it in random directions. The primary
greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), water vapour, nitrous
oxide and ozone - comprise around 1% of the air.

This tiny amount has a very powerful effect, keeping the planet 33°C (59.4°F)
warmer than it would be without them. (The main components of the atmosphere -
nitrogen and oxygen - are not greenhouse gases, because they are virtually
unaffected by long-wave, or infrared, radiation). This is the second piece of
evidence: **a provable mechanism by which energy can be trapped in the
atmosphere.**

For our next piece of evidence, we must look at the amount of CO2 in the air.
We know from bubbles of air trapped in ice cores that before the industrial
revolution, the amount of CO2 in the air was approximately 280 parts per
million (ppm). In June 2013, the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory in
Hawaii announced that, for the first time in thousands of years, the amount of
CO2 in the air had gone up to 400ppm. That information gives us the next piece
of evidence; **CO2 has increased by nearly 43% in the last 150 years.**

![](https://skepticalscience.com/images/CO2-Emissions-vs-Levels.gif)

_Atmospheric CO2 levels (Green is Law Dome ice core, Blue is Mauna Loa,
Hawaii) and Cumulative CO2 emissions (CDIAC). While atmospheric CO2 levels are
usually expressed in parts per million, here they are displayed as the amount
of CO2 residing in the atmosphere in gigatonnes. CO2 emissions includes fossil
fuel emissions, cement production and emissions from gas flaring._

### **The Smoking Gun**

The final piece of evidence is 'the smoking gun', the proof that CO2 is
causing the increases in temperature. CO2 traps energy at very specific
wavelengths, while other greenhouse gases trap different wavelengths. In
physics, these wavelengths can be measured using a technique called
spectroscopy. Here's an example:

![](https://skepticalscience.com/images/Greenhouse_Spectrum.gif)

_Spectrum of the greenhouse radiation measured at the surface. Greenhouse
effect from water vapor is filtered out, showing the contributions of other
greenhouse gases (Evans 2006)._

The graph shows different wavelengths of energy, measured at the Earth's
surface. Among the spikes you can see energy being radiated back to Earth by
ozone (O3), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N20). But the spike for CO2 on
the left dwarfs all the other greenhouse gases, and tells us something very
important: **most of the energy being trapped in the atmosphere corresponds
exactly to the wavelength of energy captured by CO2.**

### **Summing Up**

Like a detective story, first you need a victim, in this case the planet
Earth: **more energy is remaining in the atmosphere.**

Then you need a method, and ask how the energy could be made to remain. For
that, you need **a provable mechanism by which energy can be trapped in the
atmosphere,** and greenhouse gases provide that mechanism **.**

Next, you need a 'motive'. Why has this happened? Because **CO2 has increased
by nearly 50% in the last 150 years and the increase is from burning fossil
fuels.**

And finally, the smoking gun, the evidence that proves 'whodunit': **energy
being trapped in the atmosphere corresponds exactly to the wavelengths of
energy captured by CO2.**

The last point is what places CO2 at the scene of the crime. The investigation
by science builds up empirical evidence that proves, step by step, that man-
made carbon dioxide is causing the Earth to warm up.

Basic rebuttal written by GPWayne

**Addendum** : the opening paragraph was added on 24th October 2013 in
response to a criticism by Graeme, a participant on the Coursera Climate
Literacy course. He pointed out that the rebuttal did not make explicit that
it was man-made CO2 causing the warming, which the new paragraph makes clear.
The statement "...and humans are adding more CO2 all the time" was also added
to the 'what the science says section.

What speculative large scale effect could stem from more insulation with
unchanged energy input? Could it be similar to the effect of more energy input
with unchanged insulation?

That insulation's extent has been verified. Changes over time of outgoing long
wave radiation have been measured and shown to have decreased by the amount
expected from increased GH gases:  
Harries et al, Increases in greenhouse forcing inferred from the outgoing
longwave radiation spectra of the Earth in 1970 and 1997, Nature. 2001 Mar
15;410(6826):355-7

Abstract here:
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6826/abs/410355a0.html  
"The evolution of the Earth's climate has been extensively studied, and a
strong link between increases in surface temperatures and greenhouse gases has
been established. But this relationship is complicated by several feedback
processes—most importantly the hydrological cycle—that are not well
understood. Changes in the Earth's greenhouse effect can be detected from
variations in the spectrum of outgoing longwave radiation, which is a measure
of how the Earth cools to space and carries the imprint of the gases that are
responsible for the greenhouse effect. Here we analyse the difference between
the spectra of the outgoing longwave radiation of the Earth as measured by
orbiting spacecraft in 1970 and 1997. We find differences in the spectra that
point to long-term changes in atmospheric CH4, CO2 and O3 as well as CFC-11
and CFC-12. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for a significant
increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect that is consistent with concerns
over radiative forcing of climate."

It essentially means that there is more heat retained in the system in the
bands of the mentioned gases. It is claimed that this additional heat is
warming the climate. Is that such a bold claim?

Now, I'm sure Will Nitschke will find objections. This is where the logic
breaks down. When ample evidence has been gathered and critics of a theory
continue to refute it, because no amount of evidence can ever be satisfying
and they will not state what kind of evidence would be so, or define it in a
way that they know is impossible to reach. Indeed, there is no such thing as
absolute certainty.

                    
                                                2. **Den siste mohikanen** at 09:00 AM on 19 March, 2008
                    

"here is a clear empirical evidence that CO2 is rising, CO2 causes warming and
the expected warming is observed."

-Yes, Yes and No. CO2 is rising and we expect that to cause warming. But "the expected warming" is not observed. If by expected you mean that we have seen warming that yes, but not from CO2 alone. In fact, the IPCC uses "aerosols" to explain the cooling from 1944 to 1975, and kindly explain that we do not know much about the climatic impact of aerosols. So to say that the "expected" warming is observed is to mislead: the expected warming from KNOWN factors (i.e. such the IPCC says we know lots about) would have been a steady increase from 1944, interupted by a few volcanoes and La Ninas. 

And to answer your question:  
"What is causing the warming if not CO2?"  
The suns irradiance, cosmic rays, a positive PDO, and a range of other
factors, along with CO2.

"Why isn't rising CO2 causing the warming?"  
Well, IT DOES, albeit not all of it, but from there, it's a long way to prove
that a warming of half a degree until now will translate into an additional 5
degrees to year 2100.

The following is actually pertinant to all these threads but this one seems
the closest.

"[ Global Warming: Has the Climate Sensitivity Holy Grail Been Found?  
by Roy W. Spencer, Ph.D. updated 7:00 a.m. CDT, June 30, 2008 (The following
is a simplified version of a paper entitled "Chaotic Radiative Forcing,
Feedback Stripes, and the Overestimation of Climate Sensitivity" I submitted
on June 25, 2008 for publication in the Bulletin of the American
Meteorological Society.)  
ABSTRACT: This article addresses new satellite and modeling evidence that
previous satellite diagnoses of high climate sensitivity--which directly
translate into predictions of dangerous levels of global warming--contain a
large spurious bias. It is shown that those exaggerated estimates were the
result of faulty assumptions regarding clouds when analyzing variations in
average global temperature and average reflected sunlight off of the Earth.
Specifically, it has been assumed (explicitly or implicitly) that, for global
averages on time scales of three months or more, temperature variations cause
clouds to change, but that cloud variations do not cause temperature to
change. But when properly filtered, the satellite data reveal evidence of
cloud variations indeed causing temperature changes, and that this source of
natural climate variability biases the estimate of climate sensitivity in the
direction of a very sensitive climate system. The new interpretation suggests
a very low sensitivity. If the new sensitivity estimate is accurate, it would
suggest only 0.5 deg. C of manmade warming by the year 2100. The new
sensitivity estimate also suggests that warming over the last century can not
be explained by human greenhouse gas emissions alone, but instead might
require a mostly natural explanation. ]"

Changing the sensitivity number does change ecery argument all at once.

"Rising CO2 levels are based not on one station but over 300 stations in 66
countries (World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases). "

My count from the WDC site is 298 stations of which only 159 actually measure
CO2. The others measure different gasses. Being imprecise simply gives the
sceptics another rabbit trail to run down.

Current models have a VERY GREAT problem with clouds; even with modern
satellite imagery it is beyond our current capability to assess with any
reasonable degree of accuracy cloud distribution and density and thus the
effect on insolation.

Well, Beck's analysis seems to disprove the base line data used to start the
whole issue, so what does that do for the AGW theory??

http://www.biomind.de/nogreenhouse/daten/EE%2018-2_Beck.pdf

Even if you put a higher anomaly factor in than Beck, you still end uf with
substantially higher CO2 figures than were used to construct the AGW argument.  
It will be interesting to see the responses .....

A skeptic would easily recognise that Beck's analysis is nonsense!

see, for example, post #172 here:

Let me see if I understand this. This seems to be the argument.

First, CO2 levels are rising.

Second, CO2 is a greenhouse gas.

Third, during the last 30 years, global temperatures have been rising.

Fourth, the things that ordinary cause temperatures to rise -- such as
increased solar activity -- are not causing the current rise in temperature.

Therefore, increased C02 is causing global warming.

Of these four points, I believe that no one disputes one and two. Yes, CO2
levels are rising. Yes, CO2 is a greenhouse gas. I do not think anyone denies
either of those two assertions.

But, there are a number of points that I think an honest scientist would want
to explore. How much is CO2 rising, compared to the past? Do we have more or
less CO2 now than we did in various past times? When we put more CO2 into the
air, what happens to it? Does it get absorbed by the ocean, or does it stay in
the air forever? What other things in the atmosphere are increasing or
decreasing? I would feel much more confidence in the global warming theory if
they would address points of this sort, which seem like pretty obvious
questions to me.

But, for the moment, lets just say that points one and two are basically
undisputed. I believe that is true.

Point three is the pivot the argument. The whole theory stands or falls on it.
It is basically saying that there is a huge, unexplained increase in global
temperatures in the last 30 years, which we have to explain.

But is that true? First off, during the last ten years, there has been no
increase. Of course, one can say -- and it is true -- that a ten year period
means little or nothing in climate science.

But think about that. If ten years means nothing, why is 30 years of such huge
importance? If the whole theory rests on 30 years, but 10 of those years are
AWOL, how good is the theory?

And how can we say that the usual suspects do not explain the increase, when
there has been no increase for ten years? What we are basically talking about
is a twenty year trend, which stopped ten years ago. So what? Excuse me, but I
have read enough climate science to realize that 10 or 20 year trends do not
mean much. Most climate cycles operate over 100s if not 1000s of years.

**Response:** _" CO2 is a greenhouse gas. I do not think anyone denies either
of those two assertions"_

Sadly, there are many who deny the assertion that CO2 is a greenhouse gas,
even despite observations of an enhanced greenhouse effect. Much of the
discussion on this website of late have been on that topic alone.

_" during the last ten years, there has been no increase"_

Statistically, this isn't true, the trend in global temperature has still been
increasing. Don't fall into the trap of comparing single points in a noisy
signal - that is not the way to determine a long term trend. More importantly,
the physical reality is that the planet is still accumulating heat. There is
still an energy imbalance. Satellites and ocean heat measurements find more
energy is still coming in than going out.

I think that this post was different in the past and included a list with some
fingerprint evidence (rise of the tropopause, expansion of the hadley cell...)
with links... Where can I find this?

**Response:** Yes, sorry about removing that information. As I added in more
info to this page, I simplified the presentation lest it get too long and
unwieldy. So I've temporarily removed all the other bits and pieces until I
get organised and restructure it to a subpage somewhere. In the meantime, here
is other evidence of warming:

                    
                                                  * Surface weather station measurements
                              * Satellite measurements show that the troposphere is warming
                              * The stratosphere is cooling as predicted by anthropogenic global warming theory (this cannot be explained by solar variability)
                              * Temperatures at the ocean surface and at various ocean depths show warming as far down as 1500 meters
                              * Sea level rise
                              * Gravitometric measurements of Greenland and Antarctica show net ice loss
                              * Sea-ice loss in the Arctic is dramatically accelerating
                              * Acceleration of glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica, particularly within the last few years.
                              * The rise of the tropopause
                              * Poleward migration of species
                              * Increased intensity of hurricanes as expected from rising sea surface temperatures
                              * Accelerating decline of glaciers throughout the world
                              * Rise in temperatures at greater depths in the permafrost
                              * Rapid expansion of thermokarst lakes throughout parts of Siberia, Canada and Alaska
                              * Changes in ocean circulation as predicted by climate models, for example, with temperatures rising more quickly overland
                              * Disintegration of permafrost coastlines in the arctic
                              * Changes in the altitude of the stratosphere
                              * An energy imbalance - the earth is receiving more energy than it emits (Hansen 2005)
                              * Poleward movement of the jet streams (Archer 2008, Seidel 2007, Fu 2006)
                              * Widening of the tropical belt (Seidel 2007, Fu 2006)
                    

Note - as you say, some of the evidence listed above are unique to CO2 warming
- the carbon "fingerprint".

Loads of thanks, and good new article!

We have a rather good grasp of the current climate system. The only thing that
has change enough to warm the planet is GHG (mainly CO2) and all the
observations are consistent with that. Some people still insist that there
might be some misterious unknown thing doing it (and some other unknown thing
cancelling out the CO2 warming effect) even though there isn't any evedence at
all. It seems incredibly twisted to me.

It is false that there has been no warming during the last ten years. Why do
you cherrypick CRU instead of GISS, Rick? Do you just choose the sources that
fit your bias?:  
http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/10/a-warming-pause/

What happens if you begin one year earlier or later? A remarkable change in
your trend? That's why your 10-year trend is not significant, and that's why
30-year trends are significant, because they don't change much if you add or
remove some years:  
http://moregrumbinescience.blogspot.com/2009/01/results-on-deciding-
trends.html

Are short-term cooling trends unusual under the current global warming? No:  
http://tamino.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/breaking-records/  
http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2009GL037810.shtml

If you want to disprove global warming just on a statistical basis you will
need more than a statistically insignificant short-term cooling trend.

Thanks for the thoughtful presentation of evidence in favor of AGW.

I'm concerned with the logic of how you put your argument together on this
page, however. Your first point is that CO2 is increasing. The second is that
CO2 traps heat. OK so far.

The third point is that the earth is warming. You lose me there. The reason we
know that humans are causing the earth to warm is that the earth is warming? I
just don't see how that logically follows.

I'd really like to see a clear argument for the AGW hypothesis that separates
evidence of warming from evidence for the cause of that warming. That's what I
was hoping to find here, but did not.

**Response:** The cause of global warming is outlined above in point 2: the
enhanced greenhouse effect from increasing CO2. Point 3 (warming is happening)
is the logical consequence of Points 1 (we're raising CO2) and 2 (CO2 traps
heat). To accept the first two points, that human CO2 emissions are causing
heat to be trapped, is to accept that humans are causing the planet to
accumulate heat. With more heat in our climate, temperatures will rise.

                    
                                                11. **Tom Dayton** at 07:13 AM on 3 December, 2009
                    

David Rourke, the first point is not simply that CO2 is rising. The point
instead is that humans are causing the rise of CO2. Since that rise of CO2
increases heat retention, it does indeed follow that humans are causing a rise
of heat retention via the mechanism of increasing CO2.

                    
                                                12. **David Rourke** at 13:31 PM on 3 December, 2009
                    

Sorry if I seem dense.

Allow me to make an analogy to evolutionary theory. It is observed that
species change over time (evolution). Natural selection is a theory that
explains how that happens.

The fact of evolution doesn’t prove natural selection. Natural selection
explains evolution. If evolution did not happen (species did not change over
time) then natural selection would be in trouble, but that doesn’t mean that a
scientist can say, “Look at how these species have changed. Natural selection
is therefore proven!”

Evolution is consistent with natural selection, but evolution doesn’t prove
that the natural selection hypothesis is correct.

Instead, we accept that evolution happens (based on considerable evidence) and
compare different explanations for what causes it (natural selection vs.
Lamarckism, for example). Natural selection makes many correct predictions,
while Lamarckism makes many incorrect predictions. Therefore, natural
selection is accepted as true (as true as anything in science).

In the same manner, once we accept global warming, it does nothing to support
AGW vs. any other explanation for increased global temperatures. What testable
predictions does AGW make? What testable predictions do alternative theories
(such as increased solar activity) make? How do those predictions hold up when
compared with facts?

That’s really the case that needs to be made here, I think.

**Response:** I had hoped that I had made a clear case above not only for
global warming, but more importantly, that humans are causing global warming.
If humans are causing global warming, we expect to see an enhanced greenhouse
effect. More specifically, we expect to see the enhanced greenhouse effect at
the wavelengths that CO2 absorb energy. This has been observed both by
satellite measurements observing less infrared radiation escaping to space and
surface measurements observing more infrared radiation returning back to the
Earth's surface.

This web site and it's articles is the best (most thorough most civil, most
compact, most interesting) I have ever come across.  
If we agree that human-caused CO2 has has caused the increase in global temps,
the more difficult problem is what to do about it. Does anyone really think
the answer is electric cars? More bumper stickers? Without hyper-analysing
energy issues, it seems that the underlying belief is that we need to
substitute non-Co2 releasing energy with non-CO2 producing energy. Is this
even POSSIBLE on a global scale? And if so? Will the surge of population over
the next hundred years erase those efforts? And, is there enough time? Even if
our solutions were implemented on a a world-wide scale over the next 20 years,
how long would it take for the volume of arctic ice to re-establish itself and
confirm our "fix" has succeeded?

should have been "CO2-releasing energy"

thereisaidit,  
we already have the technology and it's improving rapidly; the only big
question is time (or probably I should say the will to act).  
We will never see the arctic, or any other impact we already caused, recover.
It's even worst, indeed; even if we act promptly we will see more degradation
of our environment. We are not even thinking of turning back to the pre-
industrial climate, we're only trying to avoid what is considered too
dangerous to afford.

I think the Skeptical Argument is improperly presented. It should rather be
presented "There is no empirical evidence or proof that humans are _[the
primary causes of current global warming trends]_. It's all based on theory
and computer models.

**Response:** Ideally, rather than use my own wording, I like to quote an
excerpt from a skeptic article - usually one that sums up the argument
succinctly and eloquently (lest I be accused of setting up a strawman
argument). I'll get around to it for this argument sooner or later.

More to the point, are there other, more prevalent sources of CO2 outside of
industrial or non-natural based carbon emissions and further, are there other
elements at play in increasing the global heat capacitance currently
perceived?

Re: #16 thereisaidit

This isn't really skeptical statements i'm saying here but:

I have two scenarios in my mind:  
1) If renewable energy is to succeed there needs to be a massive price
reduction in the price per kilowatt hour. My boss held up a $0.10AU coin and
said that is the necessary goal for renewables to compete/ensure the economy
can adjust.

This site i've listed below has some figures though it might have company bias
but as you can see in order for non CO2 producing forms of energy to flourish
there needs to be something (ie.a heavy amount of research/investment etc) to
get it there.

http://www.coldenergy.com/difference.htm

2) This second scenario isn't so pretty. This addresses the population issue
you raised. I heard an interview with Paul Ehrlich who is a Professor in
population studies. He is the author of The Population Bomb back in 1967 has
some very dire predictions about world population levels.

http://www.abc.net.au/rn/latenightlive/stories/2009/2747139.htm

On your point on the ice caps:  
This is something I don't know but even if we could magically turn off the
"CO2 emissions switch" I would think that the Artic ice loss will continue ie
no matter what we do now global warming is happening and it is only a case of
damage control reducing the extent in the rise of average temperatures in the
future.

It is wonderful to find such a detailed debate on this important topic.

Can you confirm that my understand, as outlined below, is correct, or at least
not nonsense.

As life on Earth evolved, the Earth’s atmosphere was slowly changed. The
atmosphere changed quite profoundly once the process called photosynthesis
evolved. Much of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was sucked up by
photosynthesis and transformed into oxygen and carbon. Carbon became the
building material upon which life was based, and oxygen, as we all know,
became essential for sustaining life.  
When a living thing died, the carbon that formed the building blocks of life
was often reabsorbed by the soil. This fertilised the soil, making life even
richer. Some of the carbon left when plant and animals died was subjected to
enormous pressures, and over the aeons was turned to oil and coal. Life itself
acted as means of storing carbon. In particular forests are like massive
carbon storage facilities.  
Over millions of years, as life had the effect of reducing the amount of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the Earth cooled down. This was not a smooth
process, and was subject to other variables.  
The question is this: by burning up carbon deposits that have stayed in the
ground for aeons, and also through deforestation, is man reversing a process
which took place over millions of years in a blink of the evolutionary eye.

The section "CO Traps Heat" is suffering from a logical fallacy of
Composition:

http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/composition.html

The assertion is made that increasing CO2 and other GHG's absorb more long
wave radiation and prevent it from escaping to space. This is well supported
by Harries 2001 Figure 3C. Clearly assertion this is supported by both theory
and measurement.

The fallacy comes into play when applying this to the WHOLE of the outgoing
long wave spectrum. Looking at Harries 2001 Figure 1B (not shown), the range
800-1000 cm-1 shows an increase in outgoing long wave that exceeds the
decrease due to GHG's. This observation is also present in Griggs 2004 and
Chen 2007.

Harries 2001 attributes this increase over the range 800-1000 cm-1 to 'small
residual ice crystals' not fully removed from the data due to field of view
differences between the detectors. This assertion is not supported by the
addition of the NASA AIRS satellite.

Additionally, satellite measurements of total outgoing long wave radiation
show an increasing trend with time (and CO2, although not causative).

http://www.isprs.org/publications/related/ISRSE/html/papers/332.pdf

This is critical because it calls into question the causative relationship
between "CO2 traps heat" and "Our planet is accumulating heat" in the block
diagram.

This relationship must be solid if the alarming predictions of the climate
science community are to be believed and the mitigation of climate change can
be achieved through CO2 emission reduction.

I have a question. I live in West Texas where just a few generations ago fires
used to burn up our whole world. Before the White Europeans stole the land
from my ancestors the prairies were purified and cleansed of brush and trees
by fires Native Peoples and lighting set. Millions of acers burned
uncontrolled every time it turned off dry and especially after a wet year when
we grew a lot of grass.  
Since hiways, roads, cultivated lands stop wildfires today not much of the
prairies burn anymore. In fact the pasture land is not grass it is trees,
cactus and brush. I still hear on the news of concern about co2 and other
gasses wildfires emmitt into the sky.  
So how can the nominal co2 emissions of industry cause the earth to warm when
since fires have always been a part of the enviornment?

"So how can the nominal co2 emissions of industry cause the earth to warm when
since fires have always been a part of the enviornment?"

Because the rate at which we are extracting and liberating carbon stored over
vast periods of time is as though thousands and thousands of years of
wildfires are occurring concentrated in a space of a few decades.

We're performing sort of a mini version of what happens with discontinuous
natural burps of C02 in the past. The difference is, we're mindful, nature is
not.

More precisely, by looking for carbon isotope ratios in the C02 now in the
atmosphere, we can actually identify which part is contributed by normal
processes of the type you refer to versus which are being contributed by
"sudden liberation" of the kind accompanied by fossil fuel combustion. The
measured uptick in C02 turns out be from fossil fuels.

One of the few things on which almost everyone is found in agreement!

Thanks for a wonderful site.

I do however have to take issue as I believe you are posting a strawman. The
issue is not whether or not manmade CO2 is causing warming. It is whether or
not it is going to cause catastrophic warming. No serious skeptic disputes
observations 1 and 2. IE, manmade CO2 is indeed increasing and that increasing
CO2, absent either positive or negative feedbacks, will increase the
temperature of the earth. The consensus on all sides is that a doubling of
CO2, absent feedbacks, will increase the earth’s temperature by one degree.

The models assume substantial positive feedbacks and per the IPCC, predict 2
to 6 degrees of warming per doubling of CO2. We are told that the reason we
should believe the models ability to predict the future, is because of their
ability to predict (model) the past. IE, we should believe the forecast,
because the hindcast is accurate.

Up until recently, I was prepared to accept the models hindcasting abilities.
Until I read extracts from the leaked Harry.Readme.txt file. For any of your
readers who do not know. Harry was the University of East Anglia programmer
who tried to make sense of the HADCRUT code. Here is my favourite extract.

"Here, the expected 1990-2003 period is MISSING - so the correlations aren't
so hot! Yet  
the WMO codes and station names /locations are identical (or close). What the
hell is  
supposed to happen here? Oh yeah - there is no 'supposed', I can make it up.
So I have :-)  
"

Now if ever there was a clear case for an engineering audit, not to mention a
public inquiry, this is it. See this link for more examples of the code.
http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/11/25/climategate-hide-the-decline-codified/

But let us put that aside and assume that the hindcast is correct. So the
question then is how well have observations matched the forecast. Well to
start with, I being skeptical, and having read the Harry.Readme.Txt file and
looked at www.surfacestations.org, will not trust the surface measurements.
That leaves me with the satellite measurements, UAH and RSS, and the ocean
heat content measurements, as measured by the Argos buoys. The satellites give
us 30 years of data and Argos buoys just 7.

So what do they show. Well UAH shows that there has been no statistically
significant warming for 15 years. See
http://noconsensus.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/no-warming-for-fifteen-years/.
(This data can be downloaded and you can plot it yourself to verify it) RSS’s
no statistically significant warming period is slightly shorter. For some
reason 30 years is talked about as being the timeframe required to measure
climate, so no statistically significant warming in half a climate timeframe,
strikes me as important.

What needs to be also pointed out in a discussion on the Satellite temperature
record is that three major volcanos, two of them tropical, occurred during the
first half of it. Mt St Helens, El Chichon and Pinatubo. These lowered the
global temperature during the first half of the record. (Tropical volcanos
have a higer impact on temperatures) This is best illustrated in a graph
created by Bob Tisdale here http://i44.tinypic.com/3442jo9.jpg. What he shows
is that the 1982 / 1983 El Nino was almost as powerful as the 1998 El Nino
that made 1998 the hottest year in recorded history. However temperatures were
masked by the effects of El Chichon.

What is interesting is that, even with the volcanoes skewing the earlier part
of the record, global temperatures only rose by 1.3 to 1.7 degrees per century
depending on which satellite record you want to choose (and by slightly more
if you are happy to use the surface records.) Having said that, Global Warming
theory states that the lower troposphere, where the satellites do the
measuring, should warm faster than the surface, (by about 20% per John
Christy) so a 1.3 degree per century rise in the Lower Troposphere is
equivalent to 1.1 at the surface.

And now to get to Ocean Heat Content. I do not trust any measurement before
the Argos buoys were deployed in 2003. Since then ocean heat content has
remained flat See http://bobtisdale.blogspot.com/2010/01/nodc-ocean-heat-
content-0-700-meters.html .

It should be pointed out too that the thermal mass of water is a lot greater
than that of air, so the variability of Ocean Heat Content is less. Therefore
conclusions can be drawn from much shorter periods of Ocean Heat Content than
Surface Temperatures. We have 7 years which is a quarter of a climate
timeframe, and so far, no warming.

So to summarise. I will believe it when 1) An engineering audit is done on the
surface temperature records and they are revised or confiremed. 2) The models
continue to accurately hindcast and 3) 15 years of satellite measured
temperatures match the model predictions, or 8 years of Ocean Heat Content
measurements match the model predictions.

Or they find the missing tropical hotspot fingerprint of manmade catastrophic
global warming, but that is another days discussion.

**Response:** _" No serious skeptic disputes observations 1 and 2. IE, manmade
CO2 is indeed increasing and that increasing CO2, absent either positive or
negative feedbacks, will increase the temperature of the earth"_

I wish that were true. I list a selection of skeptic articles arguing that
human contribution to atmospheric CO2 is tiny and that increasing CO2 doesn't
cause much warming. Ian Plimer who I'm sure considers himself a serious
skeptic argues both points in his book Heaven and Earth.

You do make a good point though. I thought ending this article with 'the
planet is accumulating heat' was sufficient to show humans are causing global
warming. However, I think an extra step is now required, something to the
effect of 'extra heat causes surface warming' (I'll work on a less clumsily
worded version). In other words, that our climate is sensitive to radiative
forcings. I would base this not on models but on the many papers looking at
empirical data of temperature change versus forcings to calculate climate
sensitivity.

Re ocean heat, note that the Bob Tisdale webpage you link to looks at upper
ocean heat from 0 to 700 metres deep. Upper ocean heat shows more variability
than ocean heat calculated to greater depths as the upper ocean exchanges heat
with deeper waters. Ocean heat content calculated to 2000 metres deep finds
less variability and that oceans are still accumulating heat (von Schuckmann
2009). Note - this analysis is based solely on Argo data, hence the 2003 to
2008 time frame:

It sounds as if you've been badly misinformed.

In order to get a basic understanding of this topic, start with reading
Spencer Weart's work, here:

The Discovery of Global Warming

Next, before accepting and counting on what you read on Anthony Watts' site,
take into advisement that Mr. Watts was unable to discern the difference
between temperature trends versus absolute temperature measurements. He thus
was misled into making many embarrassingly wrong statements regarding the
temperature record in the United States, as well as launching a large
volunteer effort in an attempt to prove his fallacy. Output of his project
actually helped to cement the simple wrongness of his incorrect hypothesis.

You should also take a closer look at the ARGO buoy data, from an
authoritative source. Ocean heat content has actually increased since the
inception of the ARGO program. It's rather inexplicable that anybody should
think otherwise at this late date.

Having taken all that on board, it would be good to rethink your conclusions.

40 Shades of Green,  
the strength of the AGW theory and the reason why no one has succeded to
falsify it and and make a new one is that there many lines of evidence
pointing to the same conclusions.

You do not like models? Take the CO2 forcing and a climate sensitivity from
observations and you'll still end up there. Don't like surface stations? Take
satellites, same story. And so on ...

I don't need to continue, John already did the dirty job ... ;)

As it happens, I don't think Plimer is a serious skeptic. His inability to
acknowledge the Volcano error is an embarrassment.

Interestingly, since I posted this, no less a personage than Phil Jones has
confirmed that there is no statistically significant warming for 15 years -
remember that is half a climate timeframe. His BBC piece also acknowledges the
presence of volcanos in the earlier part of the Satellite record but does not
draw the obvious conclusion that I did. IE, volcanos in the firest half
depresses temperatures, no volcanos in the second half increass them, run a
trend line over the full period and you get warming.

But then again that might be me doing a Dunning Krueger :-)

Thanks for the Schuckmann link. Will go off an read it.

40 Shades of Green,  
Phil Jones is a serious scientist in fact. If you read the whole answer, he
says that there's a trend but it is "just" not statistically significant, and
explains why. For sure he's not the kind of man that picks up an arbitrary
time span and cry no trend! no trend!  
Statistics poses limits to the minimum time length of the record that allow us
to make statements on the trend. It's not that hard to do it yourself, if you
wish, or read from one who did

David Rourke (on 3 December, 2009) is right, and the responses to his posts
are wrong! He points out a flaw in the argumentation. Faulty logic should not
be used to prove the AGW theory.

Those who opposed his criticisms did not understand basic logic. The assertion
'A implies B' says that if A occurs then B also occurs, but it does not prove
that B is always caused by A. If we observe B, we cannot be sure that the
reason is A.

Example: We know that the burning of tyres causes black smoke, but if we see
black smoke in the distance, we do not know that it comes from tyres burning.
There could be other sources.

An example from using climate data: there was a major period of continuous
global warming from 1900 to 1940. This would seem to prove that our
grandparent generation burned maybe even more oil and coal than we have done
the last 50 years, since global warming obviously did occur, and since
increased CO2 in the atmosphere is known to cause global warming.

But they did not! They added considerably less CO2 than we do now. So there
must be other explanations to global warming that have to be considered.

By the same token there could be other mechanisms in action that counteract
the effect of the (documented) increase in CO2, e.g. the oceans warm up, more
water vapour in the atmosphere, more clouds, less radiation reaches the
surface - result: global cooling or return to status quo.

                    
                                                33. **Riccardo** at 00:59 AM on 18 February, 2010
                    

Argus,  
did you ever imagined that there's not just CO2 around? Did you noticed that
you (as opposed to the climatologists) are using the wrong logic that because
there has been warming in the past (not anthropogenic for sure) current
warming can not be due to CO2? Did ever read a general climate paper where all
of what you cite ("e.g. the oceans warm up, more water vapour in the
atmosphere, more clouds, less radiation reaches the surface") are give the due
importance? Can you really belive it's so easy to dismiss a theory that has
passed through decades of scientific scrutiny before being widely accepted?

                    
                                                34. **guinganbresil** at 16:37 PM on 18 February, 2010
                    

Figure 2C from Harries 2001 is being used to show that outgoing long wave
radiation is decreasing as a result of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.

Figure 2B (not shown) indicates an increase the range 750-1000 cm^-1. The net
effect is an actual increase in OLR over time. This increase is shown
spectrally in the other papers mentioned as well (Griggs 2004, Chen 2007).
Although Harries 2001 writes it off as contaminated data - it is a real
measurement and not an artifact (Griggs 2004). The increase has been measured
in other satellite measurements of total OLR. The total OLR is increasing over
time, not decreasing.

The Earth's radiation balance is a function of the TOTAL OLR, not just the OLR
in the CO2 band. It is a fallacy of composition to conclude that a reduction
in the 15 um OLR is CAUSING Earth's warming when the TOTAL OLR is increasing.
At most you could assert that the decrease in 15 um OLR would exacerbate
warming caused by ANOTHER SOURCE.

                    
                                                35. **Riccardo** at 19:32 PM on 18 February, 2010
                    

guinganbresil,  
the increased absorption at 600 cm-1 due to CO2 together with the increase of
the thermal radiation from the surface are indeed compatible. The former is a
measure the extra heat trapped, the latter of the increased surface
temperature. The overall OLR increases/decreases if the planet is out of
equilibrium and is warming/cooling.

Riccardo,  
Yes, I know there ''there's not just CO2 around''. That is exactly my point.
Alarmists are currently blaming everything on just some added ppm:s of CO2,
where there obviously also exist other explanations of, and reasons for,
global warming.  
And no, I did not use 'wrong logic'. I did not claim that current warming 'can
not' be due to CO2. I just said that there could be other reasons as well.
Riccardo uses 'wrong logic' when he blames me of something I did not claim.  
Apparently Riccardo is not familiar with the language of logic (A implies B,
and so on), or he would have seen my point, instead of jumping onto something
I did not write.  
I was simply pointing out (as has others before me, se comments 2, 7, 10, 12)
that you cannot prove backward implication, from the knowledge of existing
forward implication.  
I will expand upon my own smoke example: We know that tyres burning cause
black smoke. Suppose we know beforehand that burning of tyres is taking place
in a suburb. Suppose we see enormous amounts of smoke from a distance. The
alarmist would then say: 'Oh my, what a lot of tyres they must be burning!'.
Yes, some smoke did come from the tyres, but what we did not know was that 98%
of the smoke came from a chemical factory that was on fire.

Argus,  
you can make all the hypothesis you wish but science teach us to test them.
You cannot not simply say there could be other unspecified causes; name them,
test them.

"obviously also exist other explanations of, and reasons for, global warming."  
I agree and this is exactly what has been done for decades by scientists. So
please start from here, give other possible explanations and test them. Unless
you prefer the kind of nihilist state of mind that becasue we can not know the
"Truth" we know nothing.

The beauty of climate science is that it will take at least 50 years to prove
or disprove any claim that is made today, and by then most of us will be dead
anyway.

You cannot test a climate theory in real life, on the real globe itself,
unless you allow for a time scale that is too long for a human scientist.

Sure, I can build a computer model to 'test' my theory, but a computer model
only yields the results I want - the results that I have built into the model,
and using the parameters that I have chosen to feed it with.

Argus,  
you do not need any computer model. Pick up the hypothetical forcing of you
choice, take the available recent or paleo data and see if they match. You
really need to do it before assuming it could be something else and stand
there forever.

Doug, thanks for the interesting links to essays on climate model history! I
have read it all, and learned that modelling has been a challenging area for
more than 100 years. Also that the models have all been very different from
each other, full of flaws and weaknesses, and afflicted with serious
simplifications that diminished their value.  
Gradually the models seem to agree more and more with each other, which is
hardly surprising since consensus is the key to progress here: you get your
report published if it gives similar results as all the other reports, and if
you don't agree you will be an outcast in the world of climate science.  
I am not much comforted, though. Climatologists don't have a very good
reputation anymore, after recent scandals with emails, and the glacier bluff.
I predict more awkward revelations to be made in times to come.

Argus, thanks for reading those. You and I differ on our interpretations of
outcomes of the narrative, particularly as regards conformist thinking
infecting science, but I'm really glad you took the time to grind through it
all.

As to email, reputations and the like, physics and mathematics are oblivious
to such things; inconsistencies and errors will inevitably reveal themselves
if such there are and that process will not take place via newspaper articles.

Actually Nobels, and other types of recognition, are not awarded for
confirming previous work.

Another interpretation of why the models are converging, is that they are
converging on a demonstrable phenomenon - much as models of the structure of
matter converged on the atomic, vs continuous, nature of matter at the end of
the 19th century.

Excellent article.

Just a quick housekeeping note: the link to Griggs 2004 no longer works (the
university have updated their website)

longer seems to be online so I had to link to the abstract.

I'm really glad there is a site like this where we can have civilized
discussions about this topic.

The information I would like to address is that greenhouse gases absorb only
certain wavelength bands. Hence, there is a maximum amount of energy that can
be absorbed out of the electromagnetic spectrum by the greenhouse gases. This
means that there is a concentration threshold for each gas whereby if the
concentration increases, no more radiative forcing is possible for that gas.
E.G. If you look at CFC-11 and HNO3 in the figure at the top of the page,
their radiances in the bands of 850-900 cm^-1 are near zero. Therefore,
increasing the concentration of HNO3 in the atmosphere will not affect
radiative forcing anymore because there is no more radiation to absorb. Now
don't get me wrong, I'm not saying increasing the concentration of
chloroflourocarbons and nitric acid in the atmosphere has no maleffects. Acid
rain and ozone depletion are two major problems with those pollutants, that is
why they are regulated. But with respect to CO2, there is a limit to the
amount of radiative forcing that can occur.

Another note is that radiative forcing does not take into account the effects
of clouds. If more energy is absorbed, more water will evaporate and convect
to the upper atmosphere forming clouds that will reflect radiation. Looking at
Ramanathan et al (Science 1989) "Cloud-Radiative Forcing and Climate: Results
from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment," the effect of clouds has a net
radiative cooling effect. Hence, the direct correlation between a greenhouse
gas increase and an increase in temperature is unfounded due to the radiative
cooling of additional cloud cover.

About the heat content increase graph, the comparison of 190,000 GW increase
should not be compared to nuclear power plant outputs of 1 GW but rather of
the amount of insolation hitting the earth from the sun of 160,000,000 GW.
That is the correct normalizing parameter. I go into detail about this on the
global warming page.

A couple of points. First, we're nowhere near saturation for CO2. Second, even
if the atmosphere as a whole were saturated, CO2 would still be low enough in
the upper atmosphere for OLR to escape even within the absorption bands.

There are references to a number of papers about this on John's page Is the
CO2 effect saturated? and much more discussion at RealClimate.

"Satellite and surface measurements find less energy is escaping to space at
CO2 absorption wavelengths. "

It would seem to me that the total radiation outgoing is the critcal number.
Of course CO2 would absorb in its natural wavelengths, but that doesn't mean
an equal amount of energy isn't going out at other wavelengths.

philc, here's a simplified way to think about it:

(1) In the pre-industrial atmosphere, total solar irradiance is in balance
with outgoing longwave radiation, giving the earth some normal temperature T.

(2) When we add CO2 to the atmosphere, this reduces outgoing longwave
radiation in the CO2 absorption bands.

(3) The earth then warms, causing more radiation to be emitted in wavelengths
that aren't absorbed by CO2.

(4) Eventually, outgoing radiation is again in balance with the incoming
radiation, but with less of it being emitted in the CO2 absorption bands, more
of it being emitted outside those bands, and a higher surface temperature.

This is not actually a perfect description of what's going on, but it's fine
at the conceptual level IMHO.

This is not empirical evidence of global warming. All you have done is air
some empirically unproven theories that may account for the current warming
and refused to consider that the same effects may be completely independent of
the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere.
