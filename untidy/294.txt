## Father Absence + Involvement | Statistics

There is a father absence crisis in America.  
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 19.7 million children, more than 1 in 4,
live without a father in the home. Consequently, there is a father factor in
nearly all social ills facing America today.  
(2017. U.S. Census Bureau. Data represent children living without a
biological, step, or adoptive father.)
