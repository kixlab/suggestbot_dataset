# Is it possible to “overdose” or have a “bad reaction” to marijuana?

Minus

A fatal overdose is unlikely, but that doesn't mean marijuana is harmless. The
signs of using too much marijuana are similar to the typical effects of using
marijuana but more severe. These signs may include extreme confusion, anxiety,
paranoia, panic, fast heart rate, delusions or hallucinations, increased blood
pressure, and severe nausea or vomiting. In some cases, these reactions can
lead to unintentional injury such as a motor vehicle crash, fall, or
poisoning.
