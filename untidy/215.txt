## **Usage**

The words people and persons can both be used as the plural of person, but
they have slightly different connotations. People is by far the commoner of
the two words and is used in most ordinary contexts: a group of people; there
were only about ten people; several thousand people have been rehoused.
Persons, on the other hand, tends now to be restricted to official or formal
contexts, as in this vehicle is authorized to carry twenty persons; no persons
admitted without a pass
