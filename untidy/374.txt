Our mission: Greenpeace is a global, independent campaigning organization that
uses peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global
environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and
peaceful future.

> "We 'bear witness' to environmental destruction in a peaceful, non-violent
manner. We use non-violent confrontation to raise the level and quality of
public debate. In exposing threats to the environment and finding solutions we
have no permanent allies or adversaries. We ensure our financial independence
from political or commercial interests."  
>  Annie Leonard, Greenpeace USA Executive Director

## Our History

A group of thoughtful, committed citizens came together in 1971 to create
Greenpeace. A handful of determined activists leased a small fishing vessel,
called the Phyllis Cormack, and set sail from Vancouver for Amchitka Island in
Alaska. Their mission was to protest U.S. nuclear testing off the coast of
Alaska with a brave act of defiance: to place themselves in harm's way.

Despite being intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard, these daring activists
sailed into history by bringing worldwide attention to the dangers of nuclear
testing.

## Our Work

That was more than 40 years ago, and in that time, Greenpeace has indeed
changed the world. And we continue to make the world a better place. Our
committed activists and supporters have come together to ban commercial
whaling, convince the world's leaders to stop nuclear testing, protect
Antarctica, and so much more.

Today, we have grown from a small group of dedicated activists to an
international organization with offices in more than 50 countries. But our
spirit and our mission remain the same. Our fight to save the planet has grown
more serious -- the threat of global warming, destruction of ancient forests,
deterioration of our oceans, and the threat of a nuclear disaster loom large.

Greenpeace is actively working to address these and other threats.

## Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

Greenpeace challenges the systems of power and privilege that destroy the
environment and place disproportionate burdens on vulnerable communities. As
Greenpeace, we know from nature that diversity is essential to life on the
planet and success in our organization.

We welcome, value, and rely on a diversity of people, cultural experiences,
and perspectives. We learn from one another. Through our campaigning, we
create solutions that promote environmental sustainability rooted in social
justice.

## Our Volunteers

We work with thousands of volunteers who are on the inside track of our
campaigns. Whether you've been an activist for decades or you're just starting
and want to learn how you can help, we have volunteer opportunities for you.

## Our Funding

Greenpeace does not solicit contributions from government or corporations, nor
will we endorse political candidates. Our 250,000 members in the United States
and 2.8 million members worldwide provide virtually all of our funding through
individual contributions. Your support provides the backbone of our
organization and is invaluable to our efforts.
