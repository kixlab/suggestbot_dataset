# Drug Use in High School

* * *

It is devastating to imagine that your teenager may be abusing drugs.
Unfortunately, it is common to find drugs and alcohol in high school, since
these substances are so easy for kids to acquire. If your high schooler is
dealing with substance addiction, get help now.

Help your teen overcome drug abuse

6 min read

## Teens are Using Drugs In High School

Your teenager might enter high school as a child, but they will graduate as a
young adult. This four-year period is transformational — full of growth,
hardships and self-discovery. It’s also an experimental time — and for
millions of teens, that means trying drugs and alcohol. Sadly, some teens
doing drugs will suffer serious consequences as a result of substance use.

Why do teenagers use drugs? There are countless reasons. Many are reacting to
peer pressure and believe turning to drugs and alcohol is how to become
popular in high school. Some use drugs to self-medicate from painful feelings.
Some teens even turn to study aid drugs like Adderall or Ritalin, because they
believe these substances will boost their grades. High school is often the
first time that kids encounter illicit substances — and the curiosity can be
too much to resist.

![Drug Use in High School](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/wp-

content/uploads/2017/05/teen-alcohol-consumption-stat-1.jpg)

## Statistics of Drug Use in High School

Facts about teenage drug and alcohol abuse reveal that 86% of this age group
know someone who smokes, drinks or does drugs during the school day.

### Alcohol

In the U.S., teens abuse alcohol more than any illicit drug. Not surprisingly,
it causes the most harm — teen alcohol abuse is responsible each year for
nearly 200,000 ER visits and 4,300 deaths among kids under 21.

  * 68% of 12th graders have tried alcohol
  * 37.4% of 12th graders drank in the last month
  * 23.5% of 10th graders drank in the last month

Among high schoolers, within the month they were surveyed:

  * 35% drank some alcohol
  * 21% binge drank (consuming an excessive amount)
  * 22% rode in someone’s car who’d been drinking
  * 10% drove after drinking

### Marijuana

In terms of illicit drugs, teens use marijuana the most. More high school
seniors smoke pot than smoke cigarettes at this point, and as of 2015, high
school seniors are about as likely to smoke weed as they are to drink.

![Drug Use in High School](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/wp-

content/uploads/2017/05/smoking-weed-school-grades-facts.jpg)

According to experts, around 13% of people who start smoking pot as teenagers
become dependent on it. Regular marijuana use can cause a drop in IQ of up to
8 points. Considering that nearly 3,300 teens try weed for the first time
every day, it’s an undeniable problem that’s impacting high schoolers
everywhere.

The stats show that marijuana use is rampant:

  * 35.1% of 12th graders have smoked pot in the past year
  * 21.3% of 12th graders have smoked pot in the last 30 days
  * 16.6% of 10th graders have smoked pot in the last 30 days
  * 6% of 12th graders say they use marijuana every day
  * 81% of 12th graders say it would be easy to get marijuana
  * Only 32% of 12th graders feel that regular marijuana use is harmful

According to one study, 12th graders who smoke marijuana are 65% more likely
to crash their car. Among 12th graders in the U.S., one out of eight drove
after smoking marijuana at some point in the last two weeks — one in five rode
with a driver who’d been smoking.

### Other Drugs Used by High Schoolers

Nearly a quarter of American high schoolers use at least one type of illicit
drug. According to a high school drug use survey from National Institute of
Drug Abuse, the next most popular drugs in high schools — especially among
12th graders — are:

  * Amphetamines
  * Adderall
  * Opioid painkillers
  * Synthetic marijuana
  * Tranquilizers
  * Cough medicine
  * Vicodin
  * Hallucinogens
  * OxyContin
  * Sedatives
  * Ecstasy (MDMA)
  * LSD
  * Cocaine
  * Ritalin
  * Inhalants
  * Salvia

Approximately 2.5% of seniors are caught up in cocaine use. This may seem
small, but it amounts to more than a million teens doing drugs that could kill
them. High school deaths are reported each year for nearly every drug on that
list. Don’t assume that your kids aren’t using, or that they’re safe from
these dangers. It’s a mistake that far too many parents have made in the past.

![Drug Use in High School](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/wp-

## Effects of Drug Use in High School

Consequences of addiction include brain abnormalities, slowed thinking and
impaired learning and memory. It can also deplete the brain of certain
chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, sending high schoolers into a prolonged
depression and leaving them susceptible for more destructive behaviors.

Alcohol abuse in high school impacts the brain just as hard as other drugs.
Memory problems and other life-long brain issues are common in high schoolers
who drink excessively. And kids who start before age 15 are 6 times more
likely to develop alcoholism later in life than individuals who wait until 21.

Substance abuse in high school can also cause stunted growth — in one study,
high school boys addicted to weed were an average of 4.6 inches shorter when
they reached age 20.

### Substance Abuse in Schools

High schoolers can find drugs through a friend, through word-of-mouth and on
the Internet. Most kids needn’t look any further than their school — nearly
44% of high school students know a classmate who sells drugs. When asked which
drugs are sold:

  * 91% said marijuana
  * 24% said prescription drugs
  * 9% said cocaine
  * 7% said ecstasy

## Does Your Teenager Need Addiction Treatment?

If you notice any signs of addiction, now is the time to reach out to a
professional. There is help for teenagers on drugs or alcohol, but the longer
that substance abuse continues, the harder it will be for your child to
recover over the long-term.

![teen boy sitting in park needing drug treatment](/wp-

content/uploads/2017/05/teen-boy-sitting-in-park-needing-drug-treatment.jpg)

We know that it can be difficult to reach out for help — especially because
our society often stigmatizes and shames people who are suffering from
addiction. But your child’s life is far more important than what your
neighbors may think. Besides, real friends will offer love and understanding,
not judgment.

Your professional of choice can help you determine the best course of action,
and whether you should begin looking into substance abuse treatment options.
Depending upon the severity of addiction, they might encourage inpatient or
outpatient drug rehab. At that point, you’d need to look into insurance for
rehab and any possible out-of-pocket costs of drug rehab treatment.

At TheRecoveryVillage.com, we can help you sort through those details —
confidentially. You are not alone — call to speak with one of our addiction
specialists today.
