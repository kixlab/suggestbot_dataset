# How Does the Angle of the Sun's Rays and Amount of Daylight Vary?

## Angle of Solar Radiation and Temperature

The angle of incoming solar radiation influences seasonal temperatures of
locations at different latitudes. When the sun’s rays strike Earth’s surface
near the equator, the incoming solar radiation is more direct (nearly
perpendicular or closer to a 90˚ angle). Therefore, the solar radiation is
concentrated over a smaller surface area, causing warmer temperatures. At
higher latitudes, the angle of solar radiation is smaller, causing energy to
be spread over a larger area of the surface and cooler temperatures. Because
the angle of radiation varies depending on the latitude, surface temperatures
on average are warmer at lower latitudes and cooler at higher latitudes (even
though higher latitudes have more hours of daylight during the summer months).

The University of Nebraska’s Daylight Simulator is a simulation showing
daylight and nighttime regions on Earth throughout the day and year.
