# Goodbye Obamacare, Hello Tort Reform

Posted by Briggs Bedigian | Jan 11, 2017 | 0 Comments

A major topic of discussion of late has been the possible repeal of the
Affordable Care Act or, Obamacare. While the possible repeal would mean
widespread changes to the American health care system, one change that has
rarely been talked about is the impact on future medical malpractice cases.

A possible replacement of the Affordable Care Act has yet to be formed but by
all accounts, any replacement would carry with it a clause that would deprive
Americans the ability to sue health care professionals for negligence that
caused physical harm.

Proponents of the repeal claim that a very real and ongoing medical
malpractice crisis is threatening American health care based upon lawsuits
they claim to be frivolous. The belief is that lawsuits are driving up
malpractice insurance premiums and forcing health care providers out of
business while doctors and hospitals live in constant fear of litigation.
Proposals have been discussed that would potentially make it easier for health
care providers to defend themselves in malpractice cases and raise the burden
of proof on patients claiming to have been injured. It is also possible that
harsh limits on damage awards could be implemented.

However, America may not be facing any type of medical malpractice crisis. It
has been reported that health care providers are paying less for malpractice
insurance than they did in 2001 and the rate of claims has dropped by half
since 2003. Researcher, Nicholas Pace, has stated that it is a relatively calm
time for medical malpractice cases in the United States and that no such
crisis currently exists.

In fact, studies have shown that that 3% of the nation's $3.2 trillion in
health-care spending is related to malpractice cases as well as what is known
as, “defensive medicine” which involves the ordering of unnecessary tests and
treatments to protect against litigation.

Proponents of the repeal counter those numbers by claiming that a
Congressional Budget Office report suggests that major tort reform in the area
of medical malpractice would reduce health care costs by $54 billion between
2010 and 2019. However, the referenced Congressional Budget Office report is
nearly ten years old. A 2016 study performed on states that currently limit
patients' legal rights when it comes to medical negligence found that the
limitations had no impact on insurance rates for health care providers.

It remains to be seen whether Congress will put landscape altering tort reform
into place but it is definitely something to monitor as the Nation's new
administration begin making changes. It is also possible that changes could
cause heavy litigation in that the 7th Amendment could be called into question
by the reform. After all, it is that Amendment that preserves the right to
civil jury trial.

Medical malpractice can have devastating effects that last a lifetime. If you
have been injured by a physician's neglect, attorneys Charles Gilman and
Briggs Bedigian will work to get you the full compensation to which you are

If someone you are close to has been seriously injured or worse, you are
naturally devastated not only by what has happened, but by the effect that the
injury or loss has had on you and your family. At a time when you're
vulnerable, traumatized and emotionally exhausted, you need a team that will
support you through the often complex process that lies ahead.
