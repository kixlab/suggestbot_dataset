## Introduction

The term "marijuana" typically refers to the tobacco-like preparations of the
leaves and flowers of the plant Cannabis sativa. The active ingredient is
believed to be tetrahydrocannabinol, which is also responsible for
intoxication. Different preparations of marijuana vary in strength, with THC
concentration in cannabis varying with climate, soil, and cultivation
techniques. Also, the amount absorbed by the body varies with route of
administration. The effects of cannabis depend on various things: the dose,
mode of administration, user's prior experience with the drug, user's
expectations/attitudes towards the drugs, and social environment when using
the drug.

## Etiology

Marijuana intoxication is dose-related and has multiple names depending on the
preparation: grass, ganja, hashish, etc. The amount absorbed by the body
varies by the route of administration. Marijuana is commonly smoked due to the
rapid onset of symptoms, but marijuana can also be eaten, (i.e., "grass"
brownies), or drank, (i.e., marijuana tea). Smoked marijuana has an increased
potency, quoted as high as 2.6 times by some sources. Marijuana is used for
both recreational and therapeutic purposes. Although some people promote the
"harmless" nature of marijuana, acute and chronic intoxication can occur.

## Epidemiology

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), marijuana is the world's
most widely cultivated, trafficked, and abused illicit substance.
Approximately 2.5% of the world's population (147 million people) uses it. Its
use is more prevalent among men than women--a gender gap that widened in the
years 2007 to 2014. Use is widespread in the adolescent and young adult
population. According to the Monitoring the Future survey, an annual survey of
drug use in America's middle and high school students, rates of use within one
year ranged from approximately 9% in 8 graders to 35% in 12 graders. In the
United States, cannabis is still a Schedule 1, meaning it is not scheduled for
federal medical use and has a high potential for abuse.

## History and Physical

The initial state of acute intoxication formulates the symptoms that
recreational users enjoy: euphoria, perception alterations such as time and
spatial distortion, intensification of ordinary sensory experiences, and motor
impairment. Not all effects of cannabis intoxication are welcomed by users, as
some experience unpleasant psychological reactions such as panic, fear, or
depression. Acute intoxication also affects the heart and vascular system,
resulting in cannabis-induced tachycardia and postural hypotension. CNS and
respiratory depression have been noted with high doses in animal models.
Studies show that inhaled doses of 2 to 3 mg of THC and ingested doses of 5 to
20 mg THC can cause impairment of attention, memory, executive functioning,
and short-term memory. Doses > 7.5 mg/m2 inhaled in adults and oral doses from
5 to 300 mg in pediatrics can produce more severe symptoms such as
hypotension, panic, anxiety, myoclonic jerking/hyperkinesis, delirium,
respiratory depression, and ataxia. Conjunctivitis is a consistent physical
exam finding regardless of the route of administration. In children,
neurological abnormalities such as lethargy and hyperkinesis can be signs of
life-threatening toxicity. Although acute toxicity is uncommon in non-
pediatric patients, those who come to medical attention are more likely to
have hyperemesis, behavioral problems or a medical emergency such as
bronchospasm due to inhalation. There is disagreement about how long these
impairments persist after taking cannabis, ranging from hours to days. Chronic
use may lead to long-term effects on cognitive performance, "Amotivational
syndrome" (loss of energy and a will to work), and respiratory disorders.
There have also been various reports of patients presenting with cyclic
vomiting syndrome/cannabinoid hyperemesis. Cannabis intoxication can lead to
acute psychosis in many individuals and can produce short-term exacerbations
of pre-existing psychotic diseases such as schizophrenia. Psychiatric symptoms
observed in some studies include depersonalization, fear of dying, irrational
panic, and paranoid ideas.

## Evaluation

The standard urine drug screen can be used to detect THC metabolites,
primarily THC carboxylase. The lower limits range from 20 to 100 ng/mL.
Second-hand exposure causing positive results is tough to achieve in
adolescents and adults, although this has not been studied in children.
Reported false positives for THC include dronabinol, efavirenz, PPIs, hemp
seed oil, NSAIDs, and baby wash products in infants. Positive results for THC
have been reported up to 10 days after weekly use and up to 25 days for after
daily use, making the timeline of exposure different and severity of
intoxication difficult to correlate. Breathalyzer tests have been proposed,
but since small amounts of cannabis continue to be released from fat into the
blood long after short-term impairment wears off, this method has not been
promoted.

## Treatment / Management

Most adolescents and adults do not warrant testing for diagnosis or treatment
of cannabis intoxication. If chest pain is present, it is reasonable to obtain
a 12-lead electrocardiogram and possibly cardiac markers to assess for
myocardial ischemia or infarction, as there is thought to be an elevated risk
up to 4.8 times for MI within 1 hour of marijuana use. Patients with toxic
ingestion should also be screened for co-ingestion, especially if electrolyte
abnormalities or OTc or QRS prolongation is noted on EKG. Some patients,
particularly children, may require further testing if exposure is unknown,
including rapid blood glucose, electrolytes, blood gas analysis, and
neuroimaging (e.g., computed tomography of the head). Neuroimaging should be
avoided in known cannabis exposures unless focal neurologic findings are also
present or concerns for other etiologies such as head trauma exist.

The treatment for marijuana intoxication is symptomatic management. The extent
of management has numerous factors, including an age of individual and amount
of cannabis ingested. There have been several cases of accidental cannabis
poisoning in a geriatric patient resulting in intensive care admissions due to
central nervous system depression. Unintentional ingestion by children has
also resulted in similar admissions. In cannabis-induced psychotic disorders,
safe cannabis detoxication typically requires 24 hours, but sometimes longer
if persistent psychosis or unstable vital signs occur.

## Pearls and Other Issues

For obvious ethical reasons, there is no experimental evidence to determine
the lethal dose in humans; but the dose that kills animals range from 40 mg/kg
to 130 mg/kg intravenously. Well-controlled studies have not implicated in
utero marijuana exposure in any major fetal growth or physical abnormalities,
but it may have may have long-term emotional and behavioral consequences.
Marijuana has an affinity for lipids and accumulates in human milk, so its use
is contraindicated during breastfeeding.
