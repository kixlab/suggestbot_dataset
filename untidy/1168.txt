## Abstract

### Background

Involuntary admissions to psychiatric hospitals are common; however, research
examining the trends in prevalence over time and predictors is limited.

### Aims

To examine trends in prevalence and risk factors for involuntary admissions in
Ontario, Canada.

### Method

We conducted an analysis of all mental health bed admissions from 2009 to 2013
and assessed the association between patient sociodemographics, service
utilisation, pathway to care and severity characteristics for involuntary
admissions using a modified Poisson regression.

### Results

We found a high and increasing prevalence of involuntary admissions (70.7% in
2009, 77.1% in 2013, 74.1% overall). Individuals with police contact in the
prior week (risk ratio (RR) = 1.20) and immigrants both experienced greater
likelihood of being involuntarily admitted, regardless of control for other
characteristics (RR = 1.07) (both _P_ < 0.0001).

### Conclusions

We identified numerous modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for
involuntary admissions. The prevalence of involuntary admissions was high,
linearly increasing over time.

### Declaration of interest

The authors have completed the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential
Conflicts of Interest and none were reported. This study was conducted using
funding entirely from public sources. P.K. has received operational support
via an Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) Health Services
Research Fund Capacity Award to support this project. The Institute for
Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) is funded by the Ontario MOHLTC. The study
results and conclusions are those of the authors, and should not be attributed
to any of the funding agencies or sponsoring agencies. No endorsement by ICES
or the Ontario MOHLTC is intended or should be inferred. All decisions
regarding study design, publication, and data analysis were made independent
of the funding agencies.

Involuntary psychiatric hospital admissions generally occur when an individual
with mental illness is admitted to hospital against their will owing to a
perceived imminent danger to the individual or others and unwillingness to
remain in hospital voluntarily. These admissions are not desirable, because
they can be disruptive to the patient-provider relationship and have a
negative impact on the patient's perception of their care at the time of the
admission and afterwards. 1 - 3 Although there is variability across
jurisdictions, involuntary admissions are common and increasing in high-income
countries, including several European countries such as the UK, 4 , 5 The
Netherlands 5 , 6 and Germany. 5 There are few studies investigating trends in
involuntary admissions over time in other jurisdictions.

Involuntary admission to hospital may, to some extent, be an avoidable event
if care provided in community settings mitigates psychiatric crises that
precipitate involuntary admissions. Studies mostly from Europe have shown
that, in addition to these service-related factors, risk factors for
involuntary admissions include patient sociodemographic characteristics such
as being an immigrant or ethnic minority, and clinical severity variables such
as a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. 7 - 11 Studies from other
jurisdictions are largely from the USA and emphasise the importance of
available mental health resources. 12 , 13 In Canada, the most recent country-
wide prevalence estimate of involuntary admissions (25%) was in the late
1970s. 14 One recent study among 200 patients with first-episode psychosis at
four sites in Ontario had a prevalence of involuntary admissions of 68.6%, 15
suggesting a large increase in prevalence. However, no recent population-based
Canadian study has examined prevalence of involuntary admissions among all
patients. 16 , 17 Furthermore, existing Canadian studies have examined only a
very limited set of characteristics of involuntarily admitted patients. 18 -
21 This is consistent with many international studies, which are often small
in size, based on one or a few sites, and examine only a limited number of
risk factors. The aims of this study were to determine the trends in
prevalence of involuntary admissions in a large population-based North
American sample covering the whole Province of Ontario, Canada (population ~14
million), and to examine the independent risk factors that predict involuntary
admission status in this jurisdiction.

## Methods

### Study design, setting, and participants

We examined the prevalence and risk factors of involuntary admissions among
all patients admitted to mental health and addictions (MHA) beds in Ontario,
Canada. Annual prevalence was examined from fiscal year (April 1 to March 31)
2009 to 2013, and risk factors for involuntary admission were examined for all
years pooled. The index date was defined as the admission date, and risk
factors were measured at or up to 5 years prior to index.

We included adults aged 16-105 years at index admission date who were Ontario
residents with valid health card numbers, owing to the requirement to link
across databases. We excluded any informal (decision to admit was made by a
substitute decision maker) and forensic admissions, as these patients are
ineligible for voluntary or involuntary admissions. We excluded any patients
without a linked emergency department record immediately preceding the
admission date, given that elective admissions are a different population and
a number of previous studies have taken place in the psychiatric emergency
department. For individuals with more than one admission to hospital during
the study period, we included one random admission. We also excluded
individuals without healthcare eligibility at 1 year prior to index, given
that a number of risk factors were measured in the year prior to admission.

### Data sources

We used the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System (OMHRS) to identify our
study population of patients who had been admitted to a mental health bed. The
OMHRS database uses the Resident Assessment Instrument - Mental Health (RAI-
MH), a standardised assessment instrument that captures a number of
sociodemographic characteristics, diagnoses according to the DSM-IV and
clinical assessments.

To ascertain sociodemographic information and other patient-level factors and
service use, we linked the OMHRS database to other administrative health
databases at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, including the
Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) hospital Discharge Abstract
Database (DAD), the Ontario Health Insurance Program (OHIP) physician claims
database, the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) emergency
department database, the Registered Persons Database (RPDB) and the
Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada Permanent Resident (IRCC-PR)
database.

### Involuntary admissions

Involuntary admissions are defined within OMHRS as a patient status of either
Form 1 or Form 3 at admission. Involuntary admissions in Ontario in most cases
begin in the emergency department, where a physician will complete an
Application for Psychiatric Assessment ('Form 1'); this is an involuntary hold
that allows the patient to be detained and examined for up to 72 h in a
psychiatric hospital. 22 In some cases, a Form 3 is subsequently completed to
involuntarily admit the patient for up to 2 weeks. The Form 3 is completed by
a psychiatrist, who must be a different physician than the physician who
completed the Form 1.

### Predictors of involuntary admissions

#### Sociodemographic variables

Patient sociodemographic characteristics included age (16-24, 25-44, 45-64,
65+), gender, area-level income quintiles identified with the use of the RPDB,
housing status (homeless/private/non-private) identified within OMHRS, and
immigration status identified within the IRCC-PR and categorised as immigrant
or long-term resident (including non-immigrants or immigrants migrating prior
to 1985).

#### Prior mental health service use

Past service use included whether they had had a mental health admission,
mental health emergency department visit, psychiatrist visit, or a mental
health 23 or non-mental health family physician visit within the past year
(definitions are listed in supplementary Table 1; available at
https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2017.4). In addition, we examined whether they had
any involuntary records within the past 5 years, including admissions or
physician billings for involuntary assessments.

#### Pathway to care variables

The pathway to care was defined as care received or contacts acquired during
the week prior to and including the day of the emergency department visit.
This included contact with police, out-patient visits to a psychiatrist, and
mental health and non-mental health out-patient visits to family physicians.
Physician visits were identified in the OHIP database, and mental health
visits to family physicians was identified with a validated algorithm. 23 We
also examined whether the patient arrived at the emergency department via
ambulance or had a transfer from a medical bed prior to admission to the
mental health bed.

#### Clinical variables

We included several clinical measures of patient severity. We assessed the
primary diagnoses, which included schizophrenia or psychosis, mood disorders,
anxiety disorders, dementia and all other psychiatric diagnoses. We examined
whether they had any indication of a substance misuse disorder or a
personality disorder. We identified emergency department visits that had
indication of self-harm. Specific codes for each diagnosis are listed in
supplementary Table 1. Triage status was measured on a five-point scale and
combined into low (suicidal/depressed or other milder psychiatric complaints
and not agitated), medium (acute psychosis and/or suicidal) and high triage
(patients experiencing acute psychosis/extreme agitation). 24 We also included
whether they had any comorbidities included in the Charlson comorbidity index
as assessed in the year prior to admission.

We also examined a number of InterRAI rating scales at admission, including
the Severity of Self-Harm (SOS), Risk of Harm to Others (RHO) and Self-Care
Index (SCI), which are all directly related to the criteria for involuntary
admissions and included three symptom scales, the Positive Symptoms Scale
(PSS), Mania Rating Scale (MRS) and Depression Rating Scale (DRS). 25 The SOS,
RHO and SCI are each based on predictive risk algorithms with combinations of
inputs based on individual symptoms, past behaviour, or other symptom scales.
25 Each of the PSS, MRS and DRS were based on items assessing the frequency of
symptoms in the past 3 days as: 0 (not exhibited in past 3 days), 1 (not
exhibited in the past 3 days but reported to be present), 2 (exhibited on 1-2
of the past 3 days), or 3 (exhibited daily). Each scale aggregated items to
different numbers of points based on the number of symptoms and the points
assigned to each frequency of occurrence. The range and list of symptoms
included in the calculation of each scale is shown in supplementary Table 2.

### Statistical methods

We examined the prevalence of involuntary admissions overall and by year. We
assessed the trend over time by fitting a linear time trend across the 5-year
study period using a modified Poisson regression.

We estimated the prevalence of each risk factor for both voluntary and
involuntary patients. We used a modified Poisson regression to determine the
unadjusted and multivariable adjusted association between each risk factor and
involuntary admissions. All variables were included in the multivariable model
regardless of significance. Patients with missing data were excluded from
analyses, except for individuals with missing income. All analyses were
conducted in SAS Enterprise Guide 6.1.

### Ethics committee approval

Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the Research Ethics Board at
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, Ontario.

## Results

A total of 250 773 admissions were identified between fiscal years 2009-2013
among adults living in Ontario with valid health card numbers. We excluded
informal or forensic admissions ( _n_ = 7214), individuals who had voluntary
admissions that subsequently were coded as involuntary ( _N_ = 676),
individuals without eligibility for healthcare a year prior to index ( _N_ =
2831), and individuals who lacked linked emergency department records ( _n_ =
39 589). Of the remaining 200 463 admissions, we kept one random admission per
individual ( _N_ = 84 948 admissions excluded), which resulted in a final
sample size of 115 515 patients admitted to hospital.

Among the 115 515 individuals who met inclusion criteria, 85 607 (74.1%) were
involuntarily admitted. The prevalence of involuntary admissions significantly
increased from 70.7% in 2009 to 77.1% in 2013 (RR = 1.021 per year, 95% CI
1.019-1.023; _P_ < 0.0001) (Fig. 1). 28 726 (33.6%) of individuals who were
involuntarily admitted were released within 72 h of admission. Additional
descriptive characteristics for patients by involuntary status are shown in
Table 1.

b.Multivariable model includes InterRAI clinical rating scales, but results
are shown in Fig. 2.

Almost all variables were associated with involuntary admission to hospital in
unadjusted analyses (Table 2). The strongest factors associated with increased
likelihood for involuntary admission were past week police contact (RR = 1.36,
95% CI 1.36-1.37) and severity variables including high-acuity triage status
(RR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.51-1.58) and medium triage status (RR = 1.30, 95% CI
1.27-1.33) _v._ low acuity, self-harm identified in the emergency department
contact preceding the admission (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.16-1.18). Not having a
psychotic disorder (RR = 0.83-0.93, depending on the diagnosis) and having a
mental health visit in the week preceding admission with either a family
physician (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.88-0.89) or a psychiatrist (RR = 0.94, 95% CI
0.93-0.95) were protective. These relationships were all maintained, although
slightly attenuated, in the adjusted models (Table 2). Several other variables
were also significantly associated with involuntary admission in the adjusted
models. Notably, younger age (16-24) (RR = 1.10, 95 CI 1.08-1.12), immigrant
status (RR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.06-1.08) and previous involuntary
assessments/admissions (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.08-1.10) all increased the
likelihood of involuntary admission. Meanwhile, past year mental health visits
to psychiatrists (RR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.93-0.95) were associated with a reduced
likelihood of involuntary admissions. After adjusting for other variables,
there was no association between any level of income and likelihood of
involuntary admission, and a minimal increased likelihood among males (RR =
1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.02).

The unadjusted and adjusted associations between six clinical rating scales
are shown in Fig. 2. Higher scores on all scales were associated with an
increased risk of involuntary admission, except for the DRS, where higher
scores were associated with a decreased risk of involuntary admission.

## Discussion

In this large population-based study, we found a very high prevalence of
involuntary psychiatric admissions - almost three-quarters of all hospital
admissions. The prevalence has increased steadily over the years between 2009
and 2013, from 70.7 to 77.1%. There were also significant risk factors for
involuntary admission to hospital among sociodemographic, past service
utilisation, pathway to care, and clinical severity characteristics. The
sociodemographic factors included immigration status and young age, both of
which increased involuntary admissions. Mental health service utilisation in
the prior year was also a strong predictor, with physician contact reducing
the likelihood of involuntary admission. Police contacts in the week prior to
admission, a pathway to care variable, and a number of severity variables
including triage status, self-harm and psychosis were also risk factors
increasing the likelihood of involuntary admissions.

Given previous Ontario estimates of 11-12% in the late 1970s 14 , 26 and 19.3%
in 1983, 16 , 17 our results show that there has been a dramatic four- fold
increase in the prevalence of involuntary admissions, such that three out of
four psychiatric admissions to hospital start as involuntary. Although the
prevalence of involuntary admissions has increased, current patients likely
spend much less time being detained involuntarily relative to patients who
were involuntarily admitted prior to 1978. Prior to 1978, patients were
admitted involuntarily for up to 1 month, while fewer than half of current
patients with involuntary status spend more than 3 days with involuntary
status, with 33.6% being released and 17.1% transferred to voluntary status by
day 3. Therefore, these results suggest that there is a much greater
prevalence of exposure to involuntary conditions, but for shorter periods of
time. Although involuntary admissions may help prevent suicide and homicide
among those at high risk, they represent a significant reduction in patient
autonomy and are often considered unjustified by patients. 3 Further research
is needed on the impacts of short-term involuntary admissions.

Three factors in Ontario have likely contributed to the rising involuntary
admission prevalence that we have observed over time. First, involuntary
admissions became a two-step process in 1978: an initial assessment period
lasting up to 120 h (a 'Form 1') and a subsequent involuntary hospital stay
lasting, initially, for up to 2 weeks. 27 The 120 h period was further
shortened to 72 h in 1986, and the wide application of the brief, 72-h
assessment period likely explains the high prevalence of relatively short
duration involuntary admissions we have observed. Indeed, if we remove the
approximately 50% of involuntarily admitted individuals who are either
released or made voluntary after 72 h, the prevalence of prolonged involuntary
hospital stays is closer to the reported prevalence in the 1970s. Therefore,
the revision of legislation permitting an involuntary assessment for up to 72
h appears to have had a very significant impact on the process of admission to
hospitals. Second, there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of
psychiatric hospital beds per capita in Ontario. Psychiatric beds in Ontario
dropped from 219 to 81 per 100 000 population from 1965 to 1980, 28 and
further dropped to 34.2 per 100 000 population in 2015, 29 a decline of 84.4%
over the 50-year period. The reduction in the number of hospital beds may have
resulted in the remaining beds being preferentially deployed for the most
severely ill presentations, which would be highly correlated with the need for
involuntary admission. Bed reductions have been associated with increasing
risk of involuntary admissions in England. 30

Lastly, a consequence of deinstitutionalisation has been the rapid rise in
interactions between people with severe mental illness and the police across
the developed world. 31 From 1997 to 2013, there was a 17-fold increase in the
number of police Mental Health Act apprehensions in Toronto, Ontario's largest
urban centre, from 520 to 8441. 32 Police Mental Health Act apprehensions also
rose across the province, with a 35% increase between 2003/4 and 2007. 33
Given that one of the strongest risk factors was police contact in the week
prior to admissions, these striking increases in police Mental Health Act
apprehensions are likely responsible in part for the high prevalence of
involuntary admissions found in this study. Amsterdam has seen similar trends,
with large increases in police referrals to psychiatric emergency services
accompanied by large increases in the proportion of admissions that are
involuntary. 34

### Strengths and limitations

This study represents one of the largest and most comprehensive examinations
of involuntary admissions to date. The OMHRS database collects a large number
of different sociodemographic and clinical characteristics through the use of
a standardised assessment tool (RAI-MH). Many of these clinical
characteristics were taken into consideration by the six clinical rating
scales included in the study (supplementary Table 2). Furthermore, the ability
to link with other administrative databases enabled an extensive examination
of risk factors for involuntary admissions, including utilisation of different
types of healthcare and immigration status. Lastly, the generalisability of
the findings is enhanced by the use of a population-based sample that
collected data across all Ontario psychiatric beds from over 60 hospitals.

This study is not without limitations. First, although the OMHRS database
collects data for all admissions to MHA beds, approximately 20% of MHA
admissions are to non-MHA beds captured in the DAD and were not included, as
the RAI-MH is not implemented in medical beds and most variables would be
missing. Second, the exact pathway to care is not known; we used care received
or contacts within the week prior to admission as proxies. Third, the symptom
scales were recorded on the third day of the admission, reflecting the first 3
days, which may have attenuated their associations with involuntary
admissions. However, symptoms likely only changed minimally over the course of
3 days, and having the rating scales completed 3 days after admission assures
that the assessment of symptoms was not completed by the same individual who
made the admission decision.

### International comparison of prevalence

Reviews of mostly European countries, covering the period 1971-2000, found
that the prevalence ranged from a low of 1.0% in Spain to a high of 93% in
some hospitals in Switzerland, with all other estimates less than 50%. 35 , 36
Therefore, the prevalence found in our study is among the highest reported
prevalences for a Western country. This considerable variation in prevalence
across countries likely reflects variation in data collection and definitions,
36 laws, 36 psychiatric resources, 5 , 37 cultures, 38 , 39 and societal and
physician attitudes towards involuntary admissions. 40 A key contributing
factor to the high prevalence in Ontario may be the low supply of psychiatric
beds compared with both Western 5 and Eastern European countries. 37

Studies from East Asian countries have found even higher prevalence of
involuntary admissions than found in Ontario, with one study in Korea finding
a prevalence of 91%. 38 In China, the prevalence is similarly high, with one
study reporting that 42% of admissions to hospital were involuntary and 30%
were partly voluntary. 39 In both countries, this is potentially due to a more
collectivist culture in which a family member is the deciding authority on the
involuntary admission instead of the patient. 39 However, this is not uniform
across the Asian continent, with one of the lowest reported prevalences of
4.0% found in Taiwan. 41 This is likely due to the strict criteria for
involuntary admissions that only allow involuntary admissions of patients with
psychosis and also requires non-compliance with treatment and dangerousness,
and, although families are often involved, the patient still has to provide
consent themselves. 41

### International comparison of risk factors and implications

We examined risk factors among an admitted cohort of patients, which allowed
us to isolate which factors are specifically associated with involuntary
status and not incorporated into the association factors that are associated
with the decision to admit the patient or the decision to visit an emergency
department. We found that youth aged 16-24 years were at a higher likelihood
of involuntary admissions, regardless of control for other risk factors. This
is not surprising, given the higher onset and burden of mental health
conditions in this age group, and consistent access issues with long wait
lists to receive care during a time of transition from youth to adult mental
health services. 42 Previous research on the role of age is conflicting, with
studies showing increased likelihood with younger age 11 and older age, 43 and
others finding no associations with age. 7 - 9 , 20 The elevated likelihood of
involuntary admissions among immigrants is a consistent finding in the UK and
in other European countries, especially for immigrants or ethnic minorities
from Caribbean, 7 , 11 African 7 , 11 or non-Western 8 countries or
ethnicities. Although some studies show that controlling for observable
characteristics, including greater levels of psychosis and more adversarial
pathways to care involving the justice system, explain these findings, 8 , 10
our study is not the only study to find that these factors did not explain the
excess likelihood of involuntary admissions. 7 Patients with any diagnosis
other than schizophrenia or psychosis were at lower likelihood of involuntary
admissions, which is a common finding with these conditions. 20 , 39 , 44
Psychosis is elevated among younger individuals and among immigrants, which
together suggests that individuals with psychosis may be a key target group
for future intervention studies which may help disparities among key
demographic groups. Further research is required to understand which groups of
immigrants are at excess likelihood of involuntary admission and explore
possible explanations and potential interventions to address this disparity.

Our findings of increased likelihood with adversarial routes such as police
contacts 10 , 41 , 44 and decreased likelihood with physician contact 7 are
consistent with the international literature. We also found independent
associations between past year mental health visits and visits on the pathway
to care, both with decreased likelihood of involuntary admissions. This
suggests that potential interventions to reduce the likelihood of involuntary
admission may involve increasing access to out-patient resources for patients
with severe mental illness.

A wide variety of severity measures were independently associated with an
increased likelihood of involuntary admissions beyond a primary diagnosis of
psychosis, including self-harm on the emergency department record and all
clinical rating scales except the DRS. Measures of dangerousness towards
others were the strongest predictors among symptom measures. 7 , 8 , 41 In
contrast to our findings, studies in other jurisdictions have found no
significant increase in 8 , 9 , 41 or lower likelihood 7 of involuntary
admission associated with suicide risk/self-harm, measured in this study with
the SOS scale, potentially reflecting a greater focus of involuntary
admissions on suicide prevention in Ontario, with dangerousness to self
included as an indication. The only exception to higher likelihood of
involuntary admissions with greater severity was the lower likelihood of
involuntary admission with higher ratings of depression measured by the DRS,
which has been found in other studies and has been suggested to reflect
greater levels of insight. 44 The set of factors included in this study is
more diverse and extensive than that used in most previous studies, 7 , 8 , 10
, 12 , 41 , 44 but the general finding of greater likelihood of involuntary
admissions with greater severity is a consistent finding among studies.

Although we observed differences in risk factors compared with other systems,
given differences in the legislation governing involuntary admissions and
differences in mental healthcare systems, it is difficult to explain why risk
factors may differ across systems.

### Conclusions

In conclusion, we found a very high prevalence of involuntary admissions among
Ontario residents that represents a substantial four-fold increase from the
early 1980s. Although our data are limited in explaining the cause of the high
prevalence of involuntary admissions, it is likely to be a consequence of the
introduction of short involuntary holds and a dramatic reduction in the supply
of psychiatric hospital beds. We found a significantly increased likelihood of
involuntary admissions for individuals with police contact in the prior week,
and a lower likelihood with psychiatric care, which is concerning given the
rise in police Mental Health Act apprehensions and inadequate access to
psychiatrists among those with severe mental illness. We also found increased
likelihood among immigrants, even after controlling for other factors, which
points to a potential disparity that requires further research to investigate.
In any jurisdiction, the rights of freedom for individuals need to be balanced
with the right to safety. Future research should further examine explanations
for the high prevalence of involuntary admissions and determine what system-
level changes may be able to mitigate this undesirable trend.
