## Stress symptoms: Effects on your body and behavior

By Mayo Clinic Staff

Stress symptoms may be affecting your health, even though you might not
realize it. You may think illness is to blame for that irritating headache,
your frequent insomnia or your decreased productivity at work. But stress may
actually be the cause.

### Common effects of stress

Indeed, stress symptoms can affect your body, your thoughts and feelings, and
your behavior. Being able to recognize common stress symptoms can help you
manage them. Stress that's left unchecked can contribute to many health
problems, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity and diabetes.

Common effects of stress On your body | On your mood | On your behavior  
---|---|---  
Headache | Anxiety | Overeating or undereating  
Muscle tension or pain | Restlessness | Angry outbursts  
Chest pain | Lack of motivation or focus | Drug or alcohol misuse  
Fatigue | Feeling overwhelmed | Tobacco use  
Change in sex drive | Irritability or anger | Social withdrawal  
Stomach upset | Sadness or depression | Exercising less often  
Sleep problems | |

### Act to manage stress

If you have stress symptoms, taking steps to manage your stress can have many
health benefits. Explore stress management strategies, such as:

                
                                      * Getting regular physical activity
                      * Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, tai chi or massage
                      * Keeping a sense of humor
                      * Spending time with family and friends
                      * Setting aside time for hobbies, such as reading a book or listening to music
                

Aim to find active ways to manage your stress. Inactive ways to manage stress
-- such as watching television, surfing the internet or playing video games --
may seem relaxing, but they may increase your stress over the long term.

And be sure to get plenty of sleep and eat a healthy, balanced diet. Avoid
tobacco use, excess caffeine and alcohol, and the use of illegal substances.

### When to seek help

If you're not sure if stress is the cause or if you've taken steps to control
your stress but your symptoms continue, see your doctor. Your healthcare
provider may want to check for other potential causes. Or consider seeing a
professional counselor or therapist, who can help you identify sources of your
stress and learn new coping tools.

Also, get emergency help immediately if you have chest pain, especially if you
also have shortness of breath, jaw or back pain, pain radiating into your
shoulder and arm, sweating, dizziness, or nausea. These may be warning signs
of a heart attack and not simply stress symptoms.
