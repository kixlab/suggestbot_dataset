# This Study Should End The Debate About Whether Women Regret Having Abortions

Tara Culp-Ressler writes for _ThinkProgress:_ "According to a new study that
tracked hundreds of women who had abortions, more than 95 percent of
participants reported that ending a pregnancy was the right decision for them.
Feelings of relief outweighed any negative emotions, even three years after
the procedure.

Researchers examined both women who had first-trimester abortions and women
who had procedures after that point (which are often characterized as “late-
term abortions”). When it came to women’s emotions following the abortion, or
their opinions about whether or not it was the right choice, they didn’t find
any meaningful difference between the two groups.

These findings contradict the notion that women experience negative mental
health effects after ending a pregnancy, as well as the idea that later
abortions are more psychologically traumatic."
